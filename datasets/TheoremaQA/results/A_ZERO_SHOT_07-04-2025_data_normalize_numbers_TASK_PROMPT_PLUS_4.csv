7,,"Compute $\int_{|z| = 1} z^2 sin(1/z) dz$. The answer is Ai with i denoting the imaginary unit, what is A?",-1.047,"The integral \(\int_{|z| = 1} z^2 \sin(1/z) \, dz\) is a contour integral over the unit circle \(|z| = 1\). We can expand \(\sin(1/z)\) as a power series:

\[
\sin(1/z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} \left(\frac{1}{z}\right)^{2n+1} = \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{6z^3} + \frac{1}{120z^5} - \cdots
\]

Multiplying by \(z^2\), we have:

\[
z^2 \sin(1/z) = z^2 \left( \frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{6z^3} + \frac{1}{120z^5} - \cdots \right) = z - \frac{1}{6z} + \frac{1}{120z^3} - \cdots
\]

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{|z| = 1} \left( z - \frac{1}{6z} + \frac{1}{120z^3} - \cdots \right) \, dz
\]

We can split this into separate integrals:

\[
\int_{|z| = 1} z \, dz - \frac{1}{6} \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{1}{z} \, dz + \frac{1}{120} \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{1}{z^3} \, dz - \cdots
\]

By the Cauchy Integral Theorem, the integral of any analytic function over a closed contour is zero. However, the integral of \(1/z\) over \(|z| = 1\) is \(2\pi i\) by the Cauchy Integral Formula. Therefore:

- \(\int_{|z| = 1} z \, dz = 0\)
- \(\int_{|z| = 1} \frac{1}{z} \, dz = 2\pi i\)
- \(\int_{|z| = 1} \frac{1}{z^3} \, dz = 0\) (and similarly for all other terms with \(1/z^n\) where \(n \neq 1\))

Thus, the only non-zero contribution comes from the \(-\frac{1}{6z}\) term:

\[
-\frac{1}{6} \cdot 2\pi i = -\frac{2\pi i}{6} = -\frac{\pi i}{3}
\]

Therefore, the integral evaluates to \(-\frac{\pi i}{3}\), and the value of \(A\) is:

\[
-\frac{\pi}{3}
\]

So, the final answer is:

\(-\frac{\pi}{3}\)",False,,,,,

The constant k=0.27 [Ns^2/m^2] is given. Find the distance traveled h in meters, until v=0.95$v_t$ is achieved, where $v_t$ is the terminal velocity. Return the numeric value.",345.0,"The terminal velocity \( v_t \) is achieved when the drag force equals the gravitational force. The gravitational force \( F_g \) is given by:

\[ F_g = mg \]

where \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

At terminal velocity, the drag force \( F_D = kv_t^2 \) equals the gravitational force:

\[ kv_t^2 = mg \]

Solving for \( v_t \):

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{80 \times 9.81}{0.27}} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{784.8}{0.27}} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{2907.4074} \]

\[ v_t \approx 53.92 \, \text{m/s} \]

We need to find the distance \( h \) traveled until the velocity \( v = 0.95v_t \).

\[ v = 0.95 \times 53.92 \]

\[ v \approx 51.224 \, \text{m/s} \]

The equation of motion for the parachutist is given by:

\[ m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv^2 \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ \frac{dv}{mg - kv^2} = \frac{dt}{m} \]

Integrating both sides from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 0.95v_t \) and from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = t \):

\[ \int_0^{0.95v_t} \frac{dv}{mg - kv^2} = \int_0^t \frac{dt}{m} \]

The left side is a standard integral that evaluates to:

\[ \frac{1}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - kv^2} \right) \]

Evaluating from 0 to \( 0.95v_t \):

\[ \frac{1}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) - \frac{1}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg} \right) \]

\[ = \frac{1}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) \]

The right side evaluates to:

\[ \frac{t}{m} \]

Equating both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) = \frac{t}{m} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{m}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) \]

Now, to find the distance \( h \), we use:

\[ h = \int_0^t v \, dt \]

Since \( v = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} \tanh \left( \frac{gk}{m} t \right) \), we integrate:

\[ h = \int_0^t \sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} \tanh \left( \frac{gk}{m} t \right) \, dt \]

This evaluates to:

\[ h = \frac{m}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{\cosh \left( \frac{gk}{m} t \right)}{\cosh(0)} \right) \]

Substitute \( t \) and solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{m}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{\cosh \left( \frac{gk}{m} \cdot \frac{m}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) \right)}{1} \right) \]

\[ h = \frac{m}{2k} \ln \left( \cosh \left( \frac{g}{2k} \ln \left( \frac{mg}{mg - k(0.95v_t)^2} \right) \right) \right) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ h = \frac{80}{2 \times 0.27} \ln \left( \cosh \left( \frac{9.81}{2 \times 0.27} \ln \left( \frac{784.8}{784.8 - 0.27 \times (0.95 \times 53.92)^2} \right) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = \frac{80}{0.54} \ln \left( \cosh \left( \frac{9.81}{0.54} \ln \left( \frac{784.8}{784.8 - 0.27 \times 51.224^2} \right) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh \left( 18.1667 \ln \left( \frac{784.8}{784.8 - 0.27 \times 2623.05} \right) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh \left( 18.1667 \ln \left( \frac{784.8}{784.8 - 708.2235} \right) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh \left( 18.1667 \ln \left( \frac{784.8}{76.5765} \right) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh \left( 18.1667 \ln (10.25) \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh \left( 18.1667 \times 2.3273 \right) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \cosh (42.292) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln ( \cosh (42.292) ) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \ln ( \cosh (42.292) ) \]

Since \( \cosh(x) \approx \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \) and for large \( x \), \( \cosh(x) \approx \frac{e^x}{2} \):

\[ h = 148.148 \ln \left( \frac{e^{42.292}}{2} \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \left( 42.292 - \ln(2) \right) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \times (42.292 - 0.693) \]

\[ h = 148.148 \times 41.599 \]

\[ h \approx 6160.3 \]

Find the decrease in the volume of the oil when it is subjected to a pressure increase  $\Delta p=1.6 \times 10^7 Pa$ (about 160 atm or 2300 psi). The bulk modulus of the oil is $B=5.0 \times 10^9 Pa$ (about $5.0 \times 10^4 atm$) and its compressibility is $k=1 / B=20 \times 10^{-6} atm^{-1}$. (Unit: 10^{-4} m^3),-0.8,"To find the decrease in the volume of the oil, we use the formula for compressibility:

\[
\Delta V = -V \cdot k \cdot \Delta p
\]

where:
- \( V = 0.25 \, m^3 \) is the initial volume of the oil,
- \( k = \frac{1}{B} = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, atm^{-1} \) is the compressibility,
- \( \Delta p = 1.6 \times 10^7 \, Pa \) is the pressure increase.

First, we need to convert the pressure increase from Pascals to atmospheres, knowing that \( 1 \, atm = 1.013 \times 10^5 \, Pa \):

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.6 \times 10^7 \, Pa}{1.013 \times 10^5 \, Pa/atm} \approx 158 \, atm
\]

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta V = -0.25 \, m^3 \times 20 \times 10^{-6} \, atm^{-1} \times 158 \, atm
\]

\[
\Delta V = -0.25 \times 20 \times 10^{-6} \times 158
\]

\[
\Delta V = -0.25 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-3}
\]

\[
\Delta V = -0.00079 \, m^3
\]

Convert this volume change to the unit \( 10^{-4} \, m^3 \):

\[
\Delta V = -0.00079 \, m^3 = -7.9 \times 10^{-4} \, m^3 = -7.9 \, (10^{-4} \, m^3)

The decrease in the volume of the oil is:

There are 3 links (2 intermediate nodes) between server and client and each has a transmission rate of 10Mbps. Given that the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is 30ms, the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 K bytes. Assume that TCP Reno is used, there is no loss during transmission and the headers of protocols are ignored. It is noted that the segments do experience a store-and-forward delay in intermediate routers. Determine how many ms client A takes to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request.",918,"The total time taken for client A to receive the entire file can be calculated by considering the TCP slow start and congestion avoidance phases, as well as the transmission and propagation delays.

1. **File Size and Segment Size:**
   - File size = 900 Kbytes
   - Segment size = 15 Kbytes
   - Number of segments = 900 Kbytes / 15 Kbytes = 60 segments

2. **Transmission Rate and RTT:**
   - Transmission rate = 10 Mbps = 10,000 Kbps
   - RTT = 30 ms

3. **Initial Slow-Start Threshold and Buffer Size:**
   - Slow-start threshold = 8 segments
   - Buffer size = 150 Kbytes = 10 segments (since 150 Kbytes / 15 Kbytes = 10)

4. **TCP Reno Behavior:**
   - TCP starts with a congestion window (cwnd) of 1 segment.
   - In slow start, cwnd doubles every RTT until it reaches the slow-start threshold or the buffer limit.
   - After reaching the threshold, TCP enters congestion avoidance, where cwnd increases linearly by 1 segment per RTT.

5. **Calculate Time to Send All Segments:**
   - **Slow Start Phase:**
     - RTT 1: Send 1 segment (cwnd = 1)
     - RTT 2: Send 2 segments (cwnd = 2)
     - RTT 3: Send 4 segments (cwnd = 4)
     - RTT 4: Send 8 segments (cwnd = 8)
     - Total segments sent in slow start = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 segments
     - Time for slow start = 4 RTTs = 4 * 30 ms = 120 ms

   - **Congestion Avoidance Phase:**
     - Remaining segments = 60 - 15 = 45 segments
     - Start with cwnd = 8, increase by 1 segment per RTT
     - RTT 5: Send 8 segments (cwnd = 8)
     - RTT 6: Send 9 segments (cwnd = 9)
     - RTT 7: Send 10 segments (cwnd = 10)
     - RTT 8: Send 10 segments (cwnd = 10)
     - RTT 9: Send 8 segments (cwnd = 8, only 8 left to send)
     - Total time for congestion avoidance = 5 RTTs = 5 * 30 ms = 150 ms

6. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for slow start + Time for congestion avoidance
   - Total time = 120 ms + 150 ms = 270 ms

Therefore, the total time taken for client A to receive the whole file is 270 ms.

176,,"The earth and sun are 8.3 light-minutes apart. Ignore their relative motion for this problem and assume they live in a single inertial frame, the Earth-Sun frame. Events A and B occur at t = 0 on the earth and at 2 minutes on the sun respectively. Find the time difference in minutes between the events according to an observer moving at u = 0.8c from Earth to Sun. Repeat if observer is moving in the opposite direction at u = 0.8c.",14,"The time difference between the events according to an observer moving at \( u = 0.8c \) from Earth to Sun is calculated using the Lorentz transformation for time:

\[
\Delta t' = \gamma (\Delta t - \frac{u \Delta x}{c^2})
\]

where:
- \(\Delta t = 2 \, \text{minutes}\) (time difference in the Earth-Sun frame),
- \(\Delta x = 8.3 \, \text{light-minutes}\) (distance between Earth and Sun),
- \(u = 0.8c\) (velocity of the observer),
- \(c\) is the speed of light,
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\) is the Lorentz factor.

First, calculate \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.64}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.36}} = \frac{1}{0.6} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Now, calculate \(\Delta t'\) for the observer moving from Earth to Sun:

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left(2 - \frac{0.8 \times 8.3}{1}\right)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left(2 - 6.64\right)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \times (-4.64)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = -7.7333\ldots
\]

The time difference is approximately \(-7.73\) minutes.

For the observer moving from Sun to Earth, the velocity \(u\) is \(-0.8c\):

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left(2 - \frac{-0.8 \times 8.3}{1}\right)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \left(2 + 6.64\right)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = \frac{5}{3} \times 8.64
\]

\[
\Delta t' = 14.4
\]

The time difference is approximately \(14.4\) minutes.

Thus, the time differences are \(-7.73\) and \(14.4\) minutes.

Assume also that Carl's labor demand (marginal revenue product) curve is given by l = 400 - 40MRP_l. How many workers will Carl hire to maximize his profits?",200,"To find the number of workers Carl will hire to maximize his profits, we need to equate the marginal cost of labor (MCL) with the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP_l).

1. **Supply Curve**: \( l = 80w \)
   - This implies \( w = \frac{l}{80} \).

2. **Marginal Cost of Labor (MCL)**: 
   - The total cost of labor is \( w \times l = \frac{l}{80} \times l = \frac{l^2}{80} \).
   - The marginal cost of labor is the derivative of the total cost with respect to \( l \): 
     \[
     MCL = \frac{d}{dl}\left(\frac{l^2}{80}\right) = \frac{2l}{80} = \frac{l}{40}
     \]

3. **Labor Demand (MRP_l)**: \( l = 400 - 40MRP_l \)
   - Solving for \( MRP_l \), we get:
     \[
     MRP_l = \frac{400 - l}{40}
     \]

4. **Equating MCL and MRP_l**:
   \[
   \frac{l}{40} = \frac{400 - l}{40}
   \]

5. **Solving the equation**:
   - Multiply through by 40 to clear the denominators:
     \[
     l = 400 - l
     \]
   - Add \( l \) to both sides:
     \[
     2l = 400
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     l = 200
     \]

Therefore, Carl will hire 200 workers to maximize his profits.

\]
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy) = x
\]

Substituting these into Green's Theorem gives:
\[
\iint_{R} \left( 2xy^3 - x \right) \, dA
\]

The region \( R \) is the triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), and \((1,2)\). The limits for \( x \) are from 0 to 1, and for a fixed \( x \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 2x \) (since the line from \((1,0)\) to \((1,2)\) is vertical, and the line from \((0,0)\) to \((1,2)\) has the equation \( y = 2x \)).

Thus, the double integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{2x} (2xy^3 - x) \, dy \, dx
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( y \):
\[
\int_{0}^{2x} (2xy^3 - x) \, dy = \left[ \frac{2x}{4}y^4 - xy \right]_{0}^{2x} = \left[ \frac{x}{2}(2x)^4 - x(2x) \right] - \left[ 0 - 0 \right]
\]
\[
= \frac{x}{2} \cdot 16x^4 - 2x^2 = 8x^5 - 2x^2
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (8x^5 - 2x^2) \, dx = \left[ \frac{8}{6}x^6 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 \right]_{0}^{1}
\]
\[
= \left[ \frac{4}{3}x^6 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 \right]_{0}^{1} = \left( \frac{4}{3} \cdot 1 - \frac{2}{3} \cdot 1 \right) - \left( 0 - 0 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{4}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).",False,,,,,

\[
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1}
\]

where \( f^{(n+1)}(c) \) is the \((n+1)\)-th derivative of the function evaluated at some point \( c \) in the interval between \( a \) and \( x \).

For the function \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), the derivatives are:
- \( f(x) = \sin(x) \)
- \( f'(x) = \cos(x) \)
- \( f''(x) = -\sin(x) \)
- \( f'''(x) = -\cos(x) \)
- \( f^{(4)}(x) = \sin(x) \)
- \( f^{(5)}(x) = \cos(x) \)
- \( f^{(6)}(x) = -\sin(x) \)

The fifth-degree Taylor polynomial \( P_5(x) \) is centered at \( x = 0 \), so \( a = 0 \). We are interested in the error at \( x = 1 \), and the error term involves the sixth derivative, which is \( f^{(6)}(x) = -\sin(x) \).

The Lagrange error term is:

\[
\left(\frac{1 + \cos(2x) + i\sin(2x)}{1 + \cos(2x) - i\sin(2x)}\right)^{30}
\]

First, let's simplify the fraction inside the expression. We can rewrite the numerator and the denominator in terms of exponential functions using Euler's formula:

\[
1 + \cos(2x) + i\sin(2x) = 1 + e^{i(2x)}
\]

\[
1 + \cos(2x) - i\sin(2x) = 1 + e^{-i(2x)}
\]

Thus, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{1 + e^{i(2x)}}{1 + e^{-i(2x)}}
\]

To simplify this, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\[
\frac{(1 + e^{i(2x)})(1 + e^{i(2x)})}{(1 + e^{-i(2x)})(1 + e^{i(2x)})}
\]

The denominator simplifies to:

\[
(1 + e^{-i(2x)})(1 + e^{i(2x)}) = 1 + e^{i(2x)} + e^{-i(2x)} + 1 = 2 + 2\cos(2x) = 2(1 + \cos(2x))
\]

The numerator simplifies to:

\[
(1 + e^{i(2x)})^2 = 1 + 2e^{i(2x)} + e^{i(4x)}
\]

Now, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{1 + 2e^{i(2x)} + e^{i(4x)}}{2(1 + \cos(2x))}
\]

However, we can simplify the original expression by recognizing that:

\[
\frac{1 + \cos(2x) + i\sin(2x)}{1 + \cos(2x) - i\sin(2x)} = e^{i(2x)}
\]

This is because the expression is a rotation in the complex plane, and the magnitude of the numerator and denominator are equal, leaving only the phase difference, which is \(2x\).

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(e^{i(2x)})^{30} = e^{i(60x)}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{\pi}{60}\), we have:

\[
e^{i(60 \cdot \frac{\pi}{60})} = e^{i\pi} = -1

Therefore, the final answer is:

\text{Cov}(x_1, x_1) & \text{Cov}(x_1, y_1) \\
\text{Cov}(y_1, x_1) & \text{Cov}(y_1, y_1)

- \( x_2 \) and \( y_2 \) are the second components of the vectors \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.

The covariance between two variables \( a \) and \( b \) is calculated as:

Given:

- \( \bar{x_2} = \frac{2+3+5+4}{4} = 3.5 \)
- \( \bar{y_1} = \frac{3+1+5+3}{4} = 3 \)
- \( \bar{y_2} = \frac{4+5+3+3}{4} = 3.75 \)

Now, calculate the covariances:
- \( \text{Cov}(x_1, x_1) = \frac{1}{4}((1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2) = \frac{1}{4}(2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \)

The trace of the covariance matrix is the sum of the variances (the diagonal elements):
\[
\text{Trace}(Cov) = \text{Cov}(x_1, x_1) + \text{Cov}(x_2, x_2) = 1.25 + 1.25 = 2.5

Each question reduces the number of possible values for \( X \) by a factor of 2 on average. After \( k \) questions, the expected number of remaining possible values for \( X \) is \( \frac{m}{2^k} \).

Given \( m = 2^n \), after \( n + \sqrt{n} \) questions, the expected number of remaining possible values is:
\[
\frac{2^n}{2^{n + \sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\sqrt{n}}}.

We are given:
- \(\alpha = \beta = \frac{9}{10}\), which are the probabilities that Alf and Bob tell the truth, respectively.
- \(\tau = P(T) = \frac{1}{1000}\), which is the prior probability that event T occurred.

We need to find \(P(T \mid A \cap B)\), the probability that T occurred given that both Alf and Bob assert that T occurred.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T \mid A \cap B) = \frac{P(A \cap B \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(A \cap B)}

First, calculate \(P(A \cap B \mid T)\):
- If T occurred, both Alf and Bob will assert that T occurred with probability \(\alpha \cdot \beta\).
\[
P(A \cap B \mid T) = \alpha \cdot \beta = \left(\frac{9}{10}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{9}{10}\right) = \frac{81}{100}

Next, calculate \(P(A \cap B \mid \neg T)\):
- If T did not occur, both Alf and Bob will assert that T occurred with probability \((1-\alpha) \cdot (1-\beta)\).
\[
P(A \cap B \mid \neg T) = (1-\alpha) \cdot (1-\beta) = \left(\frac{1}{10}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{10}\right) = \frac{1}{100}

Now, calculate \(P(A \cap B)\) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A \cap B \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(A \cap B \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{100} \cdot \frac{999}{1000}

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100000} + \frac{999}{100000}

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{81 + 999}{100000} = \frac{1080}{100000} = \frac{27}{2500}

\[
P(T \mid A \cap B) = \frac{\frac{81}{100000}}{\frac{27}{2500}}

The angular momentum before and after the collapse must be equal because no external torques are acting on the star.

The formula for angular momentum \( L \) of a rotating sphere is:

\[ L = I \omega \]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular speed. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[ I = \frac{2}{5} m r^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass and \( r \) is the radius.

Initially, the star has a radius \( r_i = 7 \times 10^5 \) km and rotates once in 30 days. We need to convert this period into angular speed:

\[ \omega_i = \frac{2\pi}{T} \]

where \( T = 30 \times 24 \times 3600 \) seconds (since there are 30 days, each with 24 hours, each with 3600 seconds).

After the collapse, the radius is \( r_f = 16 \) km. We need to find the final angular speed \( \omega_f \).

By conservation of angular momentum:

\[ I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f \]

Substituting the moment of inertia:

\[ \frac{2}{5} m r_i^2 \omega_i = \frac{2}{5} m r_f^2 \omega_f \]

The mass \( m \) and the factor \( \frac{2}{5} \) cancel out:

\[ r_i^2 \omega_i = r_f^2 \omega_f \]

Solving for \( \omega_f \):

\[ \omega_f = \frac{r_i^2 \omega_i}{r_f^2} \]

Substitute the known values:

(Unit: s)",0.31,"1. First, we need to find the spring constant \( k \). From Hooke's Law, \( F = kx \), where \( F = 6.0 \, \text{N} \) and \( x = 0.030 \, \text{m} \).

   \[
   k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{6.0 \, \text{N}}{0.030 \, \text{m}} = 200 \, \text{N/m}

273,,"Find the volume of a solid bounded by the elliptical paraboloid $z=2x^2 + y^2 + 1$, the plane x+y=1, and the coordinate planes.",0.75,"To find the volume of the solid bounded by the given surfaces, we need to set up a triple integral. The solid is bounded by the elliptical paraboloid \( z = 2x^2 + y^2 + 1 \), the plane \( x + y = 1 \), and the coordinate planes \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \).

First, we determine the region of integration in the \( xy \)-plane. The plane \( x + y = 1 \) intersects the coordinate axes at \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \). Thus, the region in the \( xy \)-plane is a right triangle with vertices at \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \).

The volume \( V \) of the solid can be expressed as the triple integral:
\[
V = \int_{x=0}^{1} \int_{y=0}^{1-x} \int_{z=0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} \, dz \, dy \, dx.
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{z=0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} \, dz = [z]_{0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} = 2x^2 + y^2 + 1.
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( y \):
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + y^2 + 1) \, dy = \int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + 1) \, dy + \int_{y=0}^{1-x} y^2 \, dy.
\]

The first integral is:
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + 1) \, dy = (2x^2 + 1)[y]_{0}^{1-x} = (2x^2 + 1)(1-x).
\]

The second integral is:
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} y^2 \, dy = \left[\frac{y^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{1-x} = \frac{(1-x)^3}{3}.
\]

Combine these results:
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + y^2 + 1) \, dy = (2x^2 + 1)(1-x) + \frac{(1-x)^3}{3}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
= (2x^2 + 1)(1-x) + \frac{(1-x)^3}{3} = (2x^2 + 1 - 2x^3 - x^2) + \frac{1 - 3x + 3x^2 - x^3}{3}.
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
= (2x^2 - x^2 + 1 - 2x^3) + \frac{1}{3} - x + x^2 - \frac{x^3}{3}.
\]

Simplify further:
\[
= x^2 + 1 - 2x^3 - x + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{x^3}{3}.
\]

Now integrate with respect to \( x \):
\[
\int_{x=0}^{1} \left(x^2 + 1 - 2x^3 - x + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{x^3}{3}\right) \, dx.
\]

This becomes:
\[
\int_{x=0}^{1} \left(x^2 - x - \frac{5x^3}{3} + \frac{4}{3}\right) \, dx.
\]

Integrate term by term:
\[
= \left[\frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{5x^4}{12} + \frac{4x}{3}\right]_{0}^{1}.
\]

Evaluate at the bounds:
\[
= \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{3}\right) - \left(0\right).
\]

Simplify:
\[
= \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Convert to a common denominator (12):
\[
= \frac{4}{12} - \frac{6}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{16}{12}.
\]

Combine:
\[
= \frac{4 - 6 - 5 + 16}{12} = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus, the volume of the solid is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

Note all three surfaces of this solid are included in $S$.,0.0,"To solve this problem, we will use the divergence theorem, which states:

\[
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV
\]

where \( V \) is the volume enclosed by the surface \( S \), and \( \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \) is the divergence of the vector field \( \vec{F} \).

First, we calculate the divergence of \( \vec{F} \):

\[
\vec{F} = yx^2 \vec{i} + (xy^2 - 3z^4)\vec{j} + (x^3+y^3)\vec{k}
\]

The divergence is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(yx^2) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy^2 - 3z^4) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x^3+y^3)
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(yx^2) = 2yx
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy^2 - 3z^4) = 2xy
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x^3+y^3) = 0
\]

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = 2yx + 2xy = 4xy
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the integral over the volume \( V \), which is the portion of the sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 16 \) with \( z \leq 0 \) and \( y \leq 0 \).

In spherical coordinates, the volume element is \( dV = \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta \), and the limits for \( \rho \) are from 0 to 4, for \( \phi \) from \( \pi/2 \) to \( \pi \) (since \( z \leq 0 \)), and for \( \theta \) from \( \pi \) to \( 3\pi/2 \) (since \( y \leq 0 \)).

The expression for \( x \) and \( y \) in spherical coordinates is:

\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \quad y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta
\]

Thus, \( xy = \rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\iiint_V 4xy \, dV = \int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \int_0^4 4(\rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta) \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

Simplifying:

\[
= 4 \int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \int_0^4 \rho^4 \sin^3 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

The integral over \( \rho \) is:

\[
\int_0^4 \rho^4 \, d\rho = \left[ \frac{\rho^5}{5} \right]_0^4 = \frac{1024}{5}
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is:

\[
\int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} \sin 2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \cos 2\theta \right]_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} = \frac{1}{4} [1 - (-1)] = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The integral over \( \phi \) is:

\[
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \sin^3 \phi \, d\phi = \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} (1 - \cos^2 \phi) \sin \phi \, d\phi
\]

Let \( u = \cos \phi \), \( du = -\sin \phi \, d\phi \). When \( \phi = \pi/2 \), \( u = 0 \), and when \( \phi = \pi \), \( u = -1 \).

\[
= \int_0^{-1} (1 - u^2)(-du) = \int_{-1}^{0} (1 - u^2) \, du = \left[ u - \frac{u^3}{3} \right]_{-1}^{0} = \left(0 - 0\right) - \left(-1 + \frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
4 \cdot \frac{1024}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4096}{15}
\]

Thus, the value of the surface integral is:

325,,"Malus' law: $I=I_0*cos^2($\theta$)$. Where I is the intensity of polarized light that has passed through the polarizer, I_0 is the intensity of polarized light before the polarizer, and $\theta$ is the angle between the polarized light and the polarizer. Unpolarized light passes through a polarizer. It then passes through another polarizer at angle 30 degree to the first, and then another at angle 50 degree to the second. What percentage of the original intensity was the light coming out of the third polarizer?",31.0,"The intensity of unpolarized light after passing through the first polarizer is reduced by half. Therefore, the intensity after the first polarizer is \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \).

For the second polarizer, which is at a 30-degree angle to the first, we use Malus' law:
\[ I_2 = I_1 \cdot \cos^2(30^\circ) = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3I_0}{8} \]

For the third polarizer, which is at a 50-degree angle to the second, we again use Malus' law:
\[ I_3 = I_2 \cdot \cos^2(50^\circ) = \frac{3I_0}{8} \cdot \cos^2(50^\circ) \]

The value of \(\cos(50^\circ)\) is approximately 0.6428, so:
\[ \cos^2(50^\circ) \approx (0.6428)^2 \approx 0.4132 \]

Thus:
\[ I_3 = \frac{3I_0}{8} \cdot 0.4132 = \frac{3 \times 0.4132}{8} I_0 = \frac{1.2396}{8} I_0 \approx 0.15495 I_0 \]

Therefore, the percentage of the original intensity is approximately:
\[ 0.15495 \times 100\% \approx 15.495\% \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the percentage of the original intensity is:

1. **Region where \( x + y \leq 1 \):**

   This region is a right triangle with vertices at \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \). The integral over this region is:

   \[
   \int_0^1 \int_0^{1-x} (1-x-y) \, dy \, dx
   \]

   First, integrate with respect to \( y \):

   \[
   \int_0^{1-x} (1-x-y) \, dy = \left[ (1-x)y - \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^{1-x} = (1-x)(1-x) - \frac{(1-x)^2}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   = (1-x)^2 - \frac{(1-x)^2}{2} = \frac{(1-x)^2}{2}
   \]

   Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):

   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{(1-x)^2}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 (1-x)^2 \, dx
   \]

   Let \( u = 1-x \), then \( du = -dx \), and when \( x = 0 \), \( u = 1 \); when \( x = 1 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \int_1^0 u^2 (-du) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 u^2 \, du
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{u^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

2. **Region where \( x + y > 1 \):**

   In this region, \( f(x, y) = 0 \), so the integral over this region is 0.

Therefore, the integral of \( f(x, y) \) over the entire region \( I = [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \) is:

A sled and rider with total mass 70.0 kg are pushed against the other end, compressing the spring 0.375 m. The sled is then released with zero initial velocity. What is the sled's speed (in m/s) when the spring returns to its uncompressed length?",2.83,"The problem involves converting the potential energy stored in the compressed spring into the kinetic energy of the sled and rider. 

First, convert the spring constant from N/cm to N/m:
\[ k = 40.0 \, \text{N/cm} = 4000 \, \text{N/m} \]

The potential energy stored in the spring when compressed is given by:
\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \]
where \( x = 0.375 \, \text{m} \).

Substitute the values:
\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 4000 \, \text{N/m} \times (0.375 \, \text{m})^2 \]
\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 4000 \times 0.140625 \]
\[ PE = 281.25 \, \text{J} \]

This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (KE) of the sled and rider:
\[ KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \]
where \( m = 70.0 \, \text{kg} \).

Set the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy:
\[ 281.25 = \frac{1}{2} \times 70.0 \times v^2 \]

Solve for \( v^2 \):
\[ 281.25 = 35.0 \times v^2 \]
\[ v^2 = \frac{281.25}{35.0} \]
\[ v^2 = 8.0357 \]

Take the square root to find \( v \):
\[ v = \sqrt{8.0357} \]
\[ v \approx 2.835 \, \text{m/s} \]

The sled's speed when the spring returns to its uncompressed length is approximately:
\[ 2.835 \, \text{m/s} \]

Thus, the film can be considered to be a large number of parallel binary asymmetric channels with crossover probability $1 - 100dA$. What is the capacity of a 0.1 unit area film?",10.0,"The capacity of a binary asymmetric channel is given by the formula:

\[ C = 1 - H(p) \]

where \( H(p) \) is the binary entropy function:

\[ H(p) = -p \log_2(p) - (1-p) \log_2(1-p) \]

In this problem, the crossover probability \( p \) is given as \( 1 - 100dA \).

For a 0.1 unit area film, the number of cells is \( \frac{0.1}{dA} \).

The capacity of the entire film is the sum of the capacities of all the cells, which is:

\[ C_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.1}{dA} \times (1 - H(1 - 100dA)) \]

For very small \( dA \), we can approximate \( H(1 - 100dA) \) using a Taylor expansion around \( p = 0 \):

\[ H(p) \approx p \log_2\left(\frac{1}{p}\right) \]

Thus:

\[ H(1 - 100dA) \approx (100dA) \log_2\left(\frac{1}{100dA}\right) \]

Substituting back:

\[ C_{\text{total}} \approx \frac{0.1}{dA} \times \left(1 - (100dA) \log_2\left(\frac{1}{100dA}\right)\right) \]

Simplifying:

\[ C_{\text{total}} \approx 0.1 \times \left(\frac{1}{dA} - 100 \log_2\left(\frac{1}{100dA}\right)\right) \]

As \( dA \to 0 \), the dominant term is \( \frac{1}{dA} \), and the capacity approaches 0.1.

Therefore, the capacity of the 0.1 unit area film is:

425,,Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $x^2 + 3x + 1 =0$. Compute $(x_1/(x_2 + 1))^2 + (x_2 / (x_1 + 1))^2$.,18.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to find the roots \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula, the roots are given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

For the equation \( x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives:

\[
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to compute:

\[
\left( \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1} \right)^2
\]

First, calculate \( x_2 + 1 \) and \( x_1 + 1 \):

\[
x_2 + 1 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5} + 2}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

\[
x_1 + 1 = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5} + 2}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now, compute the expressions:

\[
\frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1} = \frac{\frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}{\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}} = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{-1 - \sqrt{5}}
\]

\[
\frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1} = \frac{\frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{-1 + \sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify these, multiply the numerators and denominators by the conjugates:

\[
\frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{-1 - \sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{-1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{(-3 + \sqrt{5})(-1 + \sqrt{5})}{(-1)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2}
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
1 - 5 = -4
\]

The numerator becomes:

\[
(-3)(-1) + (-3)(\sqrt{5}) + (\sqrt{5})(-1) + (\sqrt{5})(\sqrt{5}) = 3 - 3\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5 = 8 - 4\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{-1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{8 - 4\sqrt{5}}{-4} = -2 + \sqrt{5}
\]

Similarly, for the other expression:

\[
\frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{-1 + \sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{-1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{(-3 - \sqrt{5})(-1 - \sqrt{5})}{(-1)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2}
\]

The denominator is again:

\[
1 - 5 = -4
\]

The numerator becomes:

\[
(-3)(-1) + (-3)(-\sqrt{5}) + (-\sqrt{5})(-1) + (-\sqrt{5})(-\sqrt{5}) = 3 + 3\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} + 5 = 8 + 4\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{-1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{5}}{-4} = -2 - \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, compute the squares:

\[
(-2 + \sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - 4\sqrt{5} + 5 = 9 - 4\sqrt{5}
\]

\[
(-2 - \sqrt{5})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{5} + 5 = 9 + 4\sqrt{5}
\]

Adding these:

\[
(9 - 4\sqrt{5}) + (9 + 4\sqrt{5}) = 18

The helicoid can be parameterized as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(u, v) = (u \cos v, u \sin v, v)
\]
where \( u \) is the radial distance from the origin and \( v \) is the angle in the \( xy \)-plane.

The region of interest is \( 1 \leq u \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq v \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \) (since we are in the first octant).

The partial derivatives of \( \mathbf{r} \) are:
\[
\mathbf{r}_u = (\cos v, \sin v, 0)
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}_v = (-u \sin v, u \cos v, 1)
\]

The cross product \( \mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v \) is:
\[
\mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\cos v & \sin v & 0 \\
-u \sin v & u \cos v & 1
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i}(\sin v) - \mathbf{j}(\cos v) + \mathbf{k}(u)
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:
\[
\|\mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v\| = \sqrt{(\sin v)^2 + (\cos v)^2 + u^2} = \sqrt{1 + u^2}
\]

The area of the surface is given by the integral:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + u^2} \, du \, dv
\]

First, compute the integral with respect to \( u \):
\[
\int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + u^2} \, du
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \sinh t \), \( du = \cosh t \, dt \), we have:
\[
\int \sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} \cosh t \, dt = \int \cosh^2 t \, dt
\]

Using the identity \( \cosh^2 t = \frac{1 + \cosh(2t)}{2} \), the integral becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \int (1 + \cosh(2t)) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \left( t + \frac{1}{2} \sinh(2t) \right) + C
\]

Transform back to \( u \):
\[
t = \text{arsinh}(u) = \ln(u + \sqrt{1 + u^2})
\]

Thus, the integral from 1 to 2 is:
\[
\left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(u + \sqrt{1 + u^2}) + \frac{1}{2} u \sqrt{1 + u^2} \right) \right]_1^2
\]

Evaluating this gives:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(2 + \sqrt{5}) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(1 + \sqrt{2}) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{2} \right)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(2 + \sqrt{5}) + \sqrt{5} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(1 + \sqrt{2}) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( v \):
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

Thus, the area is:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(2 + \sqrt{5}) + \sqrt{5} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln(1 + \sqrt{2}) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \right)
\]

After evaluating, the final area is approximately:

The Lagrangian is given by:
\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 2x - 5y + \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 144)
\]

Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero, we have:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2 + 2\lambda x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda x = -1
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = -5 + 2\lambda y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda y = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = x^2 + y^2 - 144 = 0
\]

From \(\lambda x = -1\), we have \(\lambda = -\frac{1}{x}\).

From \(\lambda y = \frac{5}{2}\), we have \(\lambda = \frac{5}{2y}\).

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\):
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{2y} \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2y = 5x \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -\frac{5}{2}x
\]

Substitute \(y = -\frac{5}{2}x\) into the constraint:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\frac{5}{2}x\right)^2 = 144

\[
x^2 + \frac{25}{4}x^2 = 144

   \[

   \[

The probability mass function for a geometric distribution is given by:

\[
P(X_i = x) = (1-p_i) p_i^{x-1}
\]

We need to find the probability \( P(X_1 < X_2 < X_3) \).

The probability that \( X_1 < X_2 < X_3 \) can be calculated using the law of total probability and the independence of the random variables. We can express this probability as:

\[
P(X_1 < X_2 < X_3) = \sum_{x_1=1}^{\infty} \sum_{x_2=x_1+1}^{\infty} \sum_{x_3=x_2+1}^{\infty} P(X_1 = x_1) P(X_2 = x_2) P(X_3 = x_3)
\]

Substituting the probability mass functions, we have:

\[
P(X_1 < X_2 < X_3) = \sum_{x_1=1}^{\infty} (1-p_1) p_1^{x_1-1} \sum_{x_2=x_1+1}^{\infty} (1-p_2) p_2^{x_2-1} \sum_{x_3=x_2+1}^{\infty} (1-p_3) p_3^{x_3-1}
\]

The inner sum can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. For the innermost sum:

\[
\sum_{x_3=x_2+1}^{\infty} p_3^{x_3-1} = p_3^{x_2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_3^k = p_3^{x_2} \frac{1}{1-p_3}
\]

Similarly, for the middle sum:

\[
\sum_{x_2=x_1+1}^{\infty} p_2^{x_2-1} p_3^{x_2} = (p_2 p_3)^{x_1} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (p_2 p_3)^k = (p_2 p_3)^{x_1} \frac{1}{1-p_2 p_3}
\]

Finally, for the outer sum:

\[
\sum_{x_1=1}^{\infty} p_1^{x_1-1} (p_2 p_3)^{x_1} = (p_1 p_2 p_3) \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (p_1 p_2 p_3)^k = \frac{p_1 p_2 p_3}{1-p_1 p_2 p_3}
\]

Substituting the values \( p_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), \( p_2 = \frac{1}{4} \), \( p_3 = \frac{1}{8} \), we get:

\[
p_1 p_2 p_3 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{64}

475,,"A TCP entity sends 6 segments across the Internet. The measured round-trip times (RTTM) for the 6 segments are 68ms, 42ms, 65ms, 80ms, 38ms, and 75ms, respectively. Assume that the smooth averaged RTT (RTTs) and Deviation (RTTD) was respectively 70ms and 10ms just before the first of these six samples. According to the Jacobson's algorithm, the retransmission timeout (RTO) is given by one RTTs plus 4 times the value of RTTD. Determine the value of RTO (in ms) after the six segments using the Jacobson's algorithm if the exponential smoothing parameters (a and B) are 0.15 and 0.2 for calculating RTTs and RTTD respectively.",114.28,"The Jacobson's algorithm for updating the smooth RTT (RTTs) and the deviation (RTTD) is given by:

1. Update RTTs:  
   RTTs = (1 - a) * RTTs + a * RTTM

2. Update RTTD:  
   RTTD = (1 - B) * RTTD + B * |RTTM - RTTs|

3. Calculate RTO:  
   RTO = RTTs + 4 * RTTD

Given:
- Initial RTTs = 70 ms
- Initial RTTD = 10 ms
- a = 0.15
- B = 0.2
- RTTM values: 68 ms, 42 ms, 65 ms, 80 ms, 38 ms, 75 ms

Let's calculate the RTTs and RTTD after each RTTM:

1. For RTTM = 68 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 70 + 0.15 * 68 = 69.7 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 10 + 0.2 * |68 - 69.7| = 9.74 ms

2. For RTTM = 42 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 69.7 + 0.15 * 42 = 65.045 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 9.74 + 0.2 * |42 - 65.045| = 13.062 ms

3. For RTTM = 65 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 65.045 + 0.15 * 65 = 65.03825 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 13.062 + 0.2 * |65 - 65.03825| = 10.44965 ms

4. For RTTM = 80 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 65.03825 + 0.15 * 80 = 67.2825125 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 10.44965 + 0.2 * |80 - 67.2825125| = 12.1725375 ms

5. For RTTM = 38 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 67.2825125 + 0.15 * 38 = 62.690135625 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 12.1725375 + 0.2 * |38 - 62.690135625| = 16.77777625 ms

6. For RTTM = 75 ms:
   - RTTs = (1 - 0.15) * 62.690135625 + 0.15 * 75 = 64.78661528125 ms
   - RTTD = (1 - 0.2) * 16.77777625 + 0.2 * |75 - 64.78661528125| = 15.9759228125 ms

Finally, calculate RTO:
RTO = RTTs + 4 * RTTD = 64.78661528125 + 4 * 15.9759228125 = 128.69030653125 ms

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the RTO is 129 ms.

512,,"Compute $\int_C dz / (z * (z-2)^2)dz$, where C: |z - 2| = 1. The answer is Ai with i denoting the imaginary unit, what is A?",-0.3926,"The integral \(\int_C \frac{dz}{z (z-2)^2}\) is evaluated over the contour \(C: |z - 2| = 1\). This contour is a circle centered at \(z = 2\) with radius 1.

The function \(\frac{1}{z (z-2)^2}\) has singularities at \(z = 0\) and \(z = 2\). The contour \(C\) only encloses the singularity at \(z = 2\), since \(z = 0\) is outside the circle \(|z - 2| = 1\).

The singularity at \(z = 2\) is a pole of order 2. To evaluate the integral, we use the residue theorem. The residue theorem states that if \(f(z)\) has isolated singularities inside a closed contour \(C\), then:

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, z_k)
\]

where the sum is over all singularities \(z_k\) inside \(C\).

To find the residue at \(z = 2\), we consider the function:

\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{z (z-2)^2}
\]

The residue at a pole of order 2 is given by:

\[
\text{Res}(f, 2) = \lim_{z \to 2} \frac{d}{dz} \left( (z-2)^2 f(z) \right)
\]

First, compute \((z-2)^2 f(z)\):

\[
(z-2)^2 f(z) = \frac{1}{z}
\]

Now, differentiate \(\frac{1}{z}\) with respect to \(z\):

\[
\frac{d}{dz} \left( \frac{1}{z} \right) = -\frac{1}{z^2}
\]

Evaluate this derivative at \(z = 2\):

\[
-\frac{1}{2^2} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the residue at \(z = 2\) is \(-\frac{1}{4}\).

Applying the residue theorem:

\[
\int_C \frac{dz}{z (z-2)^2} = 2\pi i \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) = -\frac{\pi i}{2}
\]

The problem states that the answer is \(Ai\), where \(A\) is the real number we need to find. Comparing \(-\frac{\pi i}{2}\) with \(Ai\), we see that \(A = -\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Therefore, the value of \(A\) is:

Let $\tau=2.5$. Determine $y(\tau)$.,2,"To solve for \( y(\tau) \) when \(\tau = 2.5\), we need to evaluate the convolution integral:

\[
y(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau-t) v(t) \, dt
\]

Given the signals:

\[
x(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & 0 \leq t \leq 3 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
v(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & 0 \leq t \leq 2 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Substitute \(\tau = 2.5\) into the integral:

\[
y(2.5) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(2.5-t) v(t) \, dt
\]

The function \(x(2.5-t)\) is non-zero when:

\[
0 \leq 2.5-t \leq 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-0.5 \leq -t \leq 2.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2.5 \leq t \leq 0.5
\]

The function \(v(t)\) is non-zero when:

\[
0 \leq t \leq 2
\]

The limits of integration are determined by the overlap of the intervals where both functions are non-zero:

\[
\max(0, -2.5) \leq t \leq \min(0.5, 2)
\]

This results in:

\[
0 \leq t \leq 0.5
\]

Within this interval, both \(x(2.5-t)\) and \(v(t)\) are equal to 1. Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
y(2.5) = \int_{0}^{0.5} 1 \cdot 1 \, dt = \int_{0}^{0.5} 1 \, dt = [t]_{0}^{0.5} = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5
\]

Thus, the value of \(y(2.5)\) is:

To solve this, we can use the residue theorem, which states that if \(f(z)\) is analytic inside and on some closed contour \(C\), except for a finite number of singularities inside \(C\), then

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, a_k)
\]

where the sum is over all singularities \(a_k\) inside \(C\).

The function \(f(z) = \frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)}\) has singularities at \(z = 0\) and \(z = 1\). Both of these points are inside the contour \(|z| = 2\).

We need to find the residues of \(f(z)\) at these points.

1. **Residue at \(z = 0\):**

   The residue of a function \(g(z) = \frac{h(z)}{z}\) at \(z = 0\) is simply \(h(0)\). Here, \(h(z) = \frac{5z - 2}{z - 1}\), so

   \[
   \text{Res}(f, 0) = \frac{5(0) - 2}{0 - 1} = \frac{-2}{-1} = 2
   \]

2. **Residue at \(z = 1\):**

   For a simple pole at \(z = 1\), the residue is given by

   \[
   \text{Res}(f, 1) = \lim_{z \to 1} (z - 1) \frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} = \lim_{z \to 1} \frac{5z - 2}{z} = \frac{5(1) - 2}{1} = 3
   \]

Now, applying the residue theorem:

\[
\int_{|z| = 2} \frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} \, dz = 2\pi i (2 + 3) = 2\pi i \cdot 5 = 10\pi i
\]

612,,"Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of independent indetically distributed random variables drawn according to the probability mass function $p(x) = N(0,1)$. Let $q(x)=N(1,1)$ be another probability mass function. Use natural logarithm to evaluate $\lim -\frac{1}{n}\log{q(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)}$ as $n \to \infty$.",1.4,"The problem involves evaluating the limit of the negative log-likelihood of a sequence of random variables under a different distribution. The random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots \) are drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, denoted as \( N(0,1) \). The function \( q(x) = N(1,1) \) represents a normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 1.

The task is to evaluate:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n} \log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)
\]

Since the random variables are independent, the joint probability mass function is the product of the individual probability mass functions:

\[
q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n q(X_i)
\]

Taking the logarithm, we have:

\[
\log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log q(X_i)
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
-\frac{1}{n} \log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log q(X_i)
\]

By the law of large numbers, as \( n \to \infty \), the average converges to the expected value:

\[
-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log q(X_i) \to -\mathbb{E}[\log q(X)]
\]

where \( X \sim N(0,1) \).

The probability density function for \( q(x) = N(1,1) \) is:

\[
q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}}
\]

Thus, the log of the density is:

\[
\log q(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{(x-1)^2}{2}
\]

The expected value is:

\[
\mathbb{E}[\log q(X)] = \mathbb{E}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{(X-1)^2}{2}\right]
\]

\[
= -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}[(X-1)^2]
\]

Since \( X \sim N(0,1) \), we have:

\[
\mathbb{E}[(X-1)^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2 - 2X + 1] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - 2\mathbb{E}[X] + 1
\]

\[
= 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathbb{E}[\log q(X)] = -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - 1
\]

Therefore, the limit is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n} \log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) + 1
\]

660,,"Compute the integral $\iint_D xy^2 dA$, where $D$ is the rectangle defined by 0 <= x <= 2 and 0 <= y <= 1.",0.66667,"The integral to be computed is \(\iint_D xy^2 \, dA\), where \(D\) is the rectangle defined by \(0 \leq x \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 1\).

We can set up the double integral as follows:

\[
\int_{x=0}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy \, dx
\]

First, we integrate with respect to \(y\):

\[
\int_{y=0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy = x \int_{y=0}^{1} y^2 \, dy
\]

The integral \(\int_{y=0}^{1} y^2 \, dy\) is computed as:

\[
\int y^2 \, dy = \frac{y^3}{3} \Bigg|_0^1 = \frac{1^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the inner integral becomes:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{3}
\]

Now, we integrate with respect to \(x\):

\[
\int_{x=0}^{2} \frac{x}{3} \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \int_{x=0}^{2} x \, dx
\]

The integral \(\int x \, dx\) is:

\[
\int x \, dx = \frac{x^2}{2} \Bigg|_0^2 = \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Thus, the outer integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Therefore, the value of the double integral is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The final answer is:

The semicircle is centered at \( C(1/2, 0) \) with a radius of \( 1/2 \). In polar coordinates, the center is at \( (r, \theta) = (1/2, 0) \).

The semicircle can be described in polar coordinates as:
- \( r \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 1/2 \).
- \( \theta \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \pi \).

The transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates is given by:
- \( x = r \cos \theta + 1/2 \)
- \( y = r \sin \theta \)

The Jacobian of the transformation is \( r \). Therefore, the integral becomes:
\[
\iint_S y \, dx \, dy = \int_0^\pi \int_0^{1/2} (r \sin \theta) \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^\pi \int_0^{1/2} r^2 \sin \theta \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_0^{1/2} r^2 \, dr = \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^{1/2} = \frac{(1/2)^3}{3} = \frac{1}{24}
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_0^\pi \sin \theta \, d\theta = \left[ -\cos \theta \right]_0^\pi = -\cos(\pi) + \cos(0) = 2
\]

Thus, the double integral evaluates to:
\[

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{\langle n \rangle} + 2^{-\langle n \rangle}}{2^n}
\]

where \(\langle n \rangle\) denotes the closest integer to \(\sqrt{n}\).

First, we determine \(\langle n \rangle\) for different ranges of \(n\). The integer \(\langle n \rangle\) is the closest integer to \(\sqrt{n}\), so we need to find the range of \(n\) for which \(\langle n \rangle = k\) for some integer \(k\).

The condition for \(\langle n \rangle = k\) is:

\[
k - 0.5 < \sqrt{n} < k + 0.5
\]

Squaring the inequality, we get:

\[
(k - 0.5)^2 < n < (k + 0.5)^2
\]

Calculating these bounds:

\[
(k - 0.5)^2 = k^2 - k + 0.25
\]
\[
(k + 0.5)^2 = k^2 + k + 0.25
\]

Thus, \(n\) ranges from \(\lceil k^2 - k + 0.25 \rceil\) to \(\lfloor k^2 + k + 0.25 \rfloor\).

For each integer \(k\), the number of integers \(n\) in this range is:

\[
\lfloor k^2 + k + 0.25 \rfloor - \lceil k^2 - k + 0.25 \rceil + 1
\]

This simplifies to approximately \(2k\) because the fractional parts cancel out, and the range is symmetric around \(k^2\).

Now, we evaluate the sum:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{\langle n \rangle} + 2^{-\langle n \rangle}}{2^n}
\]

For each \(k\), there are approximately \(2k\) terms where \(\langle n \rangle = k\). For these terms, the contribution to the sum is:

\[
\sum_{n \text{ with } \langle n \rangle = k} \frac{2^k + 2^{-k}}{2^n}
\]

The sum of the geometric series for these terms is:

\[
(2^k + 2^{-k}) \sum_{n \in \text{range}} \frac{1}{2^n}
\]

The sum \(\sum_{n \in \text{range}} \frac{1}{2^n}\) is a geometric series with first term \(\frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k + 1}}\) and approximately \(2k\) terms, so it sums to:

\[
\frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k + 1}} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2k}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k}}
\]

Thus, the contribution for each \(k\) is:

\[
(2^k + 2^{-k}) \cdot \frac{1}{2^{k^2 - k}} = \frac{2^{2k} + 1}{2^{k^2 - k}}
\]

Summing over all \(k\), the series converges to a constant value. The series is dominated by the terms where \(k\) is small, and the convergence is rapid.

\[
\Delta t' = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta t'\) is the time interval measured by the moving clock (on the shuttle),
- \(\Delta t\) is the time interval measured by the stationary clock (on Earth),
- \(v\) is the velocity of the moving clock,
- \(c\) is the speed of light (\(c = 299,792,458 \, \text{m/s}\)).

The time lost per second due to special relativity is:

\[
\Delta t - \Delta t' = \Delta t \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\right)
\]

Given:
- \(v = 7712 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\Delta t = 1 \, \text{s}\).

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta t - \Delta t' = 1 \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{(7712)^2}{(299,792,458)^2}}\right)
\]

Calculate \(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\):

\[
\frac{(7712)^2}{(299,792,458)^2} \approx 6.617 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Now calculate the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - 6.617 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2} \times 6.617 \times 10^{-11} = 1 - 3.3085 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Thus, the time lost per second is approximately:

\[
1 - (1 - 3.3085 \times 10^{-11}) = 3.3085 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}
\]

Convert this to picoseconds (1 second = \(10^{12}\) picoseconds):

\[
3.3085 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s} = 3.3085 \times 10^{-11} \times 10^{12} \, \text{ps} = 33.085 \, \text{ps}
\]

The expected time lost per second due to special relativity is approximately 33.085 picoseconds. 

The measured result is \(-295.02 \pm 0.29 \, \text{ps/s}\), which includes a predicted effect due to general relativity of \(35.0 \pm 0.06 \, \text{ps/s}\).

The expected total time lost per second, considering both special and general relativity, is:

\[
33.085 \, \text{ps/s} - 35.0 \, \text{ps/s} = -1.915 \, \text{ps/s}

The measured result is \(-295.02 \, \text{ps/s}\), which is significantly different from the expected \(-1.915 \, \text{ps/s}\).

It is known that the link capacity between client A and the server is 10 Mbps and the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is fixed at 20ms. Assume that the segment size is 20 Kbytes and the client has a receiver buffer of 200Kbytes. Assume that the window size (W) is fixed at 2. How long (in ms) does client A take to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request?,352,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for client A to receive the entire 350 Kbytes file from the server, given the constraints and parameters provided.

1. **File Size and Segment Size:**
   - File size = 350 Kbytes
   - Segment size = 20 Kbytes

   Number of segments = 350 Kbytes / 20 Kbytes = 17.5 segments

   Since we can't have half a segment, we round up to 18 segments.

2. **Window Size (W):**
   - W = 2 segments

   This means that at any given time, the server can send 2 segments before waiting for an acknowledgment.

3. **Round Trip Time (RTT):**
   - RTT = 20 ms

4. **Link Capacity:**
   - Link capacity = 10 Mbps = 10,000 Kbps

   Time to send one segment (20 Kbytes) = (20 Kbytes * 8 bits/byte) / 10,000 Kbps = 16 ms

5. **Transmission Process:**
   - The server can send 2 segments (40 Kbytes) at a time.
   - Time to send 2 segments = 2 * 16 ms = 32 ms
   - After sending 2 segments, the server waits for an acknowledgment, which takes one RTT (20 ms).

6. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - For the first 16 segments (8 windows of 2 segments each):
     - Time to send 2 segments and receive acknowledgment = 32 ms + 20 ms = 52 ms
     - Total time for 8 windows = 8 * 52 ms = 416 ms

   - For the last 2 segments (1 window):
     - Time to send 2 segments = 32 ms
     - No need to wait for acknowledgment for the last window.

   - Total time for the last window = 32 ms

7. **Total Time to Receive the File:**
   - Total time = 416 ms + 32 ms = 448 ms

Therefore, client A takes 448 ms to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request.

First, we calculate the divergence of \(\vec{F}\):
\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(-\frac{1}{2}y^2\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z).
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy) = y\),
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(-\frac{1}{2}y^2\right) = -y\),
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z) = 1\).

Thus, the divergence is:
\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = y - y + 1 = 1.
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the volume integral \(\iiint_V 1 \, dV\), which is simply the volume of the region \(V\).

The region \(V\) is bounded by the paraboloid \(z = 4 - 3x^2 - 3y^2\) and the plane \(z = 0\). The volume \(V\) is the region under the paraboloid and above the \(xy\)-plane.

To find the volume, we set up the integral in cylindrical coordinates. The equation of the paraboloid in cylindrical coordinates is \(z = 4 - 3r^2\). The limits for \(z\) are from \(0\) to \(4 - 3r^2\), and for \(r\), we find the maximum \(r\) by setting \(z = 0\):
\[
0 = 4 - 3r^2 \implies r^2 = \frac{4}{3} \implies r = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}.
\]

The volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} \int_0^{4 - 3r^2} r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate with respect to \(z\):
\[
\int_0^{4 - 3r^2} dz = 4 - 3r^2.
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \(r\):
\[
\int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} (4 - 3r^2) r \, dr = \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} (4r - 3r^3) \, dr.
\]

Calculate the integral:
\[
\int (4r - 3r^3) \, dr = 2r^2 - \frac{3}{4}r^4.
\]

Evaluate from \(0\) to \(\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}\):
\[
\left[2r^2 - \frac{3}{4}r^4\right]_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} = \left(2\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) - \frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2\right) - 0.

\[
2 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3},
\]
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{16}{9} = \frac{4}{3}.

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\frac{8}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \(\theta\):
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{4}{3} \, d\theta = \frac{4}{3} \times 2\pi = \frac{8\pi}{3}.

724,,Find the sum of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (1/e^n + 1/(n*(n+1)))$,1.581,"The given series is 

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{e^n} + \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \right)
\]

This can be split into two separate series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}
\]

**First Series:**

The first series is a geometric series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} = \frac{1/e}{1 - 1/e} = \frac{1/e}{(e-1)/e} = \frac{1}{e-1}
\]

**Second Series:**

The second series can be simplified using partial fraction decomposition:

\[
\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}
\]

Thus, the series becomes a telescoping series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right)
\]

The terms cancel out sequentially:

\[
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \cdots
\]

This results in:

\[
1
\]

**Final Sum:**

Adding the results of the two series:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} + 1
\]

Thus, the sum of the series is:

\[

First, we set up the double integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{3} \int_{-5}^{4} (2x - 4y^3) \, dx \, dy
\]

We first integrate with respect to \(x\):
\[
\int_{-5}^{4} (2x - 4y^3) \, dx = \left[ x^2 - 4y^3x \right]_{-5}^{4}
\]

Evaluating the antiderivative at the bounds:
\[
= \left( 4^2 - 4y^3 \cdot 4 \right) - \left( (-5)^2 - 4y^3 \cdot (-5) \right)
\]
\[
= (16 - 16y^3) - (25 + 20y^3)
\]
\[
= 16 - 16y^3 - 25 - 20y^3
\]
\[
= -9 - 36y^3
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \(y\):
\[
\int_{0}^{3} (-9 - 36y^3) \, dy = \left[ -9y - 36 \frac{y^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{3}
\]
\[
= \left[ -9y - 9y^4 \right]_{0}^{3}
\]

Evaluating the antiderivative at the bounds:
\[
= \left( -9 \cdot 3 - 9 \cdot 3^4 \right) - \left( -9 \cdot 0 - 9 \cdot 0^4 \right)
\]
\[
= (-27 - 9 \cdot 81) - 0
\]
\[
= -27 - 729
\]
\[
= -756
\]

Thus, the value of the double integral is \(-756\).

\[ a = \frac{v^2}{r} \]

where \( v \) is the linear speed and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

First, we need to find the linear speed \( v \). The linear speed is the circumference of the circle divided by the time it takes to make one complete circle:

\[ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} \]

where \( T \) is the period (time for one complete circle).

Given:
- \( r = 5.0 \) m
- \( T = 4.0 \) s

Calculate \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{2\pi \times 5.0}{4.0} = \frac{10\pi}{4} = 2.5\pi \]

Now, calculate the acceleration \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{(2.5\pi)^2}{5.0} \]

\[ a = \frac{6.25\pi^2}{5.0} \]

\[ a = 1.25\pi^2 \]

2. Decompose the fraction into partial fractions:
   \[
   \frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{A}{n+1} + \frac{B}{n+3}
   \]
   Multiply through by the denominator \((n+1)(n+3)\) to clear the fractions:
   \[
   2 = A(n+3) + B(n+1)

   Simplify and collect like terms:
   \[

   Equate coefficients:
   \[
   A + B = 0
   \]
   \[
   3A + B = 2
   \]
   Solve the system of equations:
   From \( A + B = 0 \), we have \( B = -A \).
   Substitute into the second equation:
   \[
   3A - A = 2 \implies 2A = 2 \implies A = 1

   Then \( B = -1 \).

3. Substitute back into the partial fractions:

4. Write the series:

6. Notice the cancellation pattern:
   - The \(\frac{1}{2}\) term remains.
   - The \(\frac{1}{3}\) term remains.
   - All other terms cancel out in pairs.

7. The sum of the series is the sum of the non-cancelled terms:

Note that all six sides of the box are included in $S$.",67.5,"To solve this problem, we will use the Divergence Theorem, which states:

\[
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{F}) \, dV
\]

where \( V \) is the volume enclosed by the surface \( S \).

First, we need to compute the divergence of the vector field \(\vec{F}\):

\[
\vec{F} = \sin(\pi x) \vec{i} + (z y^3) \vec{j} + (z^2 + 4x) \vec{k}
\]

The divergence \(\nabla \cdot \vec{F}\) is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\sin(\pi x)) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

1. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\sin(\pi x)) = \pi \cos(\pi x)\)
2. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) = 3z y^2\)
3. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x) = 2z\)

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \pi \cos(\pi x) + 3z y^2 + 2z
\]

Now, we integrate this divergence over the volume \( V \) of the box defined by \(-1 \le x \le 2\), \(0 \le y \le 1\), and \(1 \le z \le 4\):

\[
\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{F}) \, dV = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} (\pi \cos(\pi x) + 3z y^2 + 2z) \, dz \, dy \, dx

We can split this into three separate integrals:

\[
= \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} \pi \cos(\pi x) \, dz \, dy \, dx + \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 3z y^2 \, dz \, dy \, dx + \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 2z \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

1. The first integral:

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} \pi \cos(\pi x) \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ \pi \cos(\pi x) \cdot (4 - 1) \right] \, dy \, dx = 3\pi \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \cos(\pi x) \, dy \, dx
\]

\[
= 3\pi \int_{x=-1}^{2} \left[ \cos(\pi x) \cdot 1 \right] \, dx = 3\pi \int_{x=-1}^{2} \cos(\pi x) \, dx
\]

\[
= 3\pi \left[ \frac{1}{\pi} \sin(\pi x) \right]_{-1}^{2} = 3 \left[ \sin(2\pi) - \sin(-\pi) \right] = 3(0 - 0) = 0
\]

2. The second integral:

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 3z y^2 \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ \frac{3}{2} z^2 y^2 \right]_{1}^{4} \, dy \, dx
\]

\[
= \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ \frac{3}{2} (16 y^2 - y^2) \right] \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \frac{45}{2} y^2 \, dy \, dx
\]

\[
= \int_{x=-1}^{2} \left[ \frac{45}{6} y^3 \right]_{0}^{1} \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \frac{15}{2} \, dx = \frac{15}{2} \cdot 3 = \frac{45}{2}
\]

3. The third integral:

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 2z \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ z^2 \right]_{1}^{4} \, dy \, dx
\]

\[
= \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} (16 - 1) \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} 15 \, dy \, dx
\]

\[
= \int_{x=-1}^{2} \left[ 15y \right]_{0}^{1} \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} 15 \, dx = 15 \cdot 3 = 45

Adding these results together:

\[
0 + \frac{45}{2} + 45 = \frac{45}{2} + \frac{90}{2} = \frac{135}{2}
