22,,"The shock absorbers in an old car with mass 1000 kg are completely worn out. When a 980-N person climbs slowly into the car at its center of gravity, the car sinks 2.8 cm. The car (with the person aboard) hits a bump, and the car starts oscillating up and down in SHM. Model the car and person as a single body on a single spring, and find the frequency of the oscillation. (Unit: Hz)",0.9,"1. Calculate the spring constant (k) using the formula for the spring constant from Hooke's Law:

   \[
   k = \frac{F}{x}
   \]

   where \( F \) is the force applied (weight of the person) and \( x \) is the displacement (sinking of the car).

   Given:
   - \( F = 980 \, \text{N} \)
   - \( x = 2.8 \, \text{cm} = 0.028 \, \text{m} \)

   \[
   k = \frac{980 \, \text{N}}{0.028 \, \text{m}} = 35000 \, \text{N/m}
   \]

2. Calculate the total mass (m) of the car and the person:

   \[
   m = \text{mass of car} + \text{mass of person}
   \]

   The mass of the person can be calculated from their weight:

   \[
   \text{mass of person} = \frac{F}{g} = \frac{980 \, \text{N}}{9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 100 \, \text{kg}
   \]

   Therefore, the total mass is:

   \[
   m = 1000 \, \text{kg} + 100 \, \text{kg} = 1100 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. Calculate the frequency of oscillation (f) using the formula for the frequency of a mass-spring system:

   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
   \]

   Substituting the values of \( k \) and \( m \):

   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{35000 \, \text{N/m}}{1100 \, \text{kg}}}
   \]

   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{31.8182} \approx \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot 5.64 \approx \frac{5.64}{6.2832} \approx 0.898 \, \text{Hz}

The constant k=0.27 [Ns^2/m^2] is given. Find the distance traveled h in meters, until v=0.95$v_t$ is achieved, where $v_t$ is the terminal velocity. Return the numeric value.",345.0,"The terminal velocity \( v_t \) can be found using the equation:

\[
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}}
\]

where \( m = 80 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( k = 0.27 \, \text{Ns}^2/\text{m}^2 \).

Calculating \( v_t \):

\[
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{80 \times 9.81}{0.27}} = \sqrt{\frac{784.8}{0.27}} \approx \sqrt{2905.56} \approx 53.94 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, we need to find the distance \( h \) traveled until \( v = 0.95 v_t \):

\[
v = 0.95 v_t = 0.95 \times 53.94 \approx 51.12 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Using the equation of motion for velocity under drag, we can find the distance traveled until reaching this velocity. The equation for velocity as a function of time is:

\[
v(t) = v_t \left(1 - e^{-\frac{kt}{m}}\right)
\]

Setting \( v(t) = 0.95 v_t \):

\[
0.95 v_t = v_t \left(1 - e^{-\frac{kt}{m}}\right)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( v_t \):

\[
0.95 = 1 - e^{-\frac{kt}{m}}
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
e^{-\frac{kt}{m}} = 0.05
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{kt}{m} = \ln(0.05)
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = -\frac{m \ln(0.05)}{k}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = -\frac{80 \ln(0.05)}{0.27}
\]

Calculating \( \ln(0.05) \):

\[
\ln(0.05) \approx -2.9957
\]

Now substituting:

\[
t \approx -\frac{80 \times -2.9957}{0.27} \approx \frac{239.656}{0.27} \approx 887.6 \, \text{s}
\]

Now we can find the distance \( h \) traveled in this time using the average velocity:

The average velocity \( v_{avg} \) can be approximated as:

\[
v_{avg} = \frac{0 + v_t}{2} = \frac{0 + 53.94}{2} \approx 26.97 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, the distance \( h \) is:

\[
h = v_{avg} \times t \approx 26.97 \times 887.6 \approx 23980.5 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

23980.5

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives:

23981

- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate (5% or 0.05)
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the market returns (15% or 0.15)

Substituting the values into the formula:

1. First, we perform synthetic division of P(x) by (x - 1):

```
1 |  1  -2   4  -1  -7   5
  |      1  -1   3   2  -5
---------------------------
    1  -1   3   2  -5   0
```

The result is the polynomial Q(x) = x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 5. Since the remainder is 0, x = 1 is a root.

2. Next, we check if x = 1 is also a root of Q(x) by performing synthetic division again:

```
1 |  1  -1   3   2  -5
  |      1   0   3   5
-----------------------
    1   0   3   5   0
```

The result is R(x) = x^3 + 3x + 5. Since the remainder is 0, x = 1 is a root of Q(x) as well.

3. We check if x = 1 is a root of R(x):

```
1 |  1   0   3   5
  |      1   1   4
-----------------------
    1   1   4   9
```

The remainder is 9, so x = 1 is not a root of R(x). 

Thus, the multiplicity of the root ξ = 1 is 2.

Next, we need to calculate P'(2) + P''(2).

4. First, we find P'(x):

P'(x) = 5x^4 - 8x^3 + 12x^2 - 2 - 7 = 5x^4 - 8x^3 + 12x^2 - 7.

Now, we evaluate P'(2):

P'(2) = 5(2^4) - 8(2^3) + 12(2^2) - 7
       = 5(16) - 8(8) + 12(4) - 7
       = 80 - 64 + 48 - 7
       = 80 - 64 + 48 - 7
       = 80 - 64 + 48 - 7
       = 80 - 64 + 48 - 7
       = 16 + 48 - 7
       = 64 - 7
       = 57.

5. Next, we find P''(x):

P''(x) = 20x^3 - 24x^2 + 24.

Now, we evaluate P''(2):

P''(2) = 20(2^3) - 24(2^2) + 24
        = 20(8) - 24(4) + 24
        = 160 - 96 + 24
        = 160 - 96 + 24
        = 64 + 24
        = 88.

Finally, we calculate P'(2) + P''(2):

P'(2) + P''(2) = 57 + 88 = 145.

\[
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2} \, dx
\]

For the function \( y = x^{-1} \), we first find the derivative:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = -x^{-2}

Now, we compute \( \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 \):

\[
\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 = \left( -x^{-2} \right)^2 = x^{-4}
\]

Next, we substitute this into the arc length formula:

\[
L = \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + x^{-4}} \, dx
\]

To apply Simpson's Rule \( S_8 \), we need to divide the interval \([1, 2]\) into 8 subintervals. The width of each subinterval \( h \) is:

\[
h = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{2 - 1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}

Now we calculate \( f(x) = \sqrt{1 + x^{-4}} \) at these points:

\[
f(x_0) = \sqrt{1 + 1^{-4}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
f(x_1) = \sqrt{1 + (1.125)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.571} \approx \sqrt{1.571}
\]
\[
f(x_2) = \sqrt{1 + (1.25)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.256} \approx \sqrt{1.256}
\]
\[
f(x_3) = \sqrt{1 + (1.375)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.134} \approx \sqrt{1.134}
\]
\[
f(x_4) = \sqrt{1 + (1.5)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.0625} \approx \sqrt{1.0625}
\]
\[
f(x_5) = \sqrt{1 + (1.625)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.036} \approx \sqrt{1.036}
\]
\[
f(x_6) = \sqrt{1 + (1.75)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.020} \approx \sqrt{1.020}
\]
\[
f(x_7) = \sqrt{1 + (1.875)^{-4}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 0.011} \approx \sqrt{1.011}
\]
\[
f(x_8) = \sqrt{1 + 2^{-4}} = \sqrt{1.0625}
\]

Now we apply Simpson's Rule:

\[
L \approx \frac{h}{3} \left( f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + 2f(x_4) + 4f(x_5) + 2f(x_6) + 4f(x_7) + f(x_8) \right)
\]

Calculating the values:

\[
L \approx \frac{1/8}{3} \left( \sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{1.571} + 2\sqrt{1.256} + 4\sqrt{1.134} + 2\sqrt{1.0625} + 4\sqrt{1.036} + 2\sqrt{1.020} + 4\sqrt{1.011} + \sqrt{1.0625} \right)
\]

After evaluating the above expression, we find:

\[
L \approx 0.5
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
