12,,"Is W = {[x, y] in R^2: x >= 0 and y >= 0} a subspace of R^2?",False,"To determine if W is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), we need to check if it satisfies the three conditions for being a subspace:

1. **Contains the zero vector**: The zero vector in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is \([0, 0]\). Since \(0 \geq 0\) and \(0 \geq 0\), the zero vector is in W.

2. **Closed under addition**: For W to be closed under addition, if \([x_1, y_1]\) and \([x_2, y_2]\) are in W, then \([x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2]\) must also be in W. Consider \([x_1, y_1] = [1, 0]\) and \([x_2, y_2] = [0, 1]\), both of which are in W. Their sum is \([1 + 0, 0 + 1] = [1, 1]\), which is in W. However, consider \([x_1, y_1] = [1, 0]\) and \([x_2, y_2] = [-1, 0]\). Both vectors satisfy the condition \(x \geq 0\) and \(y \geq 0\) individually, but their sum \([1 + (-1), 0 + 0] = [0, 0]\) is in W, but if we consider \([1, 1]\) and \([-1, -1]\), their sum \([0, 0]\) is in W, but \([-1, -1]\) is not in W. This shows that W is not closed under addition.

3. **Closed under scalar multiplication**: For W to be closed under scalar multiplication, if \([x, y]\) is in W and \(c\) is any scalar, then \([cx, cy]\) must also be in W. Consider \([x, y] = [1, 1]\) which is in W. If we take \(c = -1\), then \([-1 \cdot 1, -1 \cdot 1] = [-1, -1]\), which is not in W because \(-1\) is not greater than or equal to 0.

Since W fails the closure under addition and scalar multiplication, it is not a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).

14,,True of false: one can draw a simple connected planar graph with 200 vertices and 400 faces,False,"To determine whether it is possible to draw a simple connected planar graph with 200 vertices and 400 faces, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph with \( V \) vertices, \( E \) edges, and \( F \) faces, the following relationship holds:

\[ V - E + F = 2 \]

In this problem, we are given:
- \( V = 200 \) vertices
- \( F = 400 \) faces

We need to find out if there exists a number of edges \( E \) such that the graph satisfies Euler's formula. Plugging the given values into Euler's formula, we have:

\[ 200 - E + 400 = 2 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 600 - E = 2 \]

\[ E = 598 \]

Now, we need to check if a simple connected planar graph can have 200 vertices and 598 edges. For a simple connected planar graph, there is an additional constraint given by the inequality:

\[ E \leq 3V - 6 \]

Substituting \( V = 200 \) into this inequality:

\[ E \leq 3(200) - 6 \]

\[ E \leq 600 - 6 \]

\[ E \leq 594 \]

However, we found that \( E = 598 \) is required to satisfy Euler's formula, which exceeds the maximum allowable number of edges for a simple connected planar graph with 200 vertices. Therefore, it is not possible to draw such a graph.

(a) $J_g(\theta) = 0.5J_f(\theta)$. (b) $J_g(\theta) = J_f(\theta)$. (c) $J_g(\theta) = 2J_f(\theta)$. (d) $J_g(\theta) = 4J_f(\theta)$. Which option is correct?",c,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Fisher information of a product of independent random variables and the Fisher information of each individual random variable.

Given:
- \( g_\theta(x_1, x_2) = f_\theta(x_1) f_\theta(x_2) \)

Assuming \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are independent, the joint probability density function is the product of their individual densities.

The Fisher information for a single random variable with density \( f_\theta(x) \) is given by:
\[ J_f(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x) \right)^2 \right] \]

For the joint density \( g_\theta(x_1, x_2) = f_\theta(x_1) f_\theta(x_2) \), the log-likelihood is:
\[ \log g_\theta(x_1, x_2) = \log f_\theta(x_1) + \log f_\theta(x_2) \]

The derivative with respect to \(\theta\) is:
\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log g_\theta(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) \]

The Fisher information for \( g_\theta \) is:
\[ J_g(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log g_\theta(x_1, x_2) \right)^2 \right] \]

Substituting the derivative:
\[ J_g(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) \right)^2 \right] \]

Expanding the square:
\[ J_g(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) \right)^2 + 2 \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) + \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) \right)^2 \right] \]

Since \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are independent, the cross term expectation is zero:
\[ \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) \right] = 0 \]

Thus:
\[ J_g(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_1) \right)^2 \right] + \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x_2) \right)^2 \right] \]

Since both expectations are equal to \( J_f(\theta) \), we have:
\[ J_g(\theta) = J_f(\theta) + J_f(\theta) = 2J_f(\theta) \]

Therefore, the correct relationship is:
\[ J_g(\theta) = 2J_f(\theta) \]

The correct option is (c) \( J_g(\theta) = 2J_f(\theta) \).",True,,,

32,,"Consider $x(t)$ to be given as, $$ x(t)=\cos (1000 \pi t) $$ . Let the sampling frequency be $700 \mathrm{~Hz}$. Does aliasing occur?",True,"To determine if aliasing occurs, we need to compare the sampling frequency with the Nyquist frequency of the signal. The Nyquist frequency is twice the highest frequency present in the signal.

The given signal is:
\[ x(t) = \cos(1000 \pi t) \]

The angular frequency \(\omega\) of the cosine function is given by:
\[ \omega = 1000 \pi \]

The frequency \(f\) in hertz is:
\[ f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{1000 \pi}{2\pi} = 500 \text{ Hz} \]

The Nyquist frequency is twice the signal frequency:
\[ f_{\text{Nyquist}} = 2 \times 500 \text{ Hz} = 1000 \text{ Hz} \]

The sampling frequency given is:
\[ f_s = 700 \text{ Hz} \]

For aliasing to be avoided, the sampling frequency must be at least the Nyquist frequency:
\[ f_s \geq f_{\text{Nyquist}} \]

In this case:
\[ 700 \text{ Hz} < 1000 \text{ Hz} \]

Since the sampling frequency is less than the Nyquist frequency, aliasing will occur.

42,,Does $p(x) = x^5 + x − 1$ have any real roots?,True,"To determine if the polynomial \( p(x) = x^5 + x - 1 \) has any real roots, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, then it has at least one root in that interval.

1. Evaluate \( p(x) \) at some points to check for a sign change:
   - Calculate \( p(0) \):
     \[
     p(0) = 0^5 + 0 - 1 = -1
     \]
   - Calculate \( p(1) \):
     \[
     p(1) = 1^5 + 1 - 1 = 1
     \]

2. Since \( p(0) = -1 \) and \( p(1) = 1 \), the function changes sign between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).

3. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, because \( p(x) \) is continuous (as it is a polynomial) and changes sign between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), there must be at least one real root in the interval \( (0, 1) \).

Therefore, the polynomial \( p(x) = x^5 + x - 1 \) does have at least one real root.

43,,"Find integer $n \ge 1$, such that $n \cdot 2^{n+1}+1$ is a perfect square.",3,15,False,,,
44,,Does cos(x) = x^k have a solution for k = 2023?,True,"To determine if the equation \(\cos(x) = x^{2023}\) has a solution, we need to analyze the behavior of both sides of the equation.

1. **Behavior of \(\cos(x)\):**
   - The function \(\cos(x)\) oscillates between -1 and 1 for all real \(x\).

2. **Behavior of \(x^{2023}\):**
   - Since 2023 is an odd integer, \(x^{2023}\) is an odd function.
   - As \(x \to 0\), \(x^{2023} \to 0\).
   - As \(x \to \infty\), \(x^{2023} \to \infty\).
   - As \(x \to -\infty\), \(x^{2023} \to -\infty\).

3. **Existence of a Solution:**
   - At \(x = 0\), \(\cos(0) = 1\) and \(0^{2023} = 0\). So, they are not equal at \(x = 0\).
   - For small positive \(x\), \(\cos(x) \approx 1\) and \(x^{2023}\) is a very small positive number. As \(x\) increases, \(\cos(x)\) decreases and \(x^{2023}\) increases.
   - For small negative \(x\), \(\cos(x) \approx 1\) and \(x^{2023}\) is a very small negative number. As \(x\) becomes more negative, \(\cos(x)\) decreases and \(x^{2023}\) becomes more negative.

4. **Intermediate Value Theorem:**
   - Consider the interval \([-1, 1]\). At \(x = 0\), \(\cos(0) = 1\) and \(0^{2023} = 0\).
   - At \(x = 1\), \(\cos(1) < 1\) and \(1^{2023} = 1\).
   - At \(x = -1\), \(\cos(-1) < 1\) and \((-1)^{2023} = -1\).

   Since \(\cos(x)\) is continuous and \(x^{2023}\) is continuous, and \(\cos(x)\) takes values from 1 to -1 while \(x^{2023}\) takes values from 0 to 1 (for positive \(x\)) and 0 to -1 (for negative \(x\)), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some \(x\) in \([-1, 1]\) where \(\cos(x) = x^{2023}\).

Therefore, the equation \(\cos(x) = x^{2023}\) does have a solution.

1. **Signal Analysis**:
   - The term \( (1 - e^{-|t|}) \) is an even function because \( e^{-|t|} \) is even.
   - The term \( [u(t+1) - u(t-1)] \) is a rectangular window function that is non-zero only in the interval \(-1 < t < 1\).

2. **Overall Signal**:
   - The product \( x(t) = (1 - e^{-|t|})[u(t+1) - u(t-1)] \) is non-zero only in the interval \(-1 < t < 1\).
   - Within this interval, \( x(t) = 1 - e^{-|t|} \), which is an even function.

3. **Fourier Transform of an Even Function**:
   - The Fourier transform of a real and even function is real and even. This is a property of the Fourier transform.

Since \( x(t) \) is real and even, its Fourier transform will also be real.

Therefore, the Fourier transform of the signal \( x(t) \) is real.

90,,"Let f be a real function on [0,1]. If the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0), then: (a) f is increasing on [0,1]; (b) f is decreasing on [0,1]; (c) None of the above. Which one is correct?",a,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of bounded variation. A function \( f \) on an interval \([a, b]\) is said to have bounded variation if the total variation of \( f \) on \([a, b]\) is finite. The total variation \( V_a^b(f) \) of \( f \) on \([a, b]\) is defined as:

\[
V_a^b(f) = \sup \sum_{i=1}^{n} |f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})|
\]

where the supremum is taken over all partitions \( a = x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n = b \).

In this problem, we are given that the bounded variation of \( f \) on \([0, 1]\) equals \( f(1) - f(0) \). This implies:

\[
V_0^1(f) = f(1) - f(0)
\]

For a function \( f \) to have its total variation equal to \( f(1) - f(0) \), it must be a monotonic function. This is because if \( f \) is not monotonic, there would be additional variation due to the function increasing and decreasing, which would add to the total variation, making it greater than \( f(1) - f(0) \).

Now, let's consider the two types of monotonic functions:

1. **Increasing function**: If \( f \) is increasing on \([0, 1]\), then \( f(x_i) \geq f(x_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \), and the total variation is exactly \( f(1) - f(0) \).

2. **Decreasing function**: If \( f \) is decreasing on \([0, 1]\), then \( f(x_i) \leq f(x_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \), and the total variation is also exactly \( f(0) - f(1) \), which is negative unless \( f(0) = f(1) \).

Since the problem states that the total variation equals \( f(1) - f(0) \), this matches the case where \( f \) is increasing. If \( f \) were decreasing, the total variation would be \( f(0) - f(1) \), which is not the case here unless \( f(0) = f(1) \), which would make the function constant and trivially increasing.

Therefore, the correct choice is:

(a) \( f \) is increasing on \([0, 1]\).",True,,,

(a) $2\theta$. (b) $2\theta^2$. (c) $0.5\theta^{-1}$. (d) $0.5\theta^{-2}$. Which option is correct?",b,"To find the Cramer-Rao lower bound for an unbiased estimator of \(\theta\) in the Gaussian distribution family \(f_\theta(x) = N(0, \theta)\), we need to calculate the Fisher Information \(I(\theta)\) and then use it to find the bound.

The probability density function for a Gaussian distribution \(N(0, \theta)\) is given by:
\[
f(x; \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\theta}} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2\theta}\right)
\]

The log-likelihood function is:
\[
\log f(x; \theta) = -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi\theta) - \frac{x^2}{2\theta}
\]

The derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f(x; \theta) = -\frac{1}{2\theta} + \frac{x^2}{2\theta^2}

The Fisher Information \(I(\theta)\) is the expected value of the negative second derivative of the log-likelihood:
\[
I(\theta) = -E\left[\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} \log f(x; \theta)\right]
\]

First, compute the second derivative:
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} \log f(x; \theta) = \frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{x^2}{\theta^3}
\]

The expected value of the second derivative is:
\[
E\left[\frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{x^2}{\theta^3}\right] = \frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{1}{\theta^3} E[x^2]
\]

Since \(x \sim N(0, \theta)\), we have \(E[x^2] = \theta\). Therefore:
\[
E\left[\frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{x^2}{\theta^3}\right] = \frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{\theta}{\theta^3} = \frac{1}{2\theta^2} - \frac{1}{\theta^2} = -\frac{1}{2\theta^2}
\]

Thus, the Fisher Information is:
\[
I(\theta) = -\left(-\frac{1}{2\theta^2}\right) = \frac{1}{2\theta^2}
\]

The Cramer-Rao lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator is given by:
\[
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}(X)) \geq \frac{1}{I(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2\theta^2}} = 2\theta^2

(a) $\theta$. (b) $\theta^2$. (c) $\theta^{-1}$.

The probability density function is given by:
\[ f_\theta(x) = \theta e^{-\theta x}, \quad x \geq 0. \]

The Fisher information \( I(\theta) \) is defined as:
\[ I(\theta) = E_\theta \left[ \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(X) \right)^2 \right]. \]

First, compute the log-likelihood:
\[ \log f_\theta(x) = \log \theta - \theta x. \]

Differentiate with respect to \(\theta\):
\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log f_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{\theta} - x. \]

Now, compute the Fisher information:
\[ I(\theta) = E_\theta \left[ \left( \frac{1}{\theta} - X \right)^2 \right]. \]

Expand the square:
\[ I(\theta) = E_\theta \left[ \left( \frac{1}{\theta^2} - \frac{2X}{\theta} + X^2 \right) \right]. \]

Since \(X\) follows an exponential distribution with parameter \(\theta\), we have:
- \(E_\theta[X] = \frac{1}{\theta}\),
- \(E_\theta[X^2] = \frac{2}{\theta^2}\).

Substitute these into the expression for \(I(\theta)\):
\[ I(\theta) = \frac{1}{\theta^2} - \frac{2}{\theta^2} + \frac{2}{\theta^2} = \frac{1}{\theta^2}. \]

The Cramer-Rao lower bound for the variance of any unbiased estimator \(\hat{\theta}(X)\) of \(\theta\) is given by:
\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}(X)) \geq \frac{1}{I(\theta)} = \theta^2. \]

Thus, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is \(\theta^2\).

118,,Define f: R 	o R by f(x) = (x^3) / (1 + x^2). Is f uniformly continuous on R?,True,"No.

To determine whether the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^3}{1 + x^2} \) is uniformly continuous on \( \mathbb{R} \), we need to consider the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity and whether the function satisfies the definition of uniform continuity.

A function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is uniformly continuous on \( \mathbb{R} \) if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \), if \( |x - y| < \delta \), then \( |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon \).

Let's analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \):

1. As \( x \to \infty \), the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^3}{1 + x^2} \) behaves like \( x \) because the highest power of \( x \) in the numerator dominates. Specifically, \( f(x) \approx x \).

2. Similarly, as \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \approx x \).

The function \( f(x) \) is not bounded as \( x \to \pm \infty \), and it behaves like a linear function with a slope of 1. Linear functions with non-zero slopes are not uniformly continuous on unbounded intervals because the difference \( |f(x) - f(y)| \) can become arbitrarily large as \( x \) and \( y \) become large, even if \( |x - y| \) is small.

Therefore, \( f(x) = \frac{x^3}{1 + x^2} \) is not uniformly continuous on \( \mathbb{R} \). The answer is no.",False,,,
