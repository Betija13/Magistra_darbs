\[ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 G m_E}{R_E}} \]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2 \),
- \( m_E \) is the mass of the Earth, \( m_E = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( R_E \) is the radius of the Earth, \( R_E = 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \).

Plugging in the values:

\[ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24}}{6.38 \times 10^6}} \]

\[ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{7.972 \times 10^{14}}{6.38 \times 10^6}} \]

\[ v_e = \sqrt{1.249 \times 10^8} \]

\[ v_e \approx 11180 \, \text{m/s} \]

Since the problem asks for the unit in \( 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \), we convert:

At retirement she wants to withdraw money as an annuity that pays a constant amount every month for 25 years. During the savings phase, the retirement account earns 6% interest compounded quarterly. During the annuity payout phase, the retirement account earns 4.8% interest compounded monthly. Calculate Aisha’s monthly retirement annuity payout.",1898.27,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate two main parts: the future value of Aisha's savings at the end of 30 years, and then the monthly annuity payout she can receive for 25 years.

1. **Calculate the future value of the savings:**

   Aisha saves $1000 each quarter for 30 years. The interest rate is 6% compounded quarterly.

   - Quarterly interest rate = 6% / 4 = 1.5% = 0.015
   - Number of quarters in 30 years = 30 * 4 = 120

   The future value of an ordinary annuity formula is:
   \[
   FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
   \]
   where \( P = 1000 \), \( r = 0.015 \), and \( n = 120 \).

   \[
   FV = 1000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.015)^{120} - 1}{0.015}
   \]

   \[
   FV = 1000 \times \frac{(1.015)^{120} - 1}{0.015}
   \]

   \[
   FV = 1000 \times \frac{4.454 - 1}{0.015}
   \]

   \[
   FV = 1000 \times \frac{3.454}{0.015}
   \]

   \[
   FV = 1000 \times 230.267
   \]

   \[
   FV = 230,267
   \]

2. **Calculate the monthly annuity payout:**

   Now, Aisha wants to withdraw this amount as an annuity over 25 years with an interest rate of 4.8% compounded monthly.

   - Monthly interest rate = 4.8% / 12 = 0.4% = 0.004
   - Number of months in 25 years = 25 * 12 = 300

   The formula for the monthly annuity payout is:
   \[
   PMT = \frac{FV \times r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
   \]
   where \( FV = 230,267 \), \( r = 0.004 \), and \( n = 300 \).

   \[
   PMT = \frac{230,267 \times 0.004}{1 - (1 + 0.004)^{-300}}
   \]

   \[
   PMT = \frac{921.068}{1 - (1.004)^{-300}}
   \]

   \[
   PMT = \frac{921.068}{1 - 0.301}
   \]

   \[
   PMT = \frac{921.068}{0.699}
   \]

   \[
   PMT = 1,317.77
   \]

Therefore, Aisha’s monthly retirement annuity payout is approximately:

Return the numeric value.",345.0,"The terminal velocity \( v_t \) is achieved when the drag force equals the gravitational force. The gravitational force \( F_g \) is given by:

\[ F_g = mg \]

where \( m = 80 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

The drag force at terminal velocity is:

\[ F_D = kv_t^2 \]

At terminal velocity, \( F_g = F_D \), so:

\[ mg = kv_t^2 \]

Solving for \( v_t \):

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{k}} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{80 \times 9.81}{0.27}} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{\frac{784.8}{0.27}} \]

\[ v_t = \sqrt{2907.4074} \]

\[ v_t \approx 53.92 \, \text{m/s} \]

We need to find the distance \( h \) traveled until the velocity \( v = 0.95v_t \).

\[ v = 0.95 \times 53.92 \]

\[ v \approx 51.224 \, \text{m/s} \]

The velocity as a function of time \( v(t) \) for an object in free fall with drag is given by:

\[ v(t) = v_t \tanh\left(\frac{gt}{v_t}\right) \]

We set \( v(t) = 0.95v_t \):

\[ 0.95v_t = v_t \tanh\left(\frac{gt}{v_t}\right) \]

\[ 0.95 = \tanh\left(\frac{gt}{v_t}\right) \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ \tanh^{-1}(0.95) = \frac{gt}{v_t} \]

\[ t = \frac{v_t}{g} \tanh^{-1}(0.95) \]

Calculate \( \tanh^{-1}(0.95) \):

\[ \tanh^{-1}(0.95) \approx 1.8318 \]

Substitute the values:

\[ t = \frac{53.92}{9.81} \times 1.8318 \]

\[ t \approx 10.065 \, \text{s} \]

The distance \( h \) traveled in time \( t \) is given by:

\[ h = \int_0^t v(t) \, dt \]

\[ h = \int_0^t v_t \tanh\left(\frac{gt}{v_t}\right) \, dt \]

The integral of \( v(t) \) is:

\[ h = v_t \left( \frac{v_t}{g} \ln\left(\cosh\left(\frac{gt}{v_t}\right)\right) \right) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ h = 53.92 \times \frac{53.92}{9.81} \ln\left(\cosh\left(\frac{9.81 \times 10.065}{53.92}\right)\right) \]

\[ h = 53.92 \times 5.4954 \ln\left(\cosh(1.8318)\right) \]

\[ h = 296.25 \ln(1.95) \]

\[ h \approx 296.25 \times 0.6678 \]

\[ h \approx 197.8 \]

\[
n \cdot 2^{n+1} + 1 = m^2
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
n \cdot 2^{n+1} = m^2 - 1 = (m-1)(m+1)
\]

Since \( n \cdot 2^{n+1} \) is even, both \( m-1 \) and \( m+1 \) must be even, implying \( m \) is odd. Let \( m = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:

\[
m-1 = 2k \quad \text{and} \quad m+1 = 2k + 2
\]

Thus:

\[
(m-1)(m+1) = 2k(2k+2) = 4k(k+1)
\]

Equating this to \( n \cdot 2^{n+1} \), we have:

\[
n \cdot 2^{n+1} = 4k(k+1)
\]

Dividing both sides by 4:

\[
n \cdot 2^n = k(k+1)

We need to find \( n \) such that this equation holds for some integer \( k \). Let's test small values of \( n \):

This means we need to calculate:

\[

48,,Sum the series $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{m^2 n}{3^m(n3^m+m3^n)}$,0.28125,"To solve the given series, we need to evaluate the double sum:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)}
\]

First, let's consider the inner sum:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{n3^{2m} + m^2 3^n}
\]

Now, let's analyze the behavior of the terms in the sum. For large \( n \), the term \( m^2 3^n \) dominates \( n3^{2m} \), and for large \( m \), the term \( n3^{2m} \) dominates \( m^2 3^n \). This suggests that the series might converge due to the exponential growth in the denominators.

To simplify, let's consider the case when \( m = n \):

\[
\frac{m^2 m}{m3^{2m} + m^2 3^m} = \frac{m^3}{m3^{2m} + m^2 3^m} = \frac{m^2}{3^{2m} + m 3^m}
\]

For large \( m \), the term \( 3^{2m} \) dominates, so:

\[
\frac{m^2}{3^{2m} + m 3^m} \approx \frac{m^2}{3^{2m}}
\]

This suggests that the series converges. Now, let's consider the entire double sum:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)}
\]

By symmetry and the nature of the terms, we can interchange the order of summation:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)}
\]

This is equivalent to the original sum due to the symmetry in \( m \) and \( n \). Therefore, the sum can be simplified by considering the symmetry and convergence properties.

After evaluating the convergence and symmetry, the sum evaluates to:

What is k?,1,"The large integer \( N \) is formed by writing the two-digit integers from 19 to 92 consecutively. We need to determine the highest power of 3, \( 3^k \), that divides \( N \).

First, we count the number of digits in \( N \). The two-digit numbers from 19 to 92 are:

- From 19 to 99, there are \( 99 - 19 + 1 = 81 \) numbers.
- However, we only go up to 92, so we have \( 92 - 19 + 1 = 74 \) numbers.

Each of these numbers has 2 digits, so the total number of digits in \( N \) is \( 74 \times 2 = 148 \).

Next, we need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \) because the divisibility by 3 depends on the sum of the digits.

The sum of the digits of each number from 19 to 92 can be calculated as follows:

- The tens digit ranges from 1 to 9.
- The units digit ranges from 0 to 9, but we start from 9 and end at 2.

Let's calculate the sum of the digits for each tens digit:

- For tens digit 1 (19): \( 1 + 9 = 10 \)
- For tens digit 2 (20 to 29): \( 2 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 20 + 45 = 65 \)
- For tens digit 3 (30 to 39): \( 3 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 30 + 45 = 75 \)
- For tens digit 4 (40 to 49): \( 4 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 40 + 45 = 85 \)
- For tens digit 5 (50 to 59): \( 5 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 50 + 45 = 95 \)
- For tens digit 6 (60 to 69): \( 6 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 60 + 45 = 105 \)
- For tens digit 7 (70 to 79): \( 7 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 70 + 45 = 115 \)
- For tens digit 8 (80 to 89): \( 8 \times 10 + (0 + 1 + \ldots + 9) = 80 + 45 = 125 \)
- For tens digit 9 (90 to 92): \( 9 \times 3 + (0 + 1 + 2) = 27 + 3 = 30 \)

Now, sum these results:

\[
10 + 65 + 75 + 85 + 95 + 105 + 115 + 125 + 30 = 705
\]

The sum of the digits of \( N \) is 705. We need to find the highest power of 3 that divides 705.

First, check divisibility by 3:

- \( 705 \div 3 = 235 \)

Next, check divisibility of 235 by 3:

- \( 235 \div 3 \approx 78.333 \) (not divisible)

Thus, 705 is divisible by \( 3^1 \) but not by \( 3^2 \).

Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides \( N \) is \( 3^1 \).

80,,Calculate the momentum uncertainty of a tennis ball constrained to be in a fence enclosure of length 35 m surrounding the court in kg m/s.,3e-36,"To calculate the momentum uncertainty of a tennis ball constrained to be in a fence enclosure, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta x\) is the uncertainty in position,
- \(\Delta p\) is the uncertainty in momentum,
- \(h\) is Planck's constant, approximately \(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{m}^2 \text{kg/s}\).

Given that the length of the fence enclosure is 35 m, we can assume that the uncertainty in position \(\Delta x\) is 35 m.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\Delta p\):

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta x}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4\pi \times 35}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4 \times 3.1416 \times 35}
\]

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{439.8224}

\[
\Delta p \geq 1.506 \times 10^{-36} \, \text{kg m/s}

\[
\iint_V \frac{d x \, d y \, d z}{(1+x+y+z)^3}
\]

where \( V = \{(x, y, z) : x, y, z \geq 0, x+y+z \leq 1\} \).

This region \( V \) is a tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the planes \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), \( z = 0 \), and \( x+y+z = 1 \).

To solve this, we can use a change of variables. Let:

\[
u = x, \quad v = x + y, \quad w = x + y + z
\]

The Jacobian of this transformation is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
\end{vmatrix}
=
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
= 1
\]

Thus, the Jacobian is 1, and the volume element \( dx \, dy \, dz = du \, dv \, dw \).

The region \( V \) in the new variables is:

\[
0 \leq u \leq v \leq w \leq 1
\]

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^w \int_0^v \frac{du \, dv \, dw}{(1+w)^3}
\]

The integral over \( u \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^v du = v
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^w \frac{v \, dv \, dw}{(1+w)^3}
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \( v \):

\[
\int_0^w v \, dv = \left[ \frac{v^2}{2} \right]_0^w = \frac{w^2}{2}
\]

The integral now is:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{w^2}{2(1+w)^3} \, dw
\]

To solve this, use the substitution \( t = 1 + w \), \( dt = dw \), and when \( w = 0 \), \( t = 1 \); when \( w = 1 \), \( t = 2 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^2 \frac{(t-1)^2}{2t^3} \, dt
\]

Expanding \( (t-1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_1^2 \left( \frac{t^2}{t^3} - \frac{2t}{t^3} + \frac{1}{t^3} \right) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_1^2 \left( \frac{1}{t} - \frac{2}{t^2} + \frac{1}{t^3} \right) \, dt
\]

This can be integrated term by term:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \left[ \ln t \right]_1^2 - 2 \left[ -\frac{1}{t} \right]_1^2 + \left[ -\frac{1}{2t^2} \right]_1^2 \right)
\]

Calculating each term:

- \(\left[ \ln t \right]_1^2 = \ln 2 - \ln 1 = \ln 2\)
- \(-2 \left[ -\frac{1}{t} \right]_1^2 = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{2} + 1 \right) = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1\)
- \(\left[ -\frac{1}{2t^2} \right]_1^2 = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8}\)

Thus, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \ln 2 + 1 + \frac{3}{8} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln 2 + \frac{11}{8} \right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln 2}{2} + \frac{11}{16}

However, the integral simplifies to a known result for this type of problem, which is:

Therefore, the solution to the integral is:

Unpolarized light passes through a polarizer. It then passes through another polarizer at angle 40 degree to the first, and then another at angle 15 degree to the second. What percentage of the original intensity was the light coming out of the second polarizer?",54.8,"To solve this problem, we need to apply Malus' law twice, as the light passes through two polarizers after the initial one.

1. **First Polarizer:**
   - Unpolarized light passing through a polarizer reduces its intensity to half. So, after the first polarizer, the intensity \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \).

2. **Second Polarizer:**
   - The angle between the first and second polarizer is 40 degrees.
   - Using Malus' law: \( I_2 = I_1 \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ) \).
   - Substitute \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \): 
     \[
     I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ)
     \]

3. **Third Polarizer:**
   - The angle between the second and third polarizer is 15 degrees.
   - Using Malus' law again: \( I_3 = I_2 \cdot \cos^2(15^\circ) \).
   - Substitute \( I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ) \):
     \[
     I_3 = \left(\frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ)\right) \cdot \cos^2(15^\circ)
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the original intensity:**
   - The percentage of the original intensity \( I_0 \) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{I_3}{I_0}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Substitute \( I_3 \):
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ) \cdot \cos^2(15^\circ)}{I_0}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \cos^2(40^\circ) \cdot \cos^2(15^\circ)\right) \times 100\%
     \]

5. **Calculate the cosine values:**
   - \( \cos(40^\circ) \approx 0.7660 \)
   - \( \cos^2(40^\circ) \approx 0.7660^2 = 0.5868 \)
   - \( \cos(15^\circ) \approx 0.9659 \)
   - \( \cos^2(15^\circ) \approx 0.9659^2 = 0.9330 \)

6. **Final calculation:**
   - Substitute the cosine squared values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.5868 \cdot 0.9330\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(0.5 \cdot 0.5868 \cdot 0.9330\right) \times 100\%
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.2740 \times 100\%
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 27.40\%

96,,Consider a file with a size of 350 Kbytes storing in a web server. Client A sends a request to the server to retrieve the file from a remote location. It is known that the link capacity between client A and the server is 10 Mbps and the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is fixed at 20ms. Assume that the segment size is 20 Kbytes and the client has a receiver buffer of 200Kbytes. Assume that the window size (W) is adjusted according to the congestion control procedures of TCP-Reno. How long (in ms) does client A take to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request? Given that the initial slow-start threshold is 32.,344,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for client A to receive the entire 350 Kbytes file from the server using TCP-Reno congestion control. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Convert Units:**
   - File size: 350 Kbytes = 350 * 8 = 2800 Kbits
   - Link capacity: 10 Mbps = 10,000 Kbps
   - RTT: 20 ms

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Segment size: 20 Kbytes = 160 Kbits
   - Receiver buffer: 200 Kbytes = 1600 Kbits
   - Initial slow-start threshold (ssthresh): 32 segments

3. **TCP-Reno Congestion Control:**
   - TCP-Reno starts with a congestion window (cwnd) of 1 segment (20 Kbytes).
   - In slow start, cwnd doubles every RTT until it reaches ssthresh or the receiver buffer limit.
   - After reaching ssthresh, TCP enters congestion avoidance, increasing cwnd by 1 segment per RTT.

4. **Calculate Time to Transfer the File:**
   - **Slow Start Phase:**
     - RTT 1: cwnd = 1 segment = 20 Kbytes
     - RTT 2: cwnd = 2 segments = 40 Kbytes
     - RTT 3: cwnd = 4 segments = 80 Kbytes
     - RTT 4: cwnd = 8 segments = 160 Kbytes
     - RTT 5: cwnd = 16 segments = 320 Kbytes
     - RTT 6: cwnd = 32 segments = 640 Kbytes (ssthresh reached)

   - **Congestion Avoidance Phase:**
     - At the end of RTT 6, 320 Kbytes have been sent.
     - Remaining data: 350 Kbytes - 320 Kbytes = 30 Kbytes
     - RTT 7: cwnd = 33 segments = 660 Kbytes (more than enough to send remaining 30 Kbytes)

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total RTTs = 7
   - Total time = 7 RTTs * 20 ms/RTT = 140 ms

Therefore, the time it takes for client A to receive the whole file is 140 ms.

\[ I = I_s \left( e^{\frac{qV}{kT}} - 1 \right) \]

where:
- \( I \) is the current through the diode,
- \( I_s \) is the reverse saturation current,
- \( q \) is the charge of an electron (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)),
- \( V \) is the voltage across the diode,
- \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

For forward-bias current (\( I_f \)):
\[ I_f = I_s \left( e^{\frac{q \times 1.5}{k \times 293}} - 1 \right) \]

For reverse-bias current (\( I_r \)):
\[ I_r = I_s \left( e^{\frac{-q \times 1.5}{k \times 293}} - 1 \right) \]

The ratio of forward-bias to reverse-bias currents is:
\[ \frac{I_f}{I_r} = \frac{e^{\frac{q \times 1.5}{k \times 293}} - 1}{e^{\frac{-q \times 1.5}{k \times 293}} - 1} \]

Calculating the exponent:
\[ \frac{q \times 1.5}{k \times 293} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 1.5}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 293} \approx 59.81 \]

Thus:
\[ e^{59.81} \] is a very large number, and \[ e^{-59.81} \] is a very small number.

Therefore, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

First, we find the derivatives:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 1
\]

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t
\]

\[
\frac{dz}{dt} = 2t^2
\]

Substitute these into the arc length formula:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1^2 + (2t)^2 + (2t^2)^2} \, dt
\]

Simplify the expression under the square root:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4t^4} \, dt
\]

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{4t^4 + 4t^2 + 1} \, dt
\]

Notice that \( 4t^4 + 4t^2 + 1 = (2t^2 + 1)^2 \), so:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{(2t^2 + 1)^2} \, dt
\]

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} |2t^2 + 1| \, dt
\]

Since \( 2t^2 + 1 \) is always positive for all real \( t \), we have:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} (2t^2 + 1) \, dt
\]

Now, integrate:

\[
L = \int_{a}^{b} (2t^2 + 1) \, dt = \left[ \frac{2t^3}{3} + t \right]_{a}^{b}
\]

Assuming the interval is from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) (a common choice for such problems unless specified otherwise), we evaluate:

\[
L = \left[ \frac{2(1)^3}{3} + 1 \right] - \left[ \frac{2(0)^3}{3} + 0 \right]
\]

\[
L = \left[ \frac{2}{3} + 1 \right] - 0
\]

\[
L = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{5}{3}

Thus, the arc length of the curve from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) is:

The bulk modulus of the oil is $B=5.0 \times 10^9 Pa$ (about $5.0 \times 10^4 atm$) and its compressibility is $k=1 / B=20 \times 10^{-6} atm^{-1}$. (Unit: 10^{-4} m^3),-0.8,"The decrease in volume of the oil can be calculated using the formula for compressibility:

\[
\Delta V = -V \cdot k \cdot \Delta p
\]

where:
- \( V = 0.25 \, m^3 \) is the initial volume of the oil,
- \( k = \frac{1}{B} = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, atm^{-1} \) is the compressibility,
- \( \Delta p = 1.6 \times 10^7 \, Pa \) is the pressure increase.

First, we need to convert the compressibility from \( atm^{-1} \) to \( Pa^{-1} \). Since \( 1 \, atm = 1.013 \times 10^5 \, Pa \), we have:

\[
k = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, atm^{-1} = 20 \times 10^{-6} \times \frac{1}{1.013 \times 10^5} \, Pa^{-1}
\]

\[
k = \frac{20 \times 10^{-6}}{1.013 \times 10^5} \, Pa^{-1} \approx 1.974 \times 10^{-10} \, Pa^{-1}

Now, calculate the decrease in volume:

\[
\Delta V = -0.25 \, m^3 \times 1.974 \times 10^{-10} \, Pa^{-1} \times 1.6 \times 10^7 \, Pa

\[
\kappa = \frac{|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)|}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

First, we find the first derivative \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\):

\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}[5\cos(t)\mathbf{i} + 4\sin(t)\mathbf{j} + 3t\mathbf{k}] = -5\sin(t)\mathbf{i} + 4\cos(t)\mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}
\]

Next, we find the second derivative \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\):

\[
\mathbf{r}''(t) = \frac{d}{dt}[-5\sin(t)\mathbf{i} + 4\cos(t)\mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}] = -5\cos(t)\mathbf{i} - 4\sin(t)\mathbf{j}
\]

Now, we calculate the cross product \(\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\):

\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
-5\sin(t) & 4\cos(t) & 3 \\
-5\cos(t) & -4\sin(t) & 0

\]

Calculating the determinant, we have:

\[
= \mathbf{i}(4\cos(t) \cdot 0 - 3(-4\sin(t))) - \mathbf{j}(-5\sin(t) \cdot 0 - 3(-5\cos(t))) + \mathbf{k}(-5\sin(t)(-4\sin(t)) - 4\cos(t)(-5\cos(t)))

\[
= \mathbf{i}(12\sin(t)) + \mathbf{j}(15\cos(t)) + \mathbf{k}(20\sin^2(t) + 20\cos^2(t))
\]

\[
= 12\sin(t)\mathbf{i} + 15\cos(t)\mathbf{j} + 20\mathbf{k}
\]

The magnitude of the cross product is:

\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)| = \sqrt{(12\sin(t))^2 + (15\cos(t))^2 + 20^2}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{144\sin^2(t) + 225\cos^2(t) + 400}
\]

Now, we calculate \(|\mathbf{r}'(t)|\):

\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{(-5\sin(t))^2 + (4\cos(t))^2 + 3^2}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{25\sin^2(t) + 16\cos^2(t) + 9}
\]

At \(t = \frac{4\pi}{3}\), \(\sin(t) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\cos(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\).

Substitute these values:

\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{25\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 16\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 9}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{25 \cdot \frac{3}{4} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 9}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{\frac{75}{4} + \frac{16}{4} + 9}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{\frac{91}{4} + 9} = \sqrt{\frac{91}{4} + \frac{36}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{127}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{127}}{2}

Now, calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)| = \sqrt{144\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 225\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 400}

\[
= \sqrt{144 \cdot \frac{3}{4} + 225 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 400}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{108 + 56.25 + 400} = \sqrt{564.25}
\]

Finally, the curvature \(\kappa\) is:

\[
\kappa = \frac{\sqrt{564.25}}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{127}}{2}\right)^3}
\]

\[
= \frac{\sqrt{564.25}}{\frac{127\sqrt{127}}{8}}
\]

\[
= \frac{8\sqrt{564.25}}{127\sqrt{127}}

First, consider the complex function \( f(z) = \frac{1}{(z^2 + 1)^2} \). The poles of this function are the solutions to \( z^2 + 1 = 0 \), which are \( z = i \) and \( z = -i \).

Both poles are simple poles, but since we are dealing with \( (z^2 + 1)^2 \), they are actually poles of order 2.

To evaluate the integral, we consider a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane with radius \( R \) and let \( R \to \infty \). The contour integral over this path is given by:

\[
\oint_C f(z) \, dz = \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{1}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \, dx + \int_{\text{arc}} \frac{1}{(z^2 + 1)^2} \, dz
\]

As \( R \to \infty \), the integral over the arc vanishes. Thus, the integral over the real line is equal to \( 2\pi i \) times the sum of the residues of \( f(z) \) inside the contour.

The residue of \( f(z) \) at \( z = i \) is calculated as follows. For a pole of order 2, the residue is given by:

\[
\text{Res}(f, i) = \lim_{z \to i} \frac{d}{dz} \left( (z - i)^2 f(z) \right)
\]

First, compute:

\[
(z - i)^2 f(z) = \frac{1}{(z + i)^2}
\]

Differentiate:

\[
\frac{d}{dz} \left( \frac{1}{(z + i)^2} \right) = \frac{d}{dz} \left( (z + i)^{-2} \right) = -2(z + i)^{-3}
\]

Evaluate at \( z = i \):

\[
\text{Res}(f, i) = -2(i + i)^{-3} = -2(2i)^{-3} = -2 \cdot \frac{1}{-8i} = \frac{1}{4i}
\]

Thus, the integral is:

\[
I = 2\pi i \cdot \frac{1}{4i} = \frac{\pi}{2}

Determine how many ms client A takes to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request.",918,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Client A to receive the entire 900 Kbytes file using TCP Reno, considering the given network conditions.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - File size = 900 Kbytes
   - Segment size = 15 Kbytes
   - Transmission rate = 10 Mbps
   - RTT = 30 ms
   - Slow-start threshold = 8 segments
   - Client's buffer = 150 Kbytes

2. **TCP Reno Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance:**
   - TCP Reno starts with a congestion window (cwnd) of 1 segment (15 Kbytes).
   - The cwnd doubles every RTT until it reaches the slow-start threshold (8 segments).
   - After reaching the threshold, TCP enters congestion avoidance, increasing cwnd by 1 segment per RTT.

3. **Calculate the number of RTTs needed:**
   - **Slow Start Phase:**
     - RTT 1: cwnd = 1 segment
     - RTT 2: cwnd = 2 segments
     - RTT 3: cwnd = 4 segments
     - RTT 4: cwnd = 8 segments (reaches slow-start threshold)

   - **Congestion Avoidance Phase:**
     - From RTT 5 onwards, cwnd increases linearly by 1 segment per RTT.

4. **Determine the number of segments:**
   - Total file size = 900 Kbytes
   - Number of segments = 900 Kbytes / 15 Kbytes per segment = 60 segments

5. **Calculate the time to send all segments:**
   - **Slow Start Phase:**
     - Segments sent in 4 RTTs = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 segments

   - **Congestion Avoidance Phase:**
     - Remaining segments = 60 - 15 = 45 segments

   - Rearrange to express wage as a function of labor: \( w = \frac{l}{80} \)

2. **Marginal Cost of Labor (MCL)**: 
   - The MCL is the derivative of the total cost of labor with respect to labor. 
   - Total cost of labor: \( C(l) = w \cdot l = \frac{l}{80} \cdot l = \frac{l^2}{80} \)
   - MCL is the derivative of \( C(l) \): \( MCL = \frac{d}{dl} \left(\frac{l^2}{80}\right) = \frac{2l}{80} = \frac{l}{40} \)

The gun is placed close to a straight, horizontal railway line and aligned such that the projectile will land further down the line. A small rail car of mass 200 kg and travelling at a speed of 100 m/s passes the gun just as it is fired. Assuming the gun and the car are at the same level, at what angle upwards must the projectile be fired so that it lands in the rail car?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle at which the projectile should be fired so that it lands in the rail car. This involves analyzing the motion of both the projectile and the rail car.

1. **Projectile Motion:**
   - The projectile is launched with an initial speed \( v_0 = 200 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - The angle of launch is \( \theta \).
   - The horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity are:
     \[
     v_{0x} = v_0 \cos \theta
     \]
     \[
     v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \theta
     \]

2. **Rail Car Motion:**
   - The rail car moves with a constant speed \( v_c = 100 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Time of Flight:**
   - The time of flight \( t \) for the projectile is determined by the vertical motion:
     \[
     y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
     \]
   - Since the projectile lands back at the same level, \( y = 0 \):
     \[
     0 = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \), we get:
     \[
     t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
     \]

4. **Horizontal Range:**
   - The horizontal distance covered by the projectile is:
     \[
     x = v_{0x} \cdot t = v_0 \cos \theta \cdot \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     x = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{g}
     \]
   - Using the identity \( \sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \), we have:
     \[
     x = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
     \]

5. **Distance Covered by Rail Car:**
   - The rail car travels a distance \( d = v_c \cdot t \) in the same time \( t \):
     \[
     d = 100 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 200 \sin \theta}{9.8}
     \]

6. **Equating Distances:**
   - For the projectile to land in the rail car, the horizontal distance \( x \) must equal the distance \( d \) covered by the rail car:
     \[
     \frac{200^2 \sin 2\theta}{9.8} = 100 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 200 \sin \theta}{9.8}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     40000 \sin 2\theta = 40000 \sin \theta
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by 40000:
     \[
     \sin 2\theta = \sin \theta
     \]

7. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Using the identity \( \sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \), we have:
     \[
     2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin \theta
     \]
   - If \( \sin \theta \neq 0 \), divide both sides by \( \sin \theta \):
     \[
     2 \cos \theta = 1
     \]
   - Solving for \( \theta \), we get:
     \[
     \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \theta = 60^\circ \).

Thus, the angle at which the projectile must be fired is \( 60 \) degrees. However, since the problem asks for the angle in radians, we convert \( 60^\circ \) to radians:

\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \, \text{radians}
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

195,,Compute the mean molecular speed v in the heavy gas radon (Rn) in m/s,167.0,"To calculate the mean molecular speed (\(v\)) of a gas, we use the formula derived from the kinetic theory of gases:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{8kT}{\pi m}} \]

where:
- \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( m \) is the mass of one molecule of the gas in kilograms.

For radon (Rn), we need to find the mass of one molecule. The molar mass of radon is approximately 222 g/mol. To convert this to kilograms per molecule, we use:

\[ m = \frac{222 \, \text{g/mol}}{1000 \, \text{g/kg}} \times \frac{1}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}} \]

\[ m = \frac{222}{1000 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}} \]

\[ m \approx 3.69 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg} \]

Assuming room temperature (\(T = 298 \, \text{K}\)), we can now calculate the mean molecular speed:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{8 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 298}{\pi \times 3.69 \times 10^{-25}}} \]

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{3.29 \times 10^{-20}}{1.16 \times 10^{-25}}} \]

\[
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1}
\]

where \( f^{(n+1)}(c) \) is the \((n+1)\)-th derivative of the function evaluated at some point \( c \) in the interval between \( a \) and \( x \).

For \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), the derivatives are:
- \( f'(x) = \cos(x) \)
- \( f''(x) = -\sin(x) \)
- \( f'''(x) = -\cos(x) \)
- \( f^{(4)}(x) = \sin(x) \)
- \( f^{(5)}(x) = \cos(x) \)
- \( f^{(6)}(x) = -\sin(x) \)

The sixth derivative, \( f^{(6)}(x) = -\sin(x) \), is needed for the error term of the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial.

The Taylor polynomial is centered at \( x = 0 \), so \( a = 0 \). We are approximating \( \sin(1) \), so \( x = 1 \).

The error term is:

\[
R_5(1) = \frac{f^{(6)}(c)}{6!} (1-0)^6
\]

Since \( f^{(6)}(x) = -\sin(x) \), the maximum value of \( |f^{(6)}(c)| \) for \( c \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) is 1, because the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1.

Thus, the error bound is:

\[
R_5(1) \leq \frac{1}{6!} \cdot 1^6 = \frac{1}{720}

Therefore, the Lagrange error of the polynomial approximation to \(\sin(1)\) is:

Each question reduces the number of possible candidates for \( X \) by half, on average. After asking \( k \) questions, the expected number of remaining candidates is \( \frac{m}{2^k} \).

In this problem, we ask \( n + \sqrt{n} \) questions. Therefore, the expected number of remaining candidates is:

\[
\frac{m}{2^{n + \sqrt{n}}} = \frac{2^n}{2^{n + \sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\sqrt{n}}}

The probability of error is the probability that more than one candidate remains. By Markov's inequality, the probability that the number of remaining candidates is greater than or equal to 1 is at most the expected number of remaining candidates:

\[

Suppose \alpha=\beta=9/10 and \tau=1/1000. Return the answer up to the thousands decimal.",0.075,"To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that event T occurred given that both Alf and Bob assert that T occurred. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) = \tau = \frac{1}{1000} \)
- \( P(A|T) = \alpha = \frac{9}{10} \)
- \( P(B|T) = \beta = \frac{9}{10} \)

We want to find \( P(T|A \cap B) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|A \cap B) = \frac{P(A \cap B|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(A \cap B)} \]

Since Alf and Bob are independent:
\[ P(A \cap B|T) = P(A|T) \cdot P(B|T) = \alpha \cdot \beta = \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{81}{100} \]

Now, we need to find \( P(A \cap B) \):
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A \cap B|T) \cdot P(T) + P(A \cap B|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Where \( T^c \) is the complement of T, i.e., T did not occur.

Since Alf and Bob are independent:
\[ P(A \cap B|T^c) = P(A|T^c) \cdot P(B|T^c) \]

Given:
\[ P(A|T^c) = 1 - \alpha = \frac{1}{10} \]
\[ P(B|T^c) = 1 - \beta = \frac{1}{10} \]

Thus:
\[ P(A \cap B|T^c) = \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{100} \]

Now, calculate \( P(A \cap B) \):
\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{100} \cdot \frac{999}{1000} \]
\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100000} + \frac{999}{100000} \cdot \frac{1}{100} \]
\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100000} + \frac{999}{1000000} \]
\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{81}{100000} + \frac{99.9}{100000} \]
\[ P(A \cap B) = \frac{180.9}{100000} \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|A \cap B) \):
\[ P(T|A \cap B) = \frac{\frac{81}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{1000}}{\frac{180.9}{100000}} \]
\[ P(T|A \cap B) = \frac{\frac{81}{100000}}{\frac{180.9}{100000}} \]
\[ P(T|A \cap B) = \frac{81}{180.9} \]

Calculate the final result:

The bottom of the ladder rests on a ledge and leans across the moat in equilibrium against a frictionless, vertical castle wall. The ladder makes an angle of with the horizontal. Lancelot pauses onethird of the way up the ladder.  Find the magnitude of the contact force on the base of the ladder. (Unit: N)",1020,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the ladder and apply the principles of static equilibrium. The ladder is in equilibrium, so the sum of the forces and the sum of the torques (moments) must be zero.

1. **Forces acting on the ladder:**
   - Weight of Sir Lancelot: \( W_L = 800 \, \text{N} \)
   - Weight of the ladder: \( W = 180 \, \text{N} \)
   - Normal force at the base of the ladder: \( N \)
   - Frictional force at the base of the ladder: \( f \)
   - Normal force from the wall: \( F_w \)

2. **Position of forces:**
   - Lancelot is one-third of the way up the ladder, so he is at \( \frac{5.0}{3} \, \text{m} \) from the base.
   - The center of mass of the ladder is at its midpoint, \( \frac{5.0}{2} \, \text{m} \) from the base.

3. **Equilibrium conditions:**
   - Sum of vertical forces: \( N = W + W_L \)
   - Sum of horizontal forces: \( f = F_w \)
   - Sum of torques about the base of the ladder (taking counterclockwise as positive):

   \[
   W_L \cdot \frac{5.0}{3} \cdot \cos(\theta) + W \cdot \frac{5.0}{2} \cdot \cos(\theta) = F_w \cdot 5.0 \cdot \sin(\theta)
   \]

   Here, \(\theta\) is the angle the ladder makes with the horizontal. However, since the wall is frictionless, \( f = 0 \), and thus \( F_w = 0 \).

4. **Solving for \( N \):**
   - Since \( F_w = 0 \), the torque equation simplifies, and we only need to consider the vertical forces for \( N \).

   \[
   N = W + W_L = 180 + 800 = 980 \, \text{N}

Therefore, the magnitude of the contact force on the base of the ladder is:

     - Up move: \( S_u = S_0 \times u = 70 \times 1.181 = 82.67 \).
     - Down move: \( S_d = S_0 \times d = 70 \times 0.890 = 62.30 \).

   - After two periods (1 year):
     - Up-Up move: \( S_{uu} = S_u \times u = 82.67 \times 1.181 = 97.60 \).
     - Up-Down move (or Down-Up, since it's the same): \( S_{ud} = S_{du} = S_u \times d = 82.67 \times 0.890 = 73.57 \).
     - Down-Down move: \( S_{dd} = S_d \times d = 62.30 \times 0.890 = 55.45 \).

2. **Calculate the option payoffs at expiration:**

   - Put option payoff is \( \max(K - S, 0) \), where \( K = 80 \).

   - At \( S_{uu} = 97.60 \), payoff = \( \max(80 - 97.60, 0) = 0 \).
   - At \( S_{ud} = 73.57 \), payoff = \( \max(80 - 73.57, 0) = 6.43 \).
   - At \( S_{dd} = 55.45 \), payoff = \( \max(80 - 55.45, 0) = 24.55 \).

3. **Calculate the risk-neutral probabilities:**

   - Risk-free rate \( r = 0.05 \) (continuously compounded), so \( e^{r \Delta t} = e^{0.05 \times 0.5} = 1.02532 \).

   - Risk-neutral probability \( p = \frac{e^{r \Delta t} - d}{u - d} = \frac{1.02532 - 0.890}{1.181 - 0.890} = \frac{0.13532}{0.291} = 0.4651 \).

4. **Calculate the option price at each node:**

   - At node \( S_u \) (after one period):
     - Option value = \( e^{-r \Delta t} \times (p \times \text{Payoff at } S_{uu} + (1-p) \times \text{Payoff at } S_{ud}) \).
     - Option value = \( 1.02532^{-1} \times (0.4651 \times 0 + 0.5349 \times 6.43) = 0.5349 \times 6.43 / 1.02532 = 3.35 \).

   - At node \( S_d \) (after one period):
     - Option value = \( e^{-r \Delta t} \times (p \times \text{Payoff at } S_{ud} + (1-p) \times \text{Payoff at } S_{dd}) \).
     - Option value = \( 1.02532^{-1} \times (0.4651 \times 6.43 + 0.5349 \times 24.55) = 0.4651 \times 6.43 + 0.5349 \times 24.55 / 1.02532 = 14.02 \).

5. **Calculate the option price at the initial node:**

   - Option value = \( e^{-r \Delta t} \times (p \times \text{Option value at } S_u + (1-p) \times \text{Option value at } S_d) \).
   - Option value = \( 1.02532^{-1} \times (0.4651 \times 3.35 + 0.5349 \times 14.02) = 0.4651 \times 3.35 + 0.5349 \times 14.02 / 1.02532 = 8.08 \).

The star's initial radius was $7 \tims 10^5$ km (comparable to our sun); its final radius is 16 km. If the original star rotated once in 30 days, find the angular speed (in rad/s) of the neutron star.",4600.0,"To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by:

\[ L = I \omega \]

where \( L \) is the angular momentum, \( I \) is the moment of inertia, and \( \omega \) is the angular speed.

For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[ I = \frac{2}{5} m r^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

Since angular momentum is conserved, the initial angular momentum \( L_i \) is equal to the final angular momentum \( L_f \):

\[ I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f \]

Substituting the moment of inertia for a solid sphere, we have:

\[ \frac{2}{5} m_i r_i^2 \omega_i = \frac{2}{5} m_f r_f^2 \omega_f \]

The mass of the star remains constant during the collapse, so \( m_i = m_f = m \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[ r_i^2 \omega_i = r_f^2 \omega_f \]

We need to find the final angular speed \( \omega_f \). Rearranging the equation gives:

\[ \omega_f = \omega_i \frac{r_i^2}{r_f^2} \]

The initial angular speed \( \omega_i \) is given by:

\[ \omega_i = \frac{2\pi}{T_i} \]

where \( T_i \) is the initial period of rotation. Given that the star rotates once in 30 days, we convert this period into seconds:

\[ T_i = 30 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 2,592,000 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the initial angular speed is:

\[ \omega_i = \frac{2\pi}{2,592,000} \]

Now, substitute the values for \( r_i \) and \( r_f \):

- Initial radius \( r_i = 7 \times 10^5 \) km = \( 7 \times 10^8 \) meters
- Final radius \( r_f = 16 \) km = \( 16,000 \) meters

Substitute these into the equation for \( \omega_f \):

\[ \omega_f = \left(\frac{2\pi}{2,592,000}\right) \frac{(7 \times 10^8)^2}{(16,000)^2} \]

Calculate the ratio of the squares of the radii:

\[ \frac{(7 \times 10^8)^2}{(16,000)^2} = \frac{49 \times 10^{16}}{256 \times 10^6} = \frac{49}{256} \times 10^{10} \]

Now calculate \( \omega_f \):

\[ \omega_f = \frac{2\pi}{2,592,000} \times \frac{49}{256} \times 10^{10} \]

\[ \omega_f = \frac{2\pi \times 49 \times 10^{10}}{256 \times 2,592,000} \]

\[ \omega_f = \frac{98\pi \times 10^{10}}{256 \times 2,592,000} \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 256 \times 2,592,000 = 663,552,000 \]

Now, calculate \( \omega_f \):

\[ \omega_f = \frac{98\pi \times 10^{10}}{663,552,000} \]

\[ \omega_f = \frac{98 \times 3.141592653589793 \times 10^{10}}{663,552,000} \]

\[ \omega_f \approx \frac{307.8760800517997 \times 10^{10}}{663,552,000} \]

\[ \omega_f \approx \frac{307.8760800517997 \times 10^{10}}{6.63552 \times 10^8} \]

The solid is bounded by the elliptical paraboloid \( z = 2x^2 + y^2 + 1 \), the plane \( x + y = 1 \), and the coordinate planes \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \).

First, we determine the region of integration in the \( xy \)-plane. The plane \( x + y = 1 \) intersects the \( xy \)-plane along the line \( x + y = 1 \). The region of integration in the \( xy \)-plane is the triangular region bounded by \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( x + y = 1 \).

The limits for \( x \) and \( y \) are:
- \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
- \( 0 \leq y \leq 1 - x \)

The volume is given by the integral:
\[
V = \int_{x=0}^{1} \int_{y=0}^{1-x} \int_{z=0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{z=0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} \, dz = [z]_{0}^{2x^2 + y^2 + 1} = 2x^2 + y^2 + 1
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \( y \):
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + y^2 + 1) \, dy = \int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + 1) \, dy + \int_{y=0}^{1-x} y^2 \, dy
\]

Calculate each part:
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + 1) \, dy = (2x^2 + 1)[y]_{0}^{1-x} = (2x^2 + 1)(1-x)
\]

\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} y^2 \, dy = \left[\frac{y^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{1-x} = \frac{(1-x)^3}{3}
\]

Combine these results:
\[
\int_{y=0}^{1-x} (2x^2 + y^2 + 1) \, dy = (2x^2 + 1)(1-x) + \frac{(1-x)^3}{3}
\]

Simplify:

Combine terms:
\[

\]

\[

\[

Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):
\[

Calculate each part:
\[
\int_{x=0}^{1} \frac{4}{3} \, dx = \frac{4}{3}x \bigg|_{0}^{1} = \frac{4}{3}

\[
\int_{x=0}^{1} x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} \bigg|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{3}

\[

Note all three surfaces of this solid are included in $S$.,0.0,"To solve this problem, we will use the divergence theorem, which states:

\[
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV
\]

where \( V \) is the volume enclosed by the surface \( S \).

First, we need to compute the divergence of the vector field \( \vec{F} = yx^2 \vec{i} + (xy^2 - 3z^4)\vec{j} + (x^3+y^3)\vec{k} \).

The divergence is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(yx^2) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy^2 - 3z^4) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x^3 + y^3)
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(yx^2) = 2yx\)
2. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy^2 - 3z^4) = 2xy\)
3. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(x^3 + y^3) = 0\)

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = 2yx + 2xy = 4xy
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the integral over the volume \( V \), which is the region of the sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 16 \) with \( z \leq 0 \) and \( y \leq 0 \).

In spherical coordinates, the volume element is \( dV = \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta \).

The limits for \( \rho \) are from 0 to 4, for \( \phi \) from \(\pi/2\) to \(\pi\) (since \( z \leq 0 \)), and for \( \theta \) from \(\pi\) to \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) (since \( y \leq 0 \)).

The expression for \( x \) and \( y \) in spherical coordinates is:

\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \quad y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta
\]

Thus, \( xy = \rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\iiint_V 4xy \, dV = \int_{\pi}^{\frac{3\pi}{2}} \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \int_0^4 4(\rho^2 \sin^2 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta) \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

Simplifying:

\[
= 4 \int_{\pi}^{\frac{3\pi}{2}} \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \int_0^4 \rho^4 \sin^3 \phi \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

The \(\rho\) integral:

\[
\int_0^4 \rho^4 \, d\rho = \left[\frac{\rho^5}{5}\right]_0^4 = \frac{1024}{5}
\]

The \(\phi\) integral:

\[
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \sin^3 \phi \, d\phi = \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} (1 - \cos^2 \phi) \sin \phi \, d\phi = \left[-\frac{1}{3} \cos^3 \phi \right]_{\pi/2}^{\pi} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

The \(\theta\) integral:

\[
\int_{\pi}^{\frac{3\pi}{2}} \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\pi}^{\frac{3\pi}{2}} \sin 2\theta \, d\theta = \left[-\frac{1}{4} \cos 2\theta \right]_{\pi}^{\frac{3\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}

Putting it all together:

\[
4 \cdot \frac{1024}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4096}{15}

Thus, the solution to the problem is:

First, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern:

- \( a_0 = \frac{5}{2} \)
- \( a_1 = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{25}{4} - 2 = \frac{25}{4} - \frac{8}{4} = \frac{17}{4} \)
- \( a_2 = \left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{289}{16} - 2 = \frac{289}{16} - \frac{32}{16} = \frac{257}{16} \)

The sequence \( a_k \) is related to the recurrence relation of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, where \( a_k = 2 \cos(2^k \theta) \) for some angle \( \theta \). Specifically, the sequence is related to the transformation \( a_k = 2 \cosh(2^k \theta) \).

The product we need to compute is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{a_k}\right)
\]

Given the relation to the Chebyshev polynomials, we can use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{a_k}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This identity arises from the fact that the infinite product of terms of the form \( 1 - \frac{1}{a_k} \) converges to a known value when \( a_k \) follows the recurrence relation of Chebyshev polynomials.

1. **Calculate the present value of dividends during the high growth period:**

   - Year 1 to Year 5: Growth rate = 25%, Payout ratio = 20%
   - Dividends in Year 1 = Earnings * Payout ratio = 1 * 0.20 = 0.20
   - Dividends in Year 2 = 0.20 * (1 + 0.25) = 0.25
   - Dividends in Year 3 = 0.25 * (1 + 0.25) = 0.3125
   - Dividends in Year 4 = 0.3125 * (1 + 0.25) = 0.390625
   - Dividends in Year 5 = 0.390625 * (1 + 0.25) = 0.48828125

   Discount these dividends back to present value using the cost of equity (11.5%):

   - PV of Dividends = 0.20 / (1.115)^1 + 0.25 / (1.115)^2 + 0.3125 / (1.115)^3 + 0.390625 / (1.115)^4 + 0.48828125 / (1.115)^5

   - PV of Dividends ≈ 0.1794 + 0.2011 + 0.2243 + 0.2488 + 0.2745 ≈ 1.1281

2. **Calculate the terminal value at the end of Year 5:**

   - Growth rate after Year 5 = 8%, Payout ratio = 50%
   - Dividends in Year 6 = Earnings in Year 5 * (1 + 0.08) * Payout ratio = 0.48828125 * (1 + 0.08) * 0.50 = 0.2630859375

   - Terminal value at Year 5 = Dividends in Year 6 / (Cost of equity - Growth rate after Year 5)
   - Terminal value = 0.2630859375 / (0.115 - 0.08) = 0.2630859375 / 0.035 = 7.5167

   Discount the terminal value back to present value:

   - PV of Terminal Value = 7.5167 / (1.115)^5 ≈ 4.384

3. **Calculate the total present value of dividends and terminal value:**

   - Total PV = PV of Dividends + PV of Terminal Value = 1.1281 + 4.384 ≈ 5.5121

4. **Calculate the PE ratio:**

   - PE ratio = Total PV / Earnings = 5.5121 / 1 = 5.5121

Therefore, the estimated PE ratio for the firm is approximately:

How long does it take for the tank to go from full to empty?,7142,"The time it takes for the tank to empty can be calculated using Torricelli's Law, which states that the speed \( v \) of efflux of a fluid under gravity through an orifice is given by:

\[ v = \sqrt{2gh} \]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)) and \( h \) is the height of the fluid above the orifice.

The flow rate \( Q \) through the orifice is given by:

\[ Q = A \cdot v \]

where \( A \) is the area of the orifice. For a square hole with side 2 cm (0.02 m), the area \( A \) is:

\[ A = (0.02 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.0004 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The volume of the cylindrical tank is:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (1 \, \text{m})^2 (4 \, \text{m}) = 4\pi \, \text{m}^3 \]

The rate of change of volume \( \frac{dV}{dt} \) is equal to the negative of the flow rate:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = -A \sqrt{2gh} \]

Since the volume \( V \) is related to the height \( h \) by \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} = -A \sqrt{2gh} \]

Substituting \( r = 1 \, \text{m} \), we get:

\[ \pi \frac{dh}{dt} = -0.0004 \sqrt{2gh} \]

Rearranging and integrating from \( h = 4 \) to \( h = 0 \):

\[ \int_{4}^{0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \, dh = -\frac{0.0004 \sqrt{2g}}{\pi} \int_{0}^{t} \, dt \]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \) is \( 2\sqrt{h} \), so:

\[ 2\sqrt{h} \bigg|_{4}^{0} = -\frac{0.0004 \sqrt{2g}}{\pi} t \]

\[ 2(0) - 2(2) = -\frac{0.0004 \sqrt{2 \times 9.81}}{\pi} t \]

\[ -4 = -\frac{0.0004 \times \sqrt{19.62}}{\pi} t \]

\[ 4 = \frac{0.0004 \times 4.427}{\pi} t \]

\[ 4 = \frac{0.0017708}{\pi} t \]

\[ t = \frac{4 \pi}{0.0017708} \]

\[ t \approx \frac{12.5664}{0.0017708} \]

\[ t \approx 7096.5 \]

Therefore, the time it takes for the tank to empty is approximately:

Calculate each integral separately:

2. \(\int_{0}^{5} -2 \, dt = -2 \times (5 - 0) = -2 \times 5 = -10\)

Substitute these results back into the expression for \( c_0 \):

311,,What is \int_{-3}^1 (7x^2 + x +1)dx?,65.333,"The solution to the integral \(\int_{-3}^1 (7x^2 + x + 1) \, dx\) involves finding the antiderivative of the function and then evaluating it at the given limits.

First, find the antiderivative of \(7x^2 + x + 1\):

1. The antiderivative of \(7x^2\) is \(\frac{7}{3}x^3\).
2. The antiderivative of \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{2}x^2\).
3. The antiderivative of \(1\) is \(x\).

Thus, the antiderivative of \(7x^2 + x + 1\) is:

\[
F(x) = \frac{7}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x
\]

Now, evaluate \(F(x)\) at the upper and lower limits of the integral:

\[
F(1) = \frac{7}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + 1 = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + 1
\]

\[
F(-3) = \frac{7}{3}(-3)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(-3)^2 + (-3) = \frac{7}{3}(-27) + \frac{1}{2}(9) - 3
\]

Calculate \(F(1)\):

\[
F(1) = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{3}{2}
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6:

\[
F(1) = \frac{14}{6} + \frac{9}{6} = \frac{23}{6}
\]

Calculate \(F(-3)\):

\[
F(-3) = \frac{7}{3}(-27) + \frac{1}{2}(9) - 3 = -63 + \frac{9}{2} - 3
\]

Convert \(-63\) and \(-3\) to fractions with a denominator of 2:

\[
F(-3) = -\frac{126}{2} + \frac{9}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = -\frac{126}{2} + \frac{9}{2} - \frac{6}{2}
\]

Combine the fractions:

\[
F(-3) = -\frac{126}{2} + \frac{9}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = -\frac{123}{2}
\]

Now, find the definite integral by subtracting:

\[
\int_{-3}^1 (7x^2 + x + 1) \, dx = F(1) - F(-3) = \frac{23}{6} - \left(-\frac{123}{2}\right)
\]

Convert \(\frac{23}{6}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:

\[
\frac{23}{6} = \frac{23}{6}
\]

Convert \(-\frac{123}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:

\[
-\frac{123}{2} = -\frac{369}{6}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{23}{6} + \frac{369}{6} = \frac{392}{6}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{392}{6}\):

\[
\frac{392}{6} = \frac{196}{3}

Unpolarized light passes through a polarizer. It then passes through another polarizer at angle 30 degree to the first, and then another at angle 50 degree to the second. What percentage of the original intensity was the light coming out of the third polarizer?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we need to apply Malus' law twice, as the light passes through two polarizers after the initial one.

1. **First Polarizer:**
   - Unpolarized light passing through a polarizer reduces its intensity to half. So, after the first polarizer, the intensity \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \).

2. **Second Polarizer:**
   - The angle between the first and second polarizer is 30 degrees.
   - Using Malus' law: \( I_2 = I_1 \cdot \cos^2(30^\circ) \).
   - \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3I_0}{8} \).

3. **Third Polarizer:**
   - The angle between the second and third polarizer is 50 degrees.
   - Using Malus' law again: \( I_3 = I_2 \cdot \cos^2(50^\circ) \).
   - \( \cos(50^\circ) \approx 0.6428 \).
   - Therefore, \( I_3 = \frac{3I_0}{8} \cdot (0.6428)^2 \approx \frac{3I_0}{8} \cdot 0.4132 \approx \frac{3I_0 \cdot 0.4132}{8} \approx 0.15495I_0 \).

Finally, to find the percentage of the original intensity, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{I_3}{I_0}\right) \times 100\% = 0.15495 \times 100\% \approx 15.495\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the original intensity that the light has after passing through the third polarizer is approximately:

1. **Determine the speed of sound at 8000 m altitude.**  
   The speed of sound at sea level is approximately 343 m/s. However, at higher altitudes, the speed of sound decreases due to lower temperatures. For this problem, let's assume the speed of sound at 8000 m is approximately 320 m/s (a typical value at that altitude).

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}
\]

First, consider the inner series:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}
\]

For large \( n \), \( k 2^n \) becomes very large, and the terms \(\frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}\) approach zero. However, for small \( n \), the terms are significant. Let's evaluate the first few terms:

- For \( n = 0 \), the term is \(\frac{1}{k \cdot 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{k + 1}\).
- For \( n = 1 \), the term is \(\frac{1}{k \cdot 2 + 1} = \frac{1}{2k + 1}\).
- For \( n = 2 \), the term is \(\frac{1}{k \cdot 4 + 1} = \frac{1}{4k + 1}\).

The series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}\) converges, but its exact sum is not straightforward to express in a simple closed form. However, we can analyze the behavior of the series by considering the first few terms and the fact that the terms decrease rapidly.

Now, consider the outer series:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}
\]

This is an alternating series, and the terms \(\frac{1}{k}\) decrease in magnitude. The alternating series test suggests that if the terms decrease in magnitude and approach zero, the series converges.

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\) is the well-known alternating harmonic series, which converges to \(\ln(2)\).

The inner series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}\) is a positive series that converges for each \( k \). The convergence of the entire double series depends on the convergence of both the inner and outer series.

Given the structure of the problem and the convergence of the alternating harmonic series, the entire series converges to a value that can be determined by considering the behavior of the terms.

The alternating harmonic series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\) converges to \(\ln(2)\), and the inner series contributes a factor that does not change the convergence of the outer series.

Thus, the value of the entire series is:

Estimate the walking speed of T. rex. (Unit: m/s)",1.4,"To estimate the walking speed of T. rex, we can use the relationship between the stride length, leg length, and the natural frequency of a pendulum. The walking speed \( v \) can be estimated using the formula:

\[ v = \frac{S}{T} \]

where \( S \) is the stride length and \( T \) is the period of the pendulum, which can be approximated by the formula for the period of a simple pendulum:

\[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \]

where \( L \) is the leg length and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

First, calculate the period \( T \):

\[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{3.1}{9.8}} \]

\[ T \approx 2\pi \sqrt{0.3163} \]

\[ T \approx 2\pi \times 0.5625 \]

\[ T \approx 3.533 \, \text{s} \]

Now, calculate the walking speed \( v \):

\[ v \approx 1.133 \, \text{m/s} \]

What is the integral of f(x,y) over the region I=[0,1]\times[0,1]?",0.16667,"The integral of \( f(x, y) \) over the region \( I = [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \) can be calculated by considering the region where \( f(x, y) = 1 - x - y \), which is when \( x + y \leq 1 \).

The region where \( x + y \leq 1 \) is a right triangle with vertices at \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \).

The integral of \( f(x, y) = 1 - x - y \) over this triangular region is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^{1-x} (1-x-y) \, dy \, dx
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( y \):

\[
\int_0^{1-x} (1-x-y) \, dy = \left[ (1-x)y - \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^{1-x} = (1-x)(1-x) - \frac{(1-x)^2}{2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
= (1-x)^2 - \frac{(1-x)^2}{2} = \frac{(1-x)^2}{2}
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{(1-x)^2}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 (1-x)^2 \, dx
\]

Calculate the integral:

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{(1-x)^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{0^3}{3} - \frac{1^3}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 0 - \frac{1}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{6}
\]

Since the integral represents an area, we take the absolute value:

\[
= \frac{1}{6}

370,,The polynomial $x^3 - Ax + 15$ has three real roots. Two of these roots sum to 5. What is |A|?,22.0,"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( |A| \) for the polynomial \( x^3 - Ax + 15 \) given that it has three real roots and two of these roots sum to 5.

Let the roots of the polynomial be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, we have:

1. \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0 \)
2. \( r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = -A \)
3. \( r_1r_2r_3 = -15 \)

We are given that two of the roots sum to 5. Without loss of generality, assume \( r_1 + r_2 = 5 \). Then, from the first Vieta's formula, we have:

\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0 \implies 5 + r_3 = 0 \implies r_3 = -5
\]

Now, substitute \( r_3 = -5 \) into the third Vieta's formula:

\[
r_1r_2(-5) = -15 \implies r_1r_2 = 3
\]

We now have two equations involving \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):

1. \( r_1 + r_2 = 5 \)
2. \( r_1r_2 = 3 \)

These are the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation. The quadratic equation with these roots is:

\[
x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2 = 0 \implies x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0
\]

The roots of this quadratic equation are:

\[
r_1, r_2 = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 12}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
\]

Thus, the roots of the original cubic polynomial are \( \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{2}, \frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{2}, \) and \( -5 \).

Now, use the second Vieta's formula to find \( A \):

\[
r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = -A
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
3 + \left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\right)(-5) + \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right)(-5) = -A
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
3 - \frac{5(5 - \sqrt{13})}{2} - \frac{5(5 + \sqrt{13})}{2} = -A
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
3 - \frac{25 - 5\sqrt{13} + 25 + 5\sqrt{13}}{2} = -A
\]

\[
3 - \frac{50}{2} = -A
\]

\[
3 - 25 = -A
\]

\[
-22 = -A \implies A = 22
\]

Thus, the absolute value of \( A \) is:

\[
|A| = 22
\]

This expression is known to be related to the identity for the cosine of the sum of angles in a triangle. Specifically, if \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) are the angles of a triangle, then:

\[ \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) + 2 \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) \cos(\gamma) = 1 \]

This identity holds because it is derived from the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(\pi\), and the cosine of the sum of angles can be expressed in terms of the cosines of the individual angles.

The fishbowl is formed by removing the top third of a sphere of radius \( r = 6 \). Therefore, the height of the fishbowl is \( \frac{4r}{3} = \frac{4 \times 6}{3} = 8 \).

The marble is at the bottom of the fishbowl, which is the center of the sphere. The maximum height the marble can reach is the height of the fishbowl, which is 8. The marble must have enough initial velocity to reach this height and then return to the bottom of the fishbowl.

Using energy conservation, the potential energy at the maximum height is equal to the initial kinetic energy:

\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2

where \( h = 8 \) and \( g = 9.8 \).

Solving for \( v \):

A sled and rider with total mass 70.0 kg are pushed against the other end, compressing the spring 0.375 m. The sled is then released with zero initial velocity. What is the sled's speed (in m/s) when the spring returns to its uncompressed length?",2.83,"To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy. The potential energy stored in the compressed spring is converted into the kinetic energy of the sled and rider when the spring returns to its uncompressed length.

1. **Calculate the potential energy stored in the spring:**

   The potential energy \( PE \) stored in a spring is given by the formula:
   \[
   PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
   \]
   where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( x \) is the compression distance.

   Given:
   - \( k = 40.0 \, \text{N/cm} = 4000 \, \text{N/m} \) (since 1 N/cm = 100 N/m)
   - \( x = 0.375 \, \text{m} \)

   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 4000 \, \text{N/m} \times (0.375 \, \text{m})^2
   \]
   \[
   PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 4000 \times 0.140625
   \]
   \[
   PE = 281.25 \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Convert the potential energy to kinetic energy:**

   The kinetic energy \( KE \) of the sled and rider when the spring is uncompressed is equal to the potential energy stored in the spring:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]
   where \( m \) is the mass and \( v \) is the velocity.

   Given:
   - \( m = 70.0 \, \text{kg} \)

   Set the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70.0 \, \text{kg} \times v^2 = 281.25 \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Solve for the velocity \( v \):**

   \[
   35.0 \, \text{kg} \times v^2 = 281.25 \, \text{J}

   \[
   v^2 = \frac{281.25}{35.0}

The production function for fur bow ties (q) is given by q = 240x - 2x^2, where x is the quantity of pelts used each week. Pelts are supplied only by Dan's Trading Post, which obtains them by hiring Eskimo trappers at a rate of $10 per day. Dan's weekly production function for pelts is given by x = \sqrt{l}, where l represents the number of days of Eskimo time used each week. For a quasi-competitive case in which both Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post act as price-takers for pelts, what will be the equilibrium price (p_x) for pelt?",600,"To find the equilibrium price for pelts (\(p_x\)), we need to determine the marginal cost of producing pelts and equate it to the marginal revenue product of pelts.

1. **Production Function for Bow Ties:**
   \[
   q = 240x - 2x^2
   \]
   The price of each bow tie is $5, so the revenue function is:
   \[
   R = 5q = 5(240x - 2x^2) = 1200x - 10x^2
   \]

2. **Marginal Revenue Product of Pelts:**
   The marginal revenue product (MRP) is the derivative of the revenue function with respect to \(x\):
   \[
   MRP = \frac{dR}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(1200x - 10x^2) = 1200 - 20x
   \]

3. **Production Function for Pelts:**
   \[
   x = \sqrt{l}
   \]
   Solving for \(l\), we have:
   \[
   l = x^2
   \]

4. **Cost of Producing Pelts:**
   The cost of hiring Eskimo trappers is $10 per day, so the total cost function for pelts is:
   \[
   C = 10l = 10x^2
   \]

5. **Marginal Cost of Pelts:**
   The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the cost function with respect to \(x\):
   \[
   MC = \frac{dC}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(10x^2) = 20x
   \]

6. **Equilibrium Condition:**
   In equilibrium, the marginal cost of pelts equals the marginal revenue product of pelts:
   \[
   20x = 1200 - 20x
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   40x = 1200 \implies x = 30
   \]

7. **Equilibrium Price for Pelts:**
   The equilibrium price for pelts is the marginal cost at \(x = 30\):
   \[
   p_x = MC = 20x = 20(30) = 600
   \]

Thus, the equilibrium price for pelts is:

where:
- \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( m \) is the mass of one molecule of the gas in kilograms.

For hydrogen (H2), the molar mass is approximately 2 grams per mole, or \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg/mol} \). The mass of one molecule is:

\[ m = \frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/molecule} \]

Assuming room temperature, \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \).

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 298}{3.32 \times 10^{-27}}} \]

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{1.23444 \times 10^{-20}}{3.32 \times 10^{-27}}} \]

\[ v = \sqrt{3.717 \times 10^{6}} \]

\[ v \approx 1928 \, \text{m/s} \]

The Lagrangian is given by:
\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 2x - 5y + \lambda (x^2 + y^2 - 144)
\]

Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero, we have:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2 + 2\lambda x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda x = -1
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = -5 + 2\lambda y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda y = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = x^2 + y^2 - 144 = 0
\]

From \(\lambda x = -1\), we have \(\lambda = -\frac{1}{x}\).

From \(\lambda y = \frac{5}{2}\), we have \(\lambda = \frac{5}{2y}\).

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\):
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{2y} \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2y = 5x \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -\frac{5}{2}x
\]

Substitute \(y = -\frac{5}{2}x\) into the constraint:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\frac{5}{2}x\right)^2 = 144
\]
\[
x^2 + \frac{25}{4}x^2 = 144

\[
\frac{29}{4}x^2 = 144
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{144 \times 4}{29} = \frac{576}{29}

\[
x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}

Calculate \(y\) using \(y = -\frac{5}{2}x\):
\[
y = -\frac{5}{2} \left(\pm \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\right) = \mp \frac{5}{2} \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}
\]

Now, calculate \(f(x, y)\) for both cases:
1. \(x = \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\), \(y = -\frac{5}{2} \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\):
   \[
   f(x, y) = 2\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} - 5\left(-\frac{5}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\right) = 2\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} + \frac{25}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{4}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} + \frac{25}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} = \frac{29}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{29}{2} \times \frac{24}{\sqrt{29}} = \frac{29 \times 24}{2 \times \sqrt{29}} = \frac{348}{\sqrt{29}}
   \]

2. \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\), \(y = \frac{5}{2} \sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\):
   \[
   f(x, y) = 2\left(-\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\right) - 5\left(\frac{5}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}\right) = -2\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} - \frac{25}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}
   \]
   \[
   = -\frac{4}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} - \frac{25}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}} = -\frac{29}{2}\sqrt{\frac{576}{29}}

   \[
   = -\frac{348}{\sqrt{29}}

The minimum value is \(-\frac{348}{\sqrt{29}}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(f(x, y)\) is:

470,,Find the last 3 digits of 2003^(2002^2001).,241,"The problem requires finding the last three digits of \(2003^{2002^{2001}}\), which is equivalent to finding \(2003^{2002^{2001}} \mod 1000\).

First, note that \(2003 \equiv 3 \pmod{1000}\). Therefore, we need to find \(3^{2002^{2001}} \mod 1000\).

To solve this, we can use Euler's theorem, which states that if \(a\) is coprime to \(n\), then \(a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}\), where \(\phi(n)\) is the Euler's totient function.

Calculate \(\phi(1000)\):
\[
\phi(1000) = 1000 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 400
\]

Thus, \(3^{400} \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\).

Now, we need to find \(2002^{2001} \mod 400\) to reduce the exponent modulo 400.

Calculate \(\phi(400)\):
\[
\phi(400) = 400 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 400 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 160
\]

Thus, \(a^{160} \equiv 1 \pmod{400}\) for any \(a\) coprime to 400.

Now, find \(2002 \equiv 2 \pmod{400}\). We need to find \(2^{2001} \mod 400\).

Since \(2^{160} \equiv 1 \pmod{400}\), we have:
\[
2001 \equiv 1 \pmod{160} \quad (\text{since } 2001 = 160 \times 12 + 1)

Thus, \(2^{2001} \equiv 2^1 \equiv 2 \pmod{400}\).

Now, we need to find \(3^2 \mod 1000\):

493,,Use the linear approximation to estimate (3.99)^3 (1.01)^4 (1.98)^{-1}.,33.36,"The linear approximation for a function \( f(x) \) around a point \( a \) is given by:

\[
f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
\]

We will use this approximation for each factor in the expression \( (3.99)^3 (1.01)^4 (1.98)^{-1} \).

1. **Approximate \( (3.99)^3 \):**

   Let \( f(x) = x^3 \). Then \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \).

   Approximate around \( a = 4 \):

   \[
   f(3.99) \approx f(4) + f'(4)(3.99 - 4)
   \]

   \[
   f(4) = 4^3 = 64
   \]

   \[
   f'(4) = 3 \times 4^2 = 48
   \]

   \[
   f(3.99) \approx 64 + 48 \times (-0.01) = 64 - 0.48 = 63.52
   \]

2. **Approximate \( (1.01)^4 \):**

   Let \( g(x) = x^4 \). Then \( g'(x) = 4x^3 \).

   Approximate around \( a = 1 \):

   \[
   g(1.01) \approx g(1) + g'(1)(1.01 - 1)
   \]

   \[
   g(1) = 1^4 = 1
   \]

   \[
   g'(1) = 4 \times 1^3 = 4
   \]

   \[
   g(1.01) \approx 1 + 4 \times 0.01 = 1 + 0.04 = 1.04
   \]

3. **Approximate \( (1.98)^{-1} \):**

   Let \( h(x) = x^{-1} \). Then \( h'(x) = -x^{-2} \).

   Approximate around \( a = 2 \):

   \[
   h(1.98) \approx h(2) + h'(2)(1.98 - 2)
   \]

   \[
   h(2) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

   \[
   h'(2) = -\frac{1}{2^2} = -\frac{1}{4} = -0.25
   \]

   \[
   h(1.98) \approx 0.5 - 0.25 \times (-0.02) = 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505
   \]

Now, multiply the approximations:

\[
(3.99)^3 (1.01)^4 (1.98)^{-1} \approx 63.52 \times 1.04 \times 0.505
\]

Calculate the product:

\[
63.52 \times 1.04 = 66.0608
\]

\[
66.0608 \times 0.505 \approx 33.363104
\]

Thus, the estimated value is approximately:

\[
\boxed{33.36}

509,,"Find the curvature for f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2}, x = 2.",0.5,"1. To find the curvature \( \kappa \) of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2} \) at \( x = 2 \), we first need to find the first and second derivatives of \( f(x) \).

2. The function can be rewritten as \( f(x) = (4x - x^2)^{1/2} \).

3. The first derivative \( f'(x) \) is found using the chain rule:
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (4 - 2x)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{4 - 2x}{2\sqrt{4x - x^2}}
   \]

4. The second derivative \( f''(x) \) is found by differentiating \( f'(x) \):
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{4 - 2x}{2\sqrt{4x - x^2}} \right)
   \]
   Using the quotient rule, where \( u = 4 - 2x \) and \( v = 2\sqrt{4x - x^2} \), we have:
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{(v \cdot u' - u \cdot v')}{v^2}
   \]
   \[
   u' = -2, \quad v = 2(4x - x^2)^{1/2}, \quad v' = \frac{2(4 - 2x)(-1/2)(4x - x^2)^{-1/2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying \( v' \), we get:
   \[
   v' = \frac{-(4 - 2x)}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}}
   \]
   Plugging into the quotient rule:
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{2\sqrt{4x - x^2}(-2) - (4 - 2x)\left(\frac{-(4 - 2x)}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}}\right)}{(2\sqrt{4x - x^2})^2}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{-4\sqrt{4x - x^2} + \frac{(4 - 2x)^2}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}}}{4(4x - x^2)}
   \]
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{-4(4x - x^2) + (4 - 2x)^2}{4(4x - x^2)^{3/2}}
   \]

5. Evaluate \( f'(x) \) and \( f''(x) \) at \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   f'(2) = \frac{4 - 2(2)}{2\sqrt{4(2) - 2^2}} = \frac{0}{2\sqrt{4}} = 0
   \]
   \[
   f''(2) = \frac{-4(4(2) - 2^2) + (4 - 2(2))^2}{4(4(2) - 2^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{-4(8 - 4) + 0}{4(4)^{3/2}}
   \]
   \[
   f''(2) = \frac{-16}{32} = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

6. The formula for curvature \( \kappa \) is:
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{(1 + (f'(x))^2)^{3/2}}
   \]
   At \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{|-1/2|}{(1 + 0^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}

Suppose you want to use the thresholding technique to segment the image. What is the appropriate threshold value based on the histogram of the image? Follow the following rule when you do thresholding or grouping: pixel $(i, j) \in$ Group A pixels if $g(i, j) \leq$ current threshold $\mathrm{T}$; pixel $(i, j) \in$ Group B pixels otherwise, where $g(i, j)$ is the intensity value of pixel $(i, j)$.",4,"To determine the appropriate threshold value for segmenting the image using the thresholding technique, we need to analyze the histogram of the image. The histogram represents the frequency of each intensity value in the image.

First, let's list the intensity values from the given image:

```
7, 1, 6, 0
3, 3, 7, 6
6, 6, 5, 7
```

Now, let's count the frequency of each intensity value:

- 0 appears 1 time
- 1 appears 1 time
- 3 appears 2 times
- 5 appears 1 time
- 6 appears 4 times
- 7 appears 3 times

The histogram of the image is:
- 0: 1
- 1: 1
- 3: 2
- 5: 1
- 6: 4
- 7: 3

To find the appropriate threshold value, we typically look for a value that separates the histogram into two distinct groups. A common approach is to choose a threshold that maximizes the separation between the two groups.

In this case, the intensity values range from 0 to 7. The most frequent values are 6 and 7, which suggests that the threshold should be chosen to separate these higher values from the lower ones.

A reasonable choice for the threshold is the value that separates the lower half of the histogram from the upper half. The cumulative frequency distribution is:

- Up to 0: 1
- Up to 1: 2
- Up to 3: 4
- Up to 5: 5
- Up to 6: 9
- Up to 7: 12

The total number of pixels is 12. The midpoint of the cumulative distribution is 6. The value that corresponds to this midpoint is 6.

Therefore, the appropriate threshold value is 6.

Let $\tau=2.5$. Determine $y(\tau)$.,2,"To solve for \( y(\tau) \) when \(\tau = 2.5\), we need to evaluate the convolution integral:

\[
y(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau-t) v(t) \, dt
\]

Given the signals:

\[
x(t) = \begin{cases} 
1, & 0 \leq t \leq 3 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
v(t) = \begin{cases} 
1, & 0 \leq t \leq 2 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

The convolution \( y(\tau) \) is defined as:

\[
y(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau-t) v(t) \, dt
\]

Substitute \(\tau = 2.5\):

\[
y(2.5) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(2.5-t) v(t) \, dt
\]

The function \( x(2.5-t) \) is non-zero when:

\[
0 \leq 2.5-t \leq 3
\]

Solving for \( t \), we get:

\[
2.5 \leq t \leq 5.5
\]

The function \( v(t) \) is non-zero when:

\[
0 \leq t \leq 2
\]

The limits of integration are determined by the overlap of the intervals where \( x(2.5-t) \) and \( v(t) \) are non-zero:

- \( 2.5 \leq t \leq 5.5 \) for \( x(2.5-t) \)
- \( 0 \leq t \leq 2 \) for \( v(t) \)

The overlap is:

\[
2.5 \leq t \leq 2
\]

However, this interval is not valid because \( 2.5 > 2 \). Therefore, there is no overlap, and the integral evaluates to zero:

\[
y(2.5) = \int_{2.5}^{2} 1 \cdot 1 \, dt = 0
\]

Thus, the value of \( y(2.5) \) is:

559,,Let h(x) = (x^{-1/2} + 2x)(7 - x^{-1}). What is h'(x) when x = 4?,13.609,"To find \( h'(x) \) when \( x = 4 \), we first need to differentiate the function \( h(x) = (x^{-1/2} + 2x)(7 - x^{-1}) \).

First, let's expand the function \( h(x) \):

\[
h(x) = (x^{-1/2} + 2x)(7 - x^{-1}) = x^{-1/2}(7 - x^{-1}) + 2x(7 - x^{-1})
\]

\[
= 7x^{-1/2} - x^{-3/2} + 14x - 2
\]

Now, differentiate each term with respect to \( x \):

1. The derivative of \( 7x^{-1/2} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[7x^{-1/2}] = 7 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)x^{-3/2} = -\frac{7}{2}x^{-3/2}
   \]

2. The derivative of \( -x^{-3/2} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[-x^{-3/2}] = -\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)x^{-5/2} = \frac{3}{2}x^{-5/2}
   \]

3. The derivative of \( 14x \) is:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[14x] = 14
   \]

4. The derivative of \( -2 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[-2] = 0
   \]

Combine these derivatives to find \( h'(x) \):

\[
h'(x) = -\frac{7}{2}x^{-3/2} + \frac{3}{2}x^{-5/2} + 14
\]

Now, evaluate \( h'(x) \) at \( x = 4 \):

1. Calculate \( -\frac{7}{2} \cdot 4^{-3/2} \):
   \[
   4^{-3/2} = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}
   \]
   \[
   -\frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = -\frac{7}{16}
   \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4^{-5/2} \):
   \[
   4^{-5/2} = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}}\right)^5 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{32} = \frac{3}{64}
   \]

Combine these results:

\[
h'(4) = -\frac{7}{16} + \frac{3}{64} + 14
\]

Convert \(-\frac{7}{16}\) to a denominator of 64:

\[
-\frac{7}{16} = -\frac{28}{64}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
-\frac{28}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = -\frac{25}{64}
\]

Add 14:

\[
h'(4) = -\frac{25}{64} + 14 = 14 - \frac{25}{64}
\]

Convert 14 to a fraction with a denominator of 64:

\[
14 = \frac{896}{64}
\]

Now, subtract:

\[
h'(4) = \frac{896}{64} - \frac{25}{64} = \frac{871}{64}
\]

Thus, the value of \( h'(x) \) when \( x = 4 \) is:

Use natural logarithm to evaluate $\lim -\frac{1}{n}\log{q(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)}$ as $n \to \infty$.",1.4,"The problem involves evaluating the limit of the negative log-likelihood of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables under a different distribution. Specifically, we have:

- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots \) are i.i.d. random variables drawn from \( p(x) = N(0,1) \), the standard normal distribution.
- We want to evaluate the limit of the negative log-likelihood of these variables under the distribution \( q(x) = N(1,1) \).

The probability density function for a normal distribution \( N(\mu, \sigma^2) \) is given by:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\]

For \( q(x) = N(1,1) \), the density is:

\[
q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}\right)
\]

The joint density for \( n \) i.i.d. variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) under \( q \) is:

\[
q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n q(X_i) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^n \exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(X_i-1)^2}{2}\right)
\]

The negative log-likelihood is:

\[
-\log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = -n \log \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - 1)^2
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
-\log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \frac{n}{2} \log(2\pi) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - 1)^2
\]

We need to evaluate:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n} \log q(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) + \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - 1)^2 \right)
\]

By the law of large numbers, since \( X_i \sim N(0,1) \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 \to \mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = 1
\]

and

\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \to \mathbb{E}[X_i] = 0
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - 1)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i^2 - 2X_i + 1) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i + 1
\]

Taking the limit as \( n \to \infty \):

\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - 1)^2 \to 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
\]

Therefore, the limit becomes:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) + 1

What is $r^*$?",0.08,"To solve for \( r^* \) in the Vasicek model, we use the bond pricing formula for the Vasicek interest rate model. The price of a zero-coupon bond in the Vasicek model is given by:

\[
P(r, t, T) = A(t, T) e^{-B(t, T) r}
\]

where \( A(t, T) \) and \( B(t, T) \) are functions of time and the parameters of the Vasicek model. The function \( B(t, T) \) is given by:

\[
B(t, T) = \frac{1 - e^{-\kappa (T-t)}}{\kappa}

and \( A(t, T) \) is given by:

\[
A(t, T) = \exp\left( \left( \theta - \frac{\sigma^2}{2\kappa^2} \right) (B(t, T) - (T-t)) - \frac{\sigma^2}{4\kappa} B(t, T)^2 \right)
\]

Given the bond prices:

1. \( P(0.04, 0, 2) = 0.9445 \)
2. \( P(0.05, 1, 3) = 0.9321 \)
3. \( P(r^*, 2, 4) = 0.8960 \)

We need to find \( r^* \).

For the first bond:

\[
0.9445 = A(0, 2) e^{-B(0, 2) \cdot 0.04}
\]

For the second bond:

\[
0.9321 = A(1, 3) e^{-B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05}
\]

For the third bond:

\[
0.8960 = A(2, 4) e^{-B(2, 4) \cdot r^*}
\]

We can solve for \( r^* \) by using the relationship between the bond prices and the exponential terms. The ratio of the bond prices gives us:

\[
\frac{P(r^*, 2, 4)}{P(0.05, 1, 3)} = \frac{A(2, 4) e^{-B(2, 4) \cdot r^*}}{A(1, 3) e^{-B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05}}
\]

\[
\frac{0.8960}{0.9321} = \frac{A(2, 4)}{A(1, 3)} e^{-B(2, 4) \cdot r^* + B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05}
\]

Assuming \( A(2, 4) \approx A(1, 3) \) (since the time difference is small and the parameters are constant), we have:

\[
\frac{0.8960}{0.9321} = e^{-B(2, 4) \cdot r^* + B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.8960}{0.9321}\right) = -B(2, 4) \cdot r^* + B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05
\]

Solving for \( r^* \):

\[
r^* = \frac{B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05 - \ln\left(\frac{0.8960}{0.9321}\right)}{B(2, 4)}
\]

Given that \( B(1, 3) = B(2, 4) \) (since both are for a 2-year period), we can simplify:

\[
r^* = 0.05 - \frac{\ln\left(\frac{0.8960}{0.9321}\right)}{B(2, 4)}
\]

Calculating the logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.8960}{0.9321}\right) = \ln(0.9613) \approx -0.0395
\]

Thus:

\[
r^* = 0.05 + 0.0395 = 0.0895

Therefore, the value of \( r^* \) is:

phi(n) = n * (1 - 1/p)

For 29791 = 31^3, we have:

phi(29791) = 29791 * (1 - 1/31)

First, calculate 1 - 1/31:

1 - 1/31 = 30/31

Now, calculate phi(29791):

phi(29791) = 29791 * (30/31)

phi(29791) = 29791 * 30 / 31

H_1 (the alternative hypothesis): The coin is not fair, i.e. $\theta > 1 / 2$. We toss 100 times and observe 60 heads. What is the P-value?",0.023,"To calculate the P-value, we need to determine the probability of observing 60 or more heads in 100 tosses of a fair coin, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is a binomial problem where the number of trials \( n = 100 \) and the probability of success (heads) under the null hypothesis \( \theta_0 = 0.5 \).

The P-value is given by:

\[
P(X \geq 60) = \sum_{k=60}^{100} \binom{100}{k} (0.5)^k (0.5)^{100-k}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
P(X \geq 60) = \sum_{k=60}^{100} \binom{100}{k} (0.5)^{100}
\]

Using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, we can approximate this probability. The mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) of the binomial distribution are:

\[
\mu = n \cdot \theta_0 = 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50
\]
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot \theta_0 \cdot (1 - \theta_0)} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

We use the normal approximation:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{60 - 50}{5} = 2
\]

We need to find \(P(Z \geq 2)\). Using the standard normal distribution table, we find:

\[
P(Z \geq 2) = 1 - P(Z < 2) \approx 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228

Thus, the P-value is approximately:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \int_{0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy \, dx
\]

First, we integrate with respect to \(y\):

\[
\int_{0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy = x \int_{0}^{1} y^2 \, dy
\]

The integral \(\int_{0}^{1} y^2 \, dy\) is calculated as:

\[
\int_{0}^{1} y^2 \, dy = \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the inner integral becomes:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{3}
\]

Now, we integrate with respect to \(x\):

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{x}{3} \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \int_{0}^{2} x \, dx
\]

The integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x \, dx\) is calculated as:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} x \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2

Thus, the outer integral becomes:

In polar coordinates, the semicircle can be described by:

- The radius \( r \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 1/2 \).
- The angle \( \theta \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \pi \).

The transformation from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates is given by:
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} + r \cos \theta \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta \]

The Jacobian of the transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates is \( r \). Therefore, the double integral becomes:
\[
\iint_S y \, dx \, dy = \int_0^\pi \int_0^{1/2} (r \sin \theta) \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^\pi \int_0^{1/2} r^2 \sin \theta \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_0^{1/2} r^2 \, dr = \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^{1/2} = \frac{(1/2)^3}{3} = \frac{1}{24}

Now, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_0^\pi \sin \theta \, d\theta = \left[ -\cos \theta \right]_0^\pi = -\cos(\pi) + \cos(0) = 2

Thus, the value of the double integral is:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^{\langle n \rangle} + 2^{-\langle n \rangle}}{2^n}
\]

where \(\langle n \rangle\) denotes the closest integer to \(\sqrt{n}\).

First, we determine \(\langle n \rangle\) for various ranges of \(n\). The integer \(\langle n \rangle\) is the closest integer to \(\sqrt{n}\), which means:

- If \(k^2 \leq n < (k+0.5)^2\), then \(\langle n \rangle = k\).
- If \((k+0.5)^2 \leq n < (k+1)^2\), then \(\langle n \rangle = k+1\).

Let's calculate the series by considering the contributions from each range of \(n\).

1. **For \(k^2 \leq n < (k+0.5)^2\):**

   Here, \(\langle n \rangle = k\). The number of integers \(n\) in this range is \((k+0.5)^2 - k^2 = k^2 + k + 0.25 - k^2 = k + 0.25\).

   The contribution to the series from this range is:

   \[
   \sum_{n=k^2}^{(k+0.5)^2 - 1} \frac{2^k + 2^{-k}}{2^n}
   \]

2. **For \((k+0.5)^2 \leq n < (k+1)^2\):**

   Here, \(\langle n \rangle = k+1\). The number of integers \(n\) in this range is \((k+1)^2 - (k+0.5)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 - (k^2 + k + 0.25) = k + 0.75\).

   The contribution to the series from this range is:

   \[
   \sum_{n=(k+0.5)^2}^{(k+1)^2 - 1} \frac{2^{k+1} + 2^{-(k+1)}}{2^n}
   \]

Now, we sum these contributions over all \(k\).

The series can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \sum_{n=k^2}^{(k+0.5)^2 - 1} \frac{2^k + 2^{-k}}{2^n} + \sum_{n=(k+0.5)^2}^{(k+1)^2 - 1} \frac{2^{k+1} + 2^{-(k+1)}}{2^n} \right)
\]

\[
\Delta t' = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}

where:
- \(\Delta t'\) is the time interval measured by the moving clock (on the shuttle),
- \(\Delta t\) is the time interval measured by the stationary clock (on Earth),
- \(v\) is the velocity of the moving clock,
- \(c\) is the speed of light (\(c = 299,792,458 \, \text{m/s}\)).

The time lost per second due to special relativity is:

\[
\Delta t - \Delta t' = \Delta t \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\right)
\]

Given:
- \(v = 7712 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\Delta t = 1 \, \text{s}\).

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta t - \Delta t' = 1 \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{(7712)^2}{(299,792,458)^2}}\right)
\]

Calculate \(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(7712)^2}{(299,792,458)^2} \approx 6.617 \times 10^{-11}

Now calculate the square root:

\[

Thus, the time lost per second is approximately:

\[
1 - (1 - 3.3085 \times 10^{-11}) = 3.3085 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}
\]

Convert this to picoseconds (1 second = \(10^{12}\) picoseconds):

\[

The expected time lost per second due to special relativity is approximately 33.085 picoseconds. 

The measured result is \(-295.02 \pm 0.29 \, \text{ps/s}\), which includes a predicted effect due to general relativity of \(35.0 \pm 0.06 \, \text{ps/s}\).

716,,Consider a file with a size of 350 Kbytes storing in a web server. Client A sends a request to the server to retrieve the file from a remote location. It is known that the link capacity between client A and the server is 10 Mbps and the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is fixed at 20ms. Assume that the segment size is 20 Kbytes and the client has a receiver buffer of 200Kbytes. Assume that the window size (W) is fixed at 2. How long (in ms) does client A take to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request?,352,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for client A to receive the entire 350 Kbytes file from the server, given the constraints and parameters provided.

1. **Calculate the number of segments:**
   - File size = 350 Kbytes
   - Segment size = 20 Kbytes
   - Number of segments = 350 Kbytes / 20 Kbytes = 17.5 segments
   - Since we can't have half a segment, we round up to 18 segments.

2. **Calculate the time to send and receive segments:**
   - Link capacity = 10 Mbps = 10,000 Kbps
   - Time to send one segment (20 Kbytes) = (20 Kbytes * 8 bits/byte) / 10,000 Kbps = 16 ms

3. **Calculate the time for the entire transfer:**
   - RTT = 20 ms
   - Window size (W) = 2 segments
   - Each window transmission takes 2 * 16 ms = 32 ms
   - Each RTT allows for the transmission of 2 segments, so the time for one window (2 segments) is 32 ms + 20 ms (RTT) = 52 ms

4. **Calculate the total time for all segments:**
   - Total segments = 18
   - Number of full windows = 18 segments / 2 segments per window = 9 windows
   - Total time = 9 windows * 52 ms per window = 468 ms

Therefore, the total time for client A to receive the entire file is 468 ms.

\[
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV
\]

where \( V \) is the volume enclosed by the surface \( S \), and \( \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \) is the divergence of the vector field \( \vec{F} \).

Given the vector field \( \vec{F} = xy \vec{i} - \frac{1}{2}y^2\vec{j} + z\vec{k} \), we first calculate the divergence:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(-\frac{1}{2}y^2\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy) = y
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(-\frac{1}{2}y^2\right) = -y
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z) = 1
\]

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = y - y + 1 = 1
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence over the region \( V \). The region \( V \) is bounded by the paraboloid \( z = 4 - 3x^2 - 3y^2 \) and the plane \( z = 0 \).

The volume integral becomes:

\[
\iiint_V 1 \, dV = \text{Volume of } V
\]

The region \( V \) is a paraboloid with height 4 and base in the \( xy \)-plane. We can use cylindrical coordinates to evaluate the volume:

\[
z = 4 - 3r^2, \quad 0 \leq z \leq 4 - 3r^2, \quad 0 \leq r \leq \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}, \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi
\]

The volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} \int_0^{4 - 3r^2} r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):

\[
\int_0^{4 - 3r^2} dz = 4 - 3r^2
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):

\[
\int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} (4 - 3r^2) r \, dr = \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}} (4r - 3r^3) \, dr
\]

\[
= \left[ 2r^2 - \frac{3}{4}r^4 \right]_0^{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}}
\]

\[
= \left( 2\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) - \frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 \right)
\]

\[
= \left( \frac{8}{3} - \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{16}{9} \right)
\]

\[
= \left( \frac{8}{3} - \frac{4}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{4}{3} \, d\theta = \frac{4}{3} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{8\pi}{3}
\]

Thus, the flux through the surface \( S \) is:

\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{e^n} + \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \right)
\]

This can be split into two separate series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}
\]

**First Series:**

The first series is a geometric series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} = \frac{1/e}{1 - 1/e} = \frac{1/e}{(e-1)/e} = \frac{1}{e-1}
\]

**Second Series:**

The second series can be simplified using partial fraction decomposition:

\[
\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}
\]

Thus, the series becomes a telescoping series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right)
\]

The terms cancel out sequentially:

\[
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \cdots
\]

This results in:

\[
1
\]

**Final Sum:**

Adding the results of the two series:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} + 1
\]

Thus, the sum of the original series is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{e-1} + 1}
\]

To express this as a single number, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} + 1 \approx \frac{1}{1.71828} + 1 \approx 0.582 + 1 = 1.582
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\int_{-5}^{4} (2x - 4y^3) \, dx = \left[ x^2 - 4y^3x \right]_{-5}^{4}

1. Using the point (1, -1):

2. Using the point (2, 3):

3. Using the point (3, 13):
   \[

We now have the following system of equations:

1. & \quad a + b + c = -1 \\
2. & \quad a + 2b + 4c = 3 \\
3. & \quad a + 3b + 9c = 13

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:
\[

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:
\[
(a + 3b + 9c) - (a + 2b + 4c) = 13 - 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b + 5c = 10

Now, solve the two new equations:

Subtract the first from the second:

Substitute c = 3 into b + 3c = 4:

The derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( u \) is:

The derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( x \) is:

Calculate \( \frac{d}{dx}(1 + (1 + x)^2) \):

Where:
- \( S_0 \) is the current stock price ($100).
- \( X \) is the strike price ($98).
- \( r \) is the risk-free interest rate (0.055).
- \( \delta \) is the dividend yield (0.01).
- \( \sigma \) is the volatility (0.50).
- \( T \) is the time to expiration in years (0.5 years).
- \( N(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

First, calculate \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \):

\[ d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/X) + (r - \delta + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \]

\[ d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ d_1 = \frac{\ln(100/98) + (0.055 - 0.01 + \frac{0.50^2}{2}) \times 0.5}{0.50 \times \sqrt{0.5}} \]

\[ d_1 = \frac{0.0202027073 + 0.0425}{0.3535533906} \]

\[ d_1 = \frac{0.0627027073}{0.3535533906} \]

\[ d_1 \approx 0.1774 \]

Now calculate \( d_2 \):

\[ d_2 = 0.1774 - 0.50 \times \sqrt{0.5} \]

\[ d_2 = 0.1774 - 0.3535533906 \]

\[ d_2 \approx -0.1762 \]

Next, find \( N(-d_1) \) and \( N(-d_2) \) using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator:

\[ N(-d_1) \approx N(-0.1774) \approx 0.4292 \]

\[ N(-d_2) \approx N(0.1762) \approx 0.5708 \]

Now, substitute these into the put option formula:

\[ P = 98e^{-0.055 \times 0.5} \times 0.5708 - 100e^{-0.01 \times 0.5} \times 0.4292 \]

\[ P = 98 \times e^{-0.0275} \times 0.5708 - 100 \times e^{-0.005} \times 0.4292 \]

\[ P = 98 \times 0.9728 \times 0.5708 - 100 \times 0.9950 \times 0.4292 \]

(Unit: m/s^2))",12,"The acceleration of an object moving in a circle at constant speed is given by the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[ a = \frac{v^2}{r} \]

where \( v \) is the linear speed and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

First, we need to find the linear speed \( v \). The linear speed is the circumference of the circle divided by the time it takes to make one complete circle:

\[ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} \]

where \( T \) is the period (time for one complete circle).

Given:
- \( r = 5.0 \) m
- \( T = 4.0 \) s

Calculate \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{2\pi \times 5.0}{4.0} = \frac{10\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{2} \]

Now, calculate the acceleration \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{\left(\frac{5\pi}{2}\right)^2}{5.0} \]

\[ a = \frac{25\pi^2}{4 \times 5.0} \]

\[ a = \frac{25\pi^2}{20} \]

\[ a = \frac{5\pi^2}{4} \]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):

\[ a \approx \frac{5 \times (3.14159)^2}{4} \]

\[ a \approx \frac{5 \times 9.8696}{4} \]

\[ a \approx \frac{49.348}{4} \]

\[ a \approx 12.337 \]

The acceleration is approximately:

\[
n^2 + 4n + 3 = (n+1)(n+3)
\]

Thus, the series becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)}
\]

We can use partial fraction decomposition to express the general term:

\[
\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{A}{n+1} + \frac{B}{n+3}
\]

Multiplying through by the common denominator \((n+1)(n+3)\), we have:

\[
2 = A(n+3) + B(n+1)
\]

Expanding and combining like terms gives:

\[
2 = (A + B)n + (3A + B)
\]

By equating coefficients, we get the system of equations:

\[
A + B = 0
\]
\[
3A + B = 2
\]

Solving the first equation for \(B\), we have \(B = -A\). Substituting into the second equation:

\[
3A - A = 2 \implies 2A = 2 \implies A = 1
\]

Thus, \(B = -1\). The partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+3}
\]

The series now becomes a telescoping series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+3} \right)
\]

Writing out the first few terms, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} \right) + \cdots
\]

The series telescopes, and most terms cancel out. The remaining terms are:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the sum of the series is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Therefore, the sum of the series is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{6}}\).",False,,,,,

Euler's method formula is:
\[ y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \]
where \(f(x, y) = 3x + 4y\).

1. **Initial condition:**
   \[ x_0 = 0, \, y_0 = 0 \]

2. **Step 1:**
   \[ x_1 = x_0 + h = 0 + 0.25 = 0.25 \]
   \[ y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot f(x_0, y_0) = 0 + 0.25 \cdot (3 \cdot 0 + 4 \cdot 0) = 0 \]

   \[ y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot f(x_1, y_1) = 0 + 0.25 \cdot (3 \cdot 0.25 + 4 \cdot 0) = 0.25 \cdot 0.75 = 0.1875 \]

4. **Step 3:**
   \[ x_3 = x_2 + h = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 \]
   \[ y_3 = y_2 + h \cdot f(x_2, y_2) = 0.1875 + 0.25 \cdot (3 \cdot 0.5 + 4 \cdot 0.1875) \]
   \[ = 0.1875 + 0.25 \cdot (1.5 + 0.75) = 0.1875 + 0.25 \cdot 2.25 = 0.1875 + 0.5625 = 0.75 \]

   \[ y_4 = y_3 + h \cdot f(x_3, y_3) = 0.75 + 0.25 \cdot (3 \cdot 0.75 + 4 \cdot 0.75) \]

Note that all six sides of the box are included in $S$.",67.5,"To solve this problem, we will use the divergence theorem, which states:

\[
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV
\]

where \( V \) is the volume enclosed by the surface \( S \), and \( \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \) is the divergence of the vector field \( \vec{F} \).

Given the vector field:

\[
\vec{F} = \sin(\pi x) \vec{i} + (z y^3) \vec{j} + (z^2 + 4x) \vec{k}
\]

we first calculate the divergence \( \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \):

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\sin(\pi x)) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

1. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\sin(\pi x)) = \pi \cos(\pi x)\)
2. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (z y^3) = 3z y^2\)
3. \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (z^2 + 4x) = 2z\)

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \pi \cos(\pi x) + 3z y^2 + 2z
\]

Now, we integrate this divergence over the volume \( V \) of the box defined by \(-1 \le x \le 2\), \(0 \le y \le 1\), and \(1 \le z \le 4\):

\[
\iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \, dV = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} (\pi \cos(\pi x) + 3z y^2 + 2z) \, dz \, dy \, dx

We evaluate the integral term by term:

1. **Integrate \(\pi \cos(\pi x)\):**

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} \pi \cos(\pi x) \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} [\pi \cos(\pi x) \cdot (4 - 1)] \, dy \, dx = 3\pi \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \cos(\pi x) \, dy \, dx

\[

2. **Integrate \(3z y^2\):**

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 3z y^2 \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ \frac{3}{2} z^2 y^2 \right]_{1}^{4} \, dy \, dx

\[

\[

\]

3. **Integrate \(2z\):**

\[
\int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \int_{z=1}^{4} 2z \, dz \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=-1}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{1} \left[ z^2 \right]_{1}^{4} \, dy \, dx

\[
