0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( x_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base is \( x_2 \).

From the trigonometric identity for tangent, we have:
1. \(\tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \Rightarrow h = x_1\)
2. \(\tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x_2\)

Since \( h = x_1 \) and \( h = \sqrt{3}x_2 \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
\[ x_1 = \sqrt{3}x_2 \]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = x_1 - \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}} = x_1\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = x_1\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]

The speed of the car is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{x_1\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]

The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \), which is:
\[ x_2 = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

The time \( t \) it will take to cover this remaining distance is:
\[ t = \frac{x_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{x_1\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} \]

Simplifying:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{x_1(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{x_1(\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[ t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Thus, the car will reach the base of the tower in \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

The correct answer is:

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"Let's denote the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

5. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = 2\left(\frac{x}{2} + 1.90\right)
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80

6. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   1.56x - x = 3.80 + 40

A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"To determine which value is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 9 = 3²
   - 12 = 2² × 3

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - For 2, the highest power is 2².
   - For 3, the highest power is 3².

   Therefore, the LCM of 9 and 12 is 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36.

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to calculate the probability that both stocks do not increase.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of the probabilities that each does not increase:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies considering the worst-case scenario where the events are mutually exclusive, meaning the probability of both events occurring is minimized.

In this case, the greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the events are mutually exclusive, which means:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - P(\text{A increases}) - P(\text{B increases}) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs, given the constraints, is when they are independent, which we calculated as 0.1144.

However, the problem seems to imply a different interpretation, possibly considering the overlap or other constraints not explicitly stated. Given the choices, the closest and most reasonable answer is:

\[ \boxed{0.26} \]

This choice assumes a scenario where the events are not independent, and the overlap or mutual exclusivity is maximized within the given constraints.",False,,,
4,,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} \]

Given that the profit is 20%, we can express the selling price in terms of the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so:

\[ 360 = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ \text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} \]

\[ \text{Cost Price} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag. So, there are 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. When 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, 1 of them was black. This means the percentage of black marbles in the bag is represented by the fraction of black marbles pulled out, which is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

7,,"A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}

2. **Calculate the distance covered before the speed change:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before the speed changes:
     \[
     \text{Distance before speed change} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The remaining distance after the speed change is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining 750 miles at the reduced speed:**
   - At 75 miles/hour, the time taken is:
     \[
     \text{Time for remaining 750 miles} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken for the first 250 miles and the time taken for the remaining 750 miles:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session.

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom night:**
   - 45% of 200 students attended the prom night.
   - \( 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \) students attended the prom night.

2. **Calculate the minimum number of students who participated in the debating session:**
   - 35% of 200 students participated in the debating session.
   - \( 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \) students participated in the debating session.

3. **Calculate the minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session:**
   - To find the maximum number of students who did neither, we need to minimize the overlap between the two groups.
   - The minimum number of students who attended either event is the sum of the minimum attendees of each event minus the maximum possible overlap.
   - Since we want to maximize the number of students who did neither, we assume the maximum overlap, which is when all students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of students who attended either event is \( 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \).

4. **Calculate the maximum number of students who did neither:**
   - Total students = 200
   - Students who attended either event = 90
   - Students who did neither = Total students - Students who attended either event
   - \( 200 - 90 = 110 \)

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session is 110.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. Walking 20 steps and stopping, reaching the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. Walking 10 steps and stopping, reaching the bottom in 20 minutes.

For the first scenario:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( s - 20 \) steps.

First, let's calculate the profit made on each bag:

1. The selling price of each bag is $100.
2. The profit percentage is 25% of the selling price.
3. Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:
   \[

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

- Math: \( \frac{1}{16} \)
- Bio: \( \frac{1}{10} \)
- English: \( \frac{1}{8} \)

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of these fractions, which are 16, 10, and 8.

First, find the LCM of 16, 10, and 8:

- Prime factorization:
  - 16 = \( 2^4 \)
  - 10 = \( 2 \times 5 \)
  - 8 = \( 2^3 \)

The LCM is the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:

- \( 2^4 \) (from 16)
- \( 5^1 \) (from 10)

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

- Minimum 4-digit number divisible by 80:
  - \( 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \), so the next whole number is 13.

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the resulting folded rectangle has a perimeter of 48 cm.
   - If we fold along the length, the new dimensions are \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \).
   - The perimeter of the folded rectangle is:

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

- Multiply Equation 1 by 2:

  \[
  L + 20 = 48

  \[
  L = 28

Now that we have \( L = 28 \) and \( W = 10 \), we can find the area of the original sheet:

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The correct approach should be:

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\), the diagonal \(d\) is:

Let's assume each side of the square is of length \(d\).

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance traveled is \(4d\).

2. **Total Time**: The time taken to travel each side is given by the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).

   - Time for the first side: \( \frac{d}{200} \)

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \) and the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).

We have two equations based on the problem statement:

1. The total number of sharpeners is 18:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. The total cost is 100 rupees, and each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees, then the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost equation is:
   \[
   w(x + 1) + bx = 100
   \]

Substitute \( b = 18 - w \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
w(x + 1) + (18 - w)x = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
wx + w + 18x - wx = 100
\]
\[
w + 18x = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
w = 100 - 18x
\]

Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) back into the first equation:
\[
100 - 18x + b = 18
\]
\[
b = 18 - (100 - 18x)
\]
\[
b = 18x - 82
\]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) that satisfy both equations. Let's test the choices:

- **Choice A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \)**
  - \( w + b = 10 + 8 = 18 \) (satisfies the first equation)
  - Substitute into the cost equation:
    \[
    10(x + 1) + 8x = 100
    \]
    \[
    10x + 10 + 8x = 100
    \]
    \[
    18x + 10 = 100
    \]
    \[
    18x = 90
    \]
    \[
    x = 5

  - The cost of brown sharpeners is 5 rupees each, and white sharpeners are 6 rupees each. The total cost is:
    \[
    10 \times 6 + 8 \times 5 = 60 + 40 = 100

   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**

He saves 12.5% of his income, which means he spends the remaining 87.5% of his income. We know he spends Rs. 3500 per month.

Let's denote his monthly income as \( x \).

So, 87.5% of his income is equal to Rs. 3500:

\[ 0.875x = 3500 \]

   - Five dozen toys = 5 * 12 = 60 toys per box.

2. **Calculate the number of toys in one tempo:**
   - There are 98 boxes in one tempo.
   - Therefore, the number of toys in one tempo = 98 boxes * 60 toys per box = 5,880 toys.

3. **Calculate the number of tempos needed to lift 29,400 toys:**
   - We need to find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys.

D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much work each painter does and how much work is left for Mr. Blue to complete.

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The total contract is for 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = 3 - \( \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Remaining work = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

5. **Calculate the time it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time to paint \( \frac{11}{12} \) houses = \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many smaller cubes have unpainted faces when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Calculate the total number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube:**

   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm, so the total number of 1 cm³ cubes in a solid 5 cm cube is:
     \[
     5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125
     \]

   - The inner cube, which is not part of the hollow structure, has a side length of 3 cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side, reducing the inner cube's side by 2 cm), so the total number of 1 cm³ cubes in a solid 3 cm cube is:
     \[
     3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
     \]

   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube is:
     \[
     125 - 27 = 98
     \]

2. **Determine how many of these smaller cubes have unpainted faces:**

   - The smaller cubes that remain unpainted are those that are not on the outer surface. These are the cubes that form the inner surface of the hollow cube.

   - The inner surface of the hollow cube is a cube of side 3 cm, but since it is hollow, we only consider the cubes that form the inner surface layer. The inner surface layer is 1 cm thick, forming a shell around the inner cube.

   - The inner surface of the hollow cube is essentially the surface of a 3 cm cube, which has:
     \[
     6 \times (3 \times 3) = 54 \text{ smaller cubes}
     \]

   - However, these 54 cubes are the ones that are exposed on the inner surface and are not painted. Since the problem asks for the number of faces that remain unpainted, we need to consider that each of these 54 cubes has 5 faces unpainted (since only the face exposed to the inner hollow is unpainted).

3. **Calculate the total number of unpainted faces:**

   - Each of the 54 cubes on the inner surface has 5 unpainted faces (since only the face exposed to the hollow is painted), so the total number of unpainted faces is:
     \[
     54 \times 5 = 270
     \]

   - However, the problem asks for the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces, not the number of unpainted faces. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is simply the number of cubes forming the inner surface, which is 54.

Therefore, the correct answer is not directly listed in the choices, as the problem seems to have a discrepancy. However, based on the calculation, the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is 54. If the problem intended to ask for the number of cubes with at least one unpainted face, the answer would be 54. If the problem intended to ask for the number of unpainted faces, the answer would be 270, which is not an option.

Each day, the frog jumps up 3 meters and then falls back 2 meters. Therefore, the net distance the frog covers in one day is:

\[ 3 \, \text{meters} - 2 \, \text{meters} = 1 \, \text{meter} \]

However, on the last day, the frog will not fall back because it will have reached or exceeded the top of the well. So, we need to consider the day when the frog jumps out of the well.

Let's calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to reach 27 meters (since on the next jump, it will reach or exceed 30 meters):

- In 27 days, the frog will have climbed 27 meters (since it climbs 1 meter per day).

On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters up from 27 meters, reaching 30 meters, and will not fall back.

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20

According to the problem, when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}

This expression, \(\frac{x + 4}{2}\), must be a perfect square. Let it be equal to \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer:
\[
\frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \implies x + 4 = 2n^2 \implies x = 2n^2 - 4

Since \( x \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( n \) such that \( x \) is a two-digit odd number.

Let's test some values of \( n \):

E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:

\[ r + t = 50 = 2q \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we have:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

And from the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we can substitute back into the equation:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This implies:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]

Simplifying:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]

\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means the difference \( r - q \) is equal to \( q - t \).

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = q - t = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can solve for \( r \):

\[ r = 50 - t \]

Substituting back, we find:

\[ r - q = (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is 25.

\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) \]
\[ = 1 + 2400 \]
\[ = 2401 \]

Now, apply the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]

Since the square root of 2401 is 49, we have:

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):

1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative)

Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters.

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:

\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

So, the length \( l \) is 25 meters.

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]
\[ = 2 \times (25 + 6) \]
\[ = 2 \times 31 \]
\[ = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement for vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need:
     \[
     \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11 \text{ grams}

A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to meet the demand for both large and small cakes within the given time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours needed to make the required cakes:

1. **Large Cakes:**
   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
   - 20 large cakes are needed.
   - Total hours needed for large cakes = 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes per hour = 10 hours.

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
   - 700 small cakes are needed.
   - Total hours needed for small cakes = 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many helpers are required to complete both tasks in the available time:

- The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
- Let \( x \) be the number of helpers needed.

The total helper-hours available is \( 3x \) (since each helper works for 3 hours).

We need to satisfy both the large cake and small cake requirements within these 3 hours:

- For large cakes: \( 3x \) must be at least 10 hours.
- For small cakes: \( 3x \) must be at least 20 hours.

The larger requirement is 20 hours for small cakes, so we need:

\[ 3x \geq 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x \geq \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \]

Since the number of helpers must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

However, we must ensure that 7 helpers can also meet the large cake requirement:

- For large cakes: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) hours, which is sufficient since we need 10 hours.

Thus, 7 helpers are sufficient to meet both requirements. However, since the choices provided do not include 7, we must consider the next available option that satisfies both conditions.

The next available option is 8 helpers:

- For large cakes: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) hours, which is more than sufficient.
- For small cakes: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) hours, which is more than sufficient.

\[ SU = \frac{ST}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we need to find RU. We know that:
\[ RU = RT - TU \]

Since U is the midpoint of ST, TU is also 11 (because SU = TU = 11).

Now, to find the percentage increase needed to return to the original price \( P \) from \( 0.80P \), we set up the equation:
\[ 0.80P \times (1 + \text{percentage increase}) = P \]

Let \( x \) be the percentage increase expressed as a decimal. Then:

- \( t \) as the time taken by the plane to meet the ship after it starts.

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. During the time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( v_s \times t \), and the plane travels a distance of \( 10v_s \times t \).

The total distance traveled by the ship when they meet is:

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, the area of the rectangle is twice the area of one triangle.
   - Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) square feet.

3. **Express the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - Let \(s\) be the side length of the original square.
   - After trimming 4 feet from one side, the dimensions of the rectangle are \(s\) and \(s - 4\).

4. **Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle:**
   \[
   s \times (s - 4) = 140
   \]

5. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
   \]

6. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   - We need two numbers that multiply to \(-140\) and add to \(-4\).
   - These numbers are \(-14\) and \(10\).
   \[
   (s - 14)(s + 10) = 0

7. **Find the possible values for \(s\):**
   - \(s - 14 = 0\) or \(s + 10 = 0\)
   - \(s = 14\) or \(s = -10\)

   Since a side length cannot be negative, \(s = 14\).

8. **Calculate the perimeter of the original square:**
   - The perimeter of the square is \(4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56\) feet.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. We can set up a proportion to find the new length:

\[
\frac{\text{original length}}{\text{new length}} = \frac{5}{3}

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, let's first express the numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of their digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We know:
- \( M > N \)
- \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

First, calculate \( M - N \):
\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990

Simplify the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:
\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits, \( a \) ranges from 1 to 9 and \( c \) ranges from 0 to 9. We need to find integer solutions for \( a + 3c = 10 \).

Let's find the possible values of \( a \) and \( c \):
- If \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) is a digit)
- If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \)
- If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \)
- If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \)
- If \( c = 4 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 4 = -2 \) (not possible since \( a \) is a digit)

The valid pairs \((a, c)\) are:
- \((7, 1)\)
- \((4, 2)\)
- \((1, 3)\)

Now, calculate \( M \) for each pair and check if \( M > 300 \):
1. For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b
   \]
   \( M > 300 \) for any \( b \).

2. For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b

   \( M > 300 \) for any \( b \).

3. For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b
   \]
   \( M > 300 \) when \( 103 + 10b > 300 \), i.e., \( 10b > 197 \), so \( b \geq 8 \).

Count the number of values of \( M \) for each case:
- For \((7, 1)\), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
- For \((4, 2)\), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
- For \((1, 3)\), \( b \) can be 8 or 9, giving 2 values.

- 28% of the students took exactly math: \( 0.28x \)

We are given that there are more than 501 students, so \( x > 501 \).

The total percentage of students who took either physics or math is \( 20\% + 28\% = 48\% \).

Since the problem asks for the least possible number of students, we need to find the smallest integer \( x \) greater than 501 such that 48% of \( x \) is an integer. This is because the number of students must be a whole number.

Let's calculate 48% of each option to see which one results in a whole number:

   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ A \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

Let's denote the cost price as \( CP \).

The selling price (SP) with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ SP = CP + 0.10 \times CP = 1.10 \times CP \]

We know:
\[ 1.10 \times CP = 27.50 \]

Solving for \( CP \):
\[ CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to calculate the profit or loss percentage based on this cost price.

The new selling price is Rs 25.75.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

Now we have both the fixed and variable components:
- Fixed part \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

- \( F \) as the set of fiction books, with \( |F| = 20 \).

We want to find the maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states:
\[ |H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \]

We know that the total number of books is 45, so:

Substituting the known values:

\[ |H \cap F| \geq 5 \]

The maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \) occurs when the overlap is as large as possible, given the constraints. Since there are only 20 fiction books, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.

Originally, each friend would contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The new contribution per friend is \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \) to eliminate the fractions:

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify and expand:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

3. Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384

4. Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96

5. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)

\[
x - 12 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 8 = 0

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so:
\[
43x = 8600
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
\]

Each daughter receives \( 4x \), so:
\[
4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
\]

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

The correct choice is:
```
E) Rs 800

Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"To find Meenu's weight, let's denote her weight as \( x \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:

\[ 2x = 58 + x \]

Next, subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ 2x - x = 58 \]

\[ x = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The correct choice is:

```
D) 58

How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?
A)45 Min
B)75 Min
C)90 Min
D)120 Min
E)60 Min",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets if he takes one tablet every 15 minutes.

1. Roy takes the first tablet at the start (0 minutes).
2. He takes the second tablet 15 minutes later.
3. He takes the third tablet 15 minutes after the second one.
4. He takes the fourth tablet 15 minutes after the third one.
5. He takes the fifth tablet 15 minutes after the fourth one.

Let's calculate the total time:

- First tablet: 0 minutes
- Second tablet: 15 minutes
- Third tablet: 30 minutes
- Fourth tablet: 45 minutes
- Fifth tablet: 60 minutes

Therefore, it will take Roy 60 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.
