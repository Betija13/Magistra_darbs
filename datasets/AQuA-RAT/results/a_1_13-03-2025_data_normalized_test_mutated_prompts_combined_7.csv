0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the tower.
   - Initially, the angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower is 45°.
   - After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation changes to 60°.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower be \( d_1 \) when the angle is 45°.
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower be \( d_2 \) when the angle is 60°.

3. **Setting up the Equations:**
   - At 45°, \( \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \) implies \( h = d_1 \).
   - At 60°, \( \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \) implies \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \).

4. **Relating the Distances:**
   - From \( h = d_1 \) and \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \), we equate to get \( d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3} \).

5. **Finding the Distance Traveled:**
   - The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance traveled in 10 minutes is \( d_1 - d_2 = d_2 \sqrt{3} - d_2 = d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \).

6. **Finding the Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( d_2 \).

7. **Calculating the Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The speed of the car is \( \frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \).
   - Time to travel the remaining distance \( d_2 \) is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{d_2}{\frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

8. **Simplifying the Time Expression:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
     \]

Therefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Relate to the condition given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8

B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

First, let's define the events:
- Let \( P(A) \) be the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is 0.56.
- Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is 0.74.

The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is the complement of the probability that at least one of them will increase in value. 

The probability that at least one of the stocks will increase in value is given by:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

The probability that neither stock will increase is:
\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - P(A \cup B) \]

To maximize \( P(\text{neither A nor B}) \), we need to minimize \( P(A \cup B) \). The minimum value of \( P(A \cup B) \) occurs when \( P(A \cap B) \) is maximized. The maximum value of \( P(A \cap B) \) is the minimum of \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), which is 0.56.

Thus, the minimum value of \( P(A \cup B) \) is:
\[ P(A \cup B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74 \]

Therefore, the greatest probability that neither stock will increase is:

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price is 120% of the cost price because the trader sold it at a profit of 20%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( CP \).

According to the problem, the selling price (SP) is Rs.360, and this is 120% of the cost price. We can express this relationship as:

\[ SP = \frac{120}{100} \times CP \]

Substituting the given selling price:

\[ 360 = \frac{120}{100} \times CP \]

To find the cost price, we solve for \( CP \):

\[ CP = \frac{360 \times 100}{120} \]

\[ CP = \frac{36000}{120} \]

\[ CP = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - 20 marbles were painted black and returned to the bag. 
   - When 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, 1 of them was black.

2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of black marbles in the second draw is \(\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

3. **Relating Percentage to Total**:
   - If 5% of the marbles are black, and there are 20 black marbles in total (since all painted marbles were returned), then 5% of \( Q \) is 20.

4. **Equation Setup**:
   - We set up the equation: \( 0.05 \times Q = 20 \).

5. **Solve for \( Q \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for \( Q \):

D)65000
E)97656",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The problem does not specify that the letters need to be distinct, so we will assume that they do not need to be distinct.

1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose the letters:**
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
   - Since the letters do not need to be distinct, for each of the 2 positions, we can choose any of the 26 letters.
   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose the 2 letters is \(26 \times 26 = 676\).

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose the numbers:**

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered before the speed change:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before the speed change:**
   - At 100 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 250 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The remaining distance after the rain starts is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time before and after the rain:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

E)280",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

1. **Calculate the total yearly production cost:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Total production cost per month = 420 units * $110 = $46,200.
   - Total production cost per year = $46,200 * 12 months = $554,400.

2. **Determine the required yearly revenue for the desired profit:**
   - Desired yearly profit = $626,400.
   - Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost = Yearly profit.
   - Yearly revenue = Yearly profit + Yearly production cost.
   - Yearly revenue = $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,080,800.

3. **Calculate the minimum selling price per component:**
   - Total units produced and sold per year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.
   - Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Total units.
   - Minimum selling price per component = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.68.

First, let's find the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:
- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate is 1/6 yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate is 1/9 yo-yos per minute.

The combined rate of both machines is the sum of their individual rates:
Combined rate = (1/6) + (1/9) yo-yos per minute.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18.

Convert the rates to have a common denominator:
- (1/6) = 3/18
- (1/9) = 2/18

Now add the rates:
Combined rate = (3/18) + (2/18) = 5/18 yo-yos per minute.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate.

Let t be the time in minutes. The equation is:

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. **First Scenario:**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - It takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - You walk 10 steps and then stop.
   - It takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom.

**First Scenario Analysis:**

- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

This gives us the equation:
\[ S - 20 = 10v \]

**Second Scenario Analysis:**

- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

This gives us the equation:
\[ S - 10 = 20v \]

**Solving the Equations:**

We have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v \]

20,,"A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?
A)12
B)16
C)24
D)30
E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

1. **Understand the profit per bag**: 
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.
   - Therefore, the profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25.

2. **Calculate the number of bags sold**:
   - The total profit made is $3,000.
   - If the profit per bag is $25, then the number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag = $3,000 / $25.

3. **Perform the division**:
   - $3,000 / $25 = 120.

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

However, the options provided do not include 120, which suggests a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the profit calculation:

- The problem states a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the cost price is 75% of the selling price.
- If the selling price is $100, the cost price is 75% of $100 = $75.
- The profit per bag is $100 - $75 = $25, which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

Given the options, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or error in the problem setup or options. However, based on the calculations, the grocer sold 120 bags, which is not listed in the options. 

Since the options do not match the calculated result, the closest logical step is to choose the option that aligns with the problem's setup, but given the calculations, none of the options are correct. 

However, since we must choose an option, and considering the problem's setup, the closest option that might have been intended (if there was a misprint or misunderstanding) is:

21,,"Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the equation:
\[ A + J = 35 \]

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, express \( A \) in terms of \( J \) from the first equation:
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the second equation:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Expanding the equation gives:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]

Solve for \( J \):
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be an integer, and the options are given as integers, we round 15.3125 to the nearest integer, which is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys made by Jacob is closest to 15.

B)42%
C)39.86%
D)22.35%

1. **Initial Concentration**: The initial concentration of tea is 50%.

2. **First Replacement**: John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. This means 85% of the original solution remains, and 15% is replaced with milk (which has 0% tea concentration).

   New concentration after first replacement:
   \[
   \text{New concentration} = 0.85 \times 50\% = 42.5\%
   \]

3. **Second Replacement**: Again, John replaces 15% of the new solution with milk. So, 85% of the current solution remains, and 15% is replaced with milk.

   New concentration after second replacement:
   \[
   \text{New concentration} = 0.85 \times 42.5\% = 36.125\%

4. **Third Replacement**: Finally, John replaces 10% of the current solution with milk. So, 90% of the current solution remains, and 10% is replaced with milk.

   New concentration after third replacement:
   \[
   \text{New concentration} = 0.90 \times 36.125\% = 32.5125\%

6. **Calculating the Maximum and Minimum \( N \):**
   - Minimum \( N \) occurs when \( k = 13 \): \( N = 80 \times 13 = 1040 \).
   - Maximum \( N \) occurs when \( k = 124 \): \( N = 80 \times 124 = 9920 \).

7. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

3. **Second Movement (East 5 km):** Moving east increases the x-coordinate by 5. So, the new position is (5, -3).

4. **Third Movement (North 3 km):** Moving north increases the y-coordinate by 3. So, the new position is (5, 0).

5. **Fourth Movement (West 2 km):** Moving west decreases the x-coordinate by 2. So, the final position is (3, 0).

Now, we need to calculate the distance from the final position (3, 0) back to the origin (0, 0). The distance can be calculated using the distance formula for two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3

1. When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is \( 0.95M \).
2. When the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is \( 0.93M \).

The difference in profit between giving a 5% discount and a 7% discount is Rs. 15. This means:

\[

37,,"A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
A)1584
B)2520
C)1728
D)1656
E)None",A,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number as \( x \).

1. The correct calculation should have been \( \frac{7}{8} \times x \).
2. The student incorrectly calculated \( \frac{7}{18} \times x \).
3. The difference between the correct calculation and the student's calculation is 770.

We can set up the equation based on the difference:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
\]

To solve for \( x \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

Convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{72} = \frac{63}{72}

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{63 - 28}{72}x = 770

Substitute \( S = 1500 \) into the equation:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the term with sales:
\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Now, solve for Sales by dividing both sides by 0.05:

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. **Total Distance:**
   Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, and each side is equal, let's assume each side of the square is \(d\) km. Therefore, the total distance traveled is:
   \[
   4d
   \]

2. **Total Time:**
   The time taken to travel each side is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{200}\)
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{400}\)
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{600}\)
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{800}\)

4. **Average Speed:**
   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}} = \frac{4d \times 2400}{25d} = \frac{9600}{25} = 384

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Since \( x + y = 18 \), we can substitute \( y = 18 - x \) into the equation:

\[ xb + x + (18 - x)b = 100 \]

\[ xb + x + 18b - xb = 100 \]

\[ x + 18b = 100 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( x + 18b = 100 \)

From the second equation, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into the first equation:

\[ 100 - 18b + y = 18 \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find a value of \( b \) such that both \( x = 100 - 18b \) and \( y = 18b - 82 \) are non-negative integers.

Let's test the options:

- If \( b = 5 \):
  - \( x = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - \( y = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 8 \)

This gives us \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 8 \), which satisfies \( x + y = 18 \).

A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

D)150
E)180",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a total of 10 oranges. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked.

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Determine the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Determine the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - The contract is for 3 houses, so the remaining work is \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Remaining work = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate the time it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time required = \( \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{Mr. Blue's rate}} = \frac{\frac{11}{12}}{\frac{1}{12}} = 11 \) days.

56,,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understand the structure of the hollow cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of 3 cm (since 5 cm - 2*1 cm = 3 cm).

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube (5 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) is also made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so it contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Determine the number of smaller cubes that form the shell:**
   - The shell of the hollow cube is the outer cube minus the inner hollow part.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the shell is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The smaller cubes that form the shell have some faces painted and some unpainted.
   - The inner faces of the shell (facing the hollow part) are unpainted.
   - The inner surface of the hollow cube is a 3 cm cube, which has \(3 \times 3 \times 6 = 54\) faces (since each face of the 3 cm cube has 9 smaller cubes, and there are 6 faces).

5. **Calculate the total number of unpainted faces:**
   - The unpainted faces are the inner faces of the shell, which are the same as the inner surface of the hollow cube.
   - Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 54.

However, the question asks for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, not just the inner surface. We need to consider the total number of faces of all smaller cubes and subtract the painted ones.

6. **Calculate the total number of faces of all smaller cubes:**
   - There are 125 smaller cubes, each with 6 faces, so there are \(125 \times 6 = 750\) faces in total.

7. **Calculate the number of painted faces:**
   - The outer surface of the 5 cm cube is painted, which has \(5 \times 5 \times 6 = 150\) faces.

8. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:**
   - The number of unpainted faces is the total number of faces minus the painted faces: \(750 - 150 = 600\).

However, this seems incorrect based on the options provided. Let's re-evaluate:

- The inner surface of the hollow cube (3 cm) has 54 faces, which are unpainted.
- The total number of unpainted faces should be the total faces minus the painted ones, considering the hollow nature.

Re-evaluating, the correct number of unpainted faces, considering the hollow structure and the options given, should be:

E)1000",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the class. Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \).

1. According to the problem, 8% of the students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).

2. 4/5 of the students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).

3. 10% of the students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

4. The problem states that 20 students are not interested in any games.

Since all students either have an interest in one of the games or no interest at all, we can write the equation:
\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x

5. Simplify the equation:
   - Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal: \(\frac{4}{5} = 0.80\).
   - The equation becomes:
   \[
   0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x

6. Combine like terms:
   \[
   0.98x + 20 = x

7. Subtract \(0.98x\) from both sides to isolate the constant:
   \[
   20 = x - 0.98x

1. **Initial Charge**: The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. This means that after the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left to spend.

2. **Additional Charge**: The cab charges 10 cents ($0.10) for each additional quarter-mile. 

3. **Calculate Additional Distance**: With the remaining $5.00, we need to calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can travel. 

   - Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10.
   - Therefore, with $5.00, you can travel $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

4. **Total Distance**: 
   - The first quarter-mile is already covered by the initial $3.50.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total number of runs scored before the finals.

Given:
- Sachin's current batting average is 51, so \( \frac{y}{x} = 51 \).
- In the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54.

After the finals, the total number of matches played is \( x + 1 \), and the total number of runs scored is \( y + 78 \).

The new batting average is given by:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can represent \( n \) types of books.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book. The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes**: The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of the single letter codes and the pair of letters codes:

9. Since RU = RS + SU, we have:
   RU = 5 + 11 = 16.

10. This calculation seems incorrect based on the options provided. Let's consider the positioning of the points:

11. If R, S, T are on a line with U as the midpoint of ST, and RS = 5, ST = 22, then:
    RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16.

12. However, the options do not include 16, indicating a possible misinterpretation of the problem setup.

13. Let's consider the possibility of RU being calculated differently:
    Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, we have:
    SU = 11 and UT = 11.

14. If we consider the line as R - S - U - T, then:
    RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16.

15. The correct interpretation should be:

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

1. **Establish the relationship between pita breads and rolls:**
   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads.

2. **Establish the relationship between rolls and baguettes:**
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

3. **Combine the relationships:**
   - From step 1, 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
   - From step 2, 1 roll = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.
   - Therefore, 3 pita breads = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

4. **Find the relationship between pita breads and baguettes:**
   - From the above, 1 pita bread = \( \frac{5}{9} \) baguettes (since 3 pita breads = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes, divide both sides by 3).

5. **Determine how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes:**
   - 1 baguette = \( \frac{9}{5} \) pita breads (since 1 pita bread = \( \frac{5}{9} \) baguettes, take the reciprocal).
   - Therefore, 2 baguettes = \( 2 \times \frac{9}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \) pita breads.

Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \( \frac{18}{5} \) pita breads.

E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is $100.

1. The shopkeeper gives a 20% discount on the original price. 
   - Discounted price = Original price - (20% of Original price)
   - Discounted price = $100 - (0.20 * $100) = $100 - $20 = $80

2. Now, the shopkeeper wants to return to the original price of $100 from the discounted price of $80. We need to find the percentage increase from $80 to $100.

3. The increase in price needed is $100 - $80 = $20.

4. To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
   - Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original discounted price) * 100

1. **Width of the Pickets:**
   - Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
   - For x pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Spaces Between Pickets:**
   - There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
- \( 10s \) as the speed of the plane in miles per hour (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts. We need to find the time it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship after the plane starts.

During this time \( t \):
- The ship travels an additional distance of \( s \times t \) miles.
- The plane travels a distance of \( 10s \times t \) miles.

Since the plane catches up with the ship, the total distance traveled by the plane equals the total distance traveled by the ship. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 180 + s \times t = 10s \times t \]

Solving for \( t \), we get:

\[ 180 = 10s \times t - s \times t \]
\[ 180 = 9s \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9s} \]
\[ t = \frac{20}{s} \]

Now, we calculate the distance from the starting point when they meet. The ship has traveled for a total time of \( t + \frac{180}{s} \) hours (since it traveled 180 miles before the plane started).

The total distance traveled by the ship is:

\[ \text{Distance} = s \times \left( \frac{20}{s} + \frac{180}{s} \right) \]
\[ \text{Distance} = s \times \left( \frac{200}{s} \right) \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 200 \]

A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of proportions. The problem states that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of these were tagged. We are to assume that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

First, we calculate the proportion of tagged deer in the sample:
\[
\text{Proportion of tagged deer in sample} = \frac{\text{Number of tagged deer in sample}}{\text{Total number of deer in sample}} = \frac{20}{500} = \frac{1}{25}
\]

This proportion is assumed to be the same for the entire population. Let \( N \) be the total deer population in the forest. The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is:
\[
\text{Proportion of tagged deer in population} = \frac{\text{Number of tagged deer in population}}{\text{Total deer population}} = \frac{300}{N}
\]

Since these proportions are equal, we set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{1}{25} = \frac{300}{N}
\]

To solve for \( N \), we cross-multiply:
\[
1 \times N = 25 \times 300

\[
N = 7500

1. **Understanding the Train Schedules:**
   - The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M. So, the trains arrive at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, etc.
   - The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M. So, the trains arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population one year from now will be:
\[ P \times 1.10 \]

The population two years from now will be:
\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):
\[ 1.21 = 2 \]

This equation is not correct, which means we need to adjust our understanding. The population two years from now should be double the population of one year ago, so let's denote the population one year ago as \( P_0 \), the population now as \( P_1 \), and the population two years from now as \( P_2 \).

Given:
\[ P_2 = 2 \times P_0 \]

We know:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P_1 \times 1.21 \]

And:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + x) \]

Where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year.

Substituting \( P_1 \) in the equation for \( P_2 \):
\[ P_0 \times (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_0 \]

Cancel \( P_0 \) from both sides:
\[ (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \]

\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]  (Equation 1)

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles, each with legs \( s \) and \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**
   - The area of one triangle is given by the formula for the area of a right triangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4)
     \]
   - We know the area of each triangle is 70 square feet:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140

     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We solve the quadratic equation \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576

   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Substitute into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two solutions: \( s = 14 \) and \( s = -10 \).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

5. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

   - M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a)
   - M - N = 99a - 99c
   - M - N = 99(a - c)

4. **Substitute M - N in the equation:**
   - 99(a - c) + 396c = 990

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - 99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   - 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   - 99a + 297c = 990

6. **Divide the entire equation by 99:**
   - a + 3c = 10

7. **Find possible values for a and c:**
   - Since a is a digit (1 to 9) and c is a digit (0 to 9), we solve for a and c:
   - a = 10 - 3c

8. **Check valid digit values:**
   - c = 0, a = 10 (not valid since a must be a digit)
   - c = 1, a = 7 (valid)
   - c = 2, a = 4 (valid)
   - c = 3, a = 1 (valid)
   - c = 4, a = -2 (not valid)

9. **Valid pairs (a, c):**
   - (7, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3)

10. **Calculate M for each valid pair:**
    - For (7, 1): M = 100(7) + 10b + 1 = 700 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b
    - For (4, 2): M = 100(4) + 10b + 2 = 400 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b
    - For (1, 3): M = 100(1) + 10b + 3 = 100 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b

11. **Count values of M > 300:**
    - For (7, 1): M = 701 + 10b, all values are > 300 (b = 0 to 9), 10 values
    - For (4, 2): M = 402 + 10b, all values are > 300 (b = 0 to 9), 10 values
    - For (1, 3): M = 103 + 10b, no values are > 300

12. **Total values of M > 300:**
    - 10 (from 7, 1) + 10 (from 4, 2) = 20

Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 20.

A)550
B)570
C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of students in the school that satisfies the given conditions.

1. Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school.
2. We know that 20% of the students took only physics, so the number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \).
3. Similarly, 28% of the students took only math, so the number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).
4. We are given that there are more than 501 students, so \( N > 501 \).

We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) that satisfies these conditions and is one of the given choices.

Since \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) must both be integers, \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of 0.2 and 0.28, which are 5 and 25 respectively. The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

Now, we check the given choices to find the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501:

- 550 is a multiple of 25 and greater than 501.
- 570 is not a multiple of 25.
- 600 is a multiple of 25 and greater than 501.
- 700 is a multiple of 25 and greater than 501.

Among these, 550 is the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

1. **Understand the relationship 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \( R - 5 \), where \( R \) is Rahim's current age.
   - Raj's age 5 years ago was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, 5 years ago, Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{3}(R - 5)

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     36 = R - 5

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then divide that by the area the cow grazes per day to find the total number of days.

1. **Calculate the total grazing area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - Substituting the radius, \( r = 14 \) feet, we get:
     \[
     A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
     \]
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days to graze the entire area:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
   - To find the number of days \( D \) it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the area grazed per day:
     \[
     D = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544
     \]
   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since the options provided are in increments of 10, we choose the closest option, which is 61.

Therefore, the approximate time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price:**
   - The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%.
   - Let the cost price be \( C \).
   - Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (C) + Profit
   - Profit = 10% of Cost Price = 0.10 * C
   - Therefore, SP = C + 0.10 * C = 1.10 * C
   - Given SP = Rs. 27.50, we have:
     \[
     1.10 \times C = 27.50
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**
   - New Selling Price = Rs. 25.75
   - Cost Price = Rs. 25.00
   - Profit or Loss = New Selling Price - Cost Price = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
   - Since the result is positive, it is a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**
   - Profit Percentage = \(\left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100\)
   - Profit Percentage = \(\left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 = 3\%\)

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.

E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) in a line such that Susan is to the left of Tim.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the number of permutations is given by 3! (3 factorial), which is:

3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Since these two possibilities are equally likely, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, we divide the total number of arrangements by 2:

Number of arrangements with Susan to the left of Tim = 6 / 2 = 3

Thus, there are 3 ways to arrange the children such that Susan is to the left of Tim.

91,,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the total bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the total bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we know:
- The fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- The variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For the month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500
\]
\[
= 1680

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls is Rs.1680.

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after starting together. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, we calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Next, we find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Now, we convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes = 1 hour, 91 - 60 = 31 minutes).

Thus, the answer is 1 hour and 31 minutes.

The maximum overlap occurs when the number of hardcover fiction books is as large as possible. This happens when every fiction book is also a hardcover book. Therefore, the maximum number of hardcover fiction books is the minimum of the number of hardcover books and the number of fiction books.

So, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is the minimum of 30 (hardcover) and 20 (fiction), which is 20.

B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular weekday (Monday through Saturday) as \( x \).

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The cost for newspapers on a regular weekday is $1 per newspaper, so the cost for newspapers from Monday to Saturday is:
\[ 6x \times 1 = 6x \]

The cost for newspapers on Sunday is $4 per newspaper, so the cost for newspapers on Sunday is:
\[ 2x \times 4 = 8x \]

The total cost for the week is given as $210, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 6x + 8x = 210 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 14x = 210 \]

Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 14:

B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, let's define some variables and set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic. Each friend was supposed to contribute equally to the total cost of Rs. 96. Therefore, the contribution per person initially would be \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is \( x - 4 \). The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so their new contribution per person is \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

Simplify and expand the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives two potential solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

\[
x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we discard \( x = -8 \).

Thus, the original number of friends was 12. Since 4 did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
