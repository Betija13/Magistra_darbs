0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of uniform speed.

1. **Initial Position (Angle of Elevation = 45°):**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - At 45°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \( h \) (since \(\tan 45° = 1\)).

2. **Position after 10 minutes (Angle of Elevation = 60°):**
   - At 60°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \( \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \) (since \(\tan 60° = \sqrt{3}\)).

3. **Distance Covered in 10 Minutes:**
   - Initial distance = \( h \)
   - Final distance = \( \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \)
   - Distance covered = \( h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}) \)

4. **Speed of the Car:**
   - Speed = Distance/Time = \( \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\sqrt{3}} \)

5. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - Remaining distance to cover = \( \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \)
   - Time = Distance/Speed = \( \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\sqrt{3}}} \)
   - Simplifying, Time = \( \frac{10\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \)

6. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{3} + 1\):
   - Time = \( \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \)

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price (SP) is 120% of the cost price (CP) because the trader sold it at a profit of 20%.

Given:
- Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 360
- Profit = 20%

The formula for selling price in terms of cost price and profit percentage is:
\[ SP = CP \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Profit Percentage}}{100}\right) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ 360 = CP \times \left(1 + \frac{20}{100}\right) \]
\[ 360 = CP \times 1.2 \]

To find the cost price (CP), divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ CP = \frac{360}{1.2} \]

Calculate:
\[ CP = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

A)4,000
B)4,200

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. 10% of the staplers were defective, so the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).

3. The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

4. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

5. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   0.018x = 72
   \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[

1. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold this year = 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

3. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22-month period:
   - Total sold over 22 months = Total sold last year + Total sold this year = 504 ovens + 200 ovens = 704 ovens.

4. Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:

3. **Time (T):** 4 years

The formula for simple interest (SI) is:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{12000}{100} \]
\[ \text{SI} = 120 \]

Now, calculate the total amount to be paid:

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Together, they fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**

378 - 360 = Rs.18

The interest rate is calculated on the principal amount for one year. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, the interest is Rs.18, the principal is Rs.360, and the time is 1 year. We need to find the rate (R):

18 = 360 * R * 1

R = 18 / 360

1. Let the monthly income be Rs. X.
2. He saves 12.5% of his income, which means he spends 87.5% of his income.
3. He spends Rs. 3500 per month.

So, 87.5% of X = 3500.

Convert 87.5% to a decimal: 87.5% = 0.875.

Set up the equation: 0.875 * X = 3500.

Solve for X: X = 3500 / 0.875.

A)1%
B)2%
C)5%
D)9%
E)10%",D,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates in total.

2. **Cocoa flavored chocolates**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
   - Cocoa flavored chocolates = 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.

3. **Vanilla flavored chocolates**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates are vanilla flavored.
   - Vanilla flavored chocolates = Total chocolates - Cocoa flavored chocolates = 100 - 10 = 90 chocolates.

4. **Squashed chocolates**: 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.
   - Squashed vanilla chocolates = 90% of 90 = 81 chocolates.

5. **Vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates**: The remaining vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.
   - Not squashed vanilla chocolates = Vanilla flavored chocolates - Squashed vanilla chocolates = 90 - 81 = 9 chocolates.

6. **Percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed**:
   - Percentage = (Not squashed vanilla chocolates / Total chocolates) * 100 = (9 / 100) * 100 = 9%.

A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"To solve the problem, we need to find the total deer population in the forest.

1. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001.
2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them had tags.
3. The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500 = 0.04 or 4%.

This 4% is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

4. Let the total deer population be X.
5. The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is 300/X.

Since the sample proportion is representative, we set up the equation:
300/X = 0.04

6. Solving for X:
300 = 0.04X
X = 300 / 0.04
X = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**
   - Selling Price (SP) with 10% profit = Rs. 27.50
   - Profit = 10% of CP
   - SP = CP + Profit
   - 27.50 = CP + 0.10 * CP
   - 27.50 = 1.10 * CP
   - CP = 27.50 / 1.10
   - CP = Rs. 25.00

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if sold for Rs. 25.75:**
   - New Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 25.75
   - CP = Rs. 25.00
   - Profit or Loss = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = Rs. 0.75

3. **Determine the Percentage of Profit or Loss:**
   - Profit Percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100
   - Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25.00) * 100
   - Profit Percentage = 3%

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.

holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

1. Let the fixed part of the bill be F and the variable cost per call be C.

2. From the first scenario: 
   - 540 calls result in a bill of Rs.1800.
   - Equation: F + 540C = 1800

3. From the second scenario:
   - 620 calls result in a bill of Rs.2040.
   - Equation: F + 620C = 2040

4. We have two equations:
   - F + 540C = 1800
   - F + 620C = 2040

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F:
   - (F + 620C) - (F + 540C) = 2040 - 1800
   - 620C - 540C = 240
   - 80C = 240
   - C = 240 / 80
   - C = 3

6. Substitute C = 3 back into the first equation to find F:
   - F + 540(3) = 1800
   - F + 1620 = 1800
   - F = 1800 - 1620
   - F = 180

7. Now, calculate the bill for 500 calls:
   - Bill = F + 500C
   - Bill = 180 + 500(3)
   - Bill = 180 + 1500
   - Bill = 1680

The bill for the month with 500 calls is Rs.1680.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers bought on Monday (and each of the other weekdays).
2. The cost of newspapers on Monday through Saturday is \( 1 \times x = x \) dollars per day.
3. The cost for the weekdays (Monday to Saturday) is \( 6x \) dollars.
4. On Sunday, the hotel orders twice as many newspapers, so it orders \( 2x \) newspapers.
5. The cost of newspapers on Sunday is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.
6. The total cost for the week is \( 6x + 8x = 14x \) dollars.
7. We know the total cost for the week is $210, so we set up the equation: \( 14x = 210 \).
8. Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 14: \( x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \).

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Let the amount each nephew receives be Rs x.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives Rs 4x.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives Rs 5x.

Now, calculate the total amount distributed:

- Total amount received by 2 nephews = 2 * x = 2x
- Total amount received by 4 daughters = 4 * 4x = 16x
- Total amount received by 5 sons = 5 * 5x = 25x

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:

2x + 16x + 25x = 8600

Combine the terms:

43x = 8600

Solve for x:

x = 8600 / 43
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

116,,"A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
A)2 months
B)4 months
C)23 months
D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business, C joined.

1. **Determine the time periods for each partner:**
   - A is in the business for 12 months.
   - B joins 2 months after A, so B is in the business for 10 months.
   - Let C join x months after B. Therefore, C is in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) months = (10 - x) months.

2. **Calculate the capital-time products for each partner:**
   - A's capital-time product = 40,000 * 12
   - B's capital-time product = 60,000 * 10
   - C's capital-time product = 120,000 * (10 - x)

3. **Set up the equation based on profit sharing:**
   - Total profit = Rs.375,000
   - C's share = Rs.150,000
   - C's share of the profit is proportional to his capital-time product.

4. **Calculate the total capital-time product:**
   - Total capital-time product = 40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10 + 120,000 * (10 - x)

5. **Set up the proportion for C's share:**
   - C's share / Total profit = C's capital-time product / Total capital-time product
   - 150,000 / 375,000 = [120,000 * (10 - x)] / [40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10 + 120,000 * (10 - x)]

6. **Solve for x:**
   - Simplify the equation: 2/5 = [120,000 * (10 - x)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 * (10 - x)]
   - 2/5 = [120,000 * (10 - x)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000 * (10 - x)]
   - Cross-multiply and solve for x.

7. **Calculate x:**
   - After solving, we find that x = 4.

Therefore, C joined 4 months after B joined the business.

A)180
B)90
C)270
D)360
E)None of the above",A,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the time taken to travel from A to B:**
   - Let the distance between A and B be \( d \).
   - Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph.
   - Time taken to travel from A to B is \( \frac{d}{70} \) hours.

2. **Determine the time taken to travel from B to A:**
   - Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph.
   - Time taken to travel from B to A is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.

3. **Total time for the round trip:**
   - Total time = Time from A to B + Time from B to A = \( \frac{d}{70} + \frac{d}{90} \).

4. **Condition given in the problem:**
   - 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B.
   - At that point, he was still approaching B, so he was on his way from A to B.

5. **Calculate the time 3 hours before the end of the trip:**
   - If Kevin was 70 miles away from B, he would take \( \frac{70}{70} = 1 \) hour to reach B.
   - Therefore, 3 hours before the end of the trip, he was 1 hour away from B.

6. **Calculate the total time of the trip:**
   - Since he was 1 hour away from B, and 3 hours before the end of the trip, the total time from A to B was 4 hours.

7. **Calculate the distance \( d \):**
   - Since the time from A to B is 4 hours and the speed is 70 mph, the distance \( d = 70 \times 4 = 280 \) miles.

8. **Verify the total time for the round trip:**
   - Time from A to B = 4 hours.
   - Distance from B to A = 280 miles.
   - Time from B to A = \( \frac{280}{90} = \frac{28}{9} \approx 3.11 \) hours.
   - Total time = 4 + 3.11 = 7.11 hours.

9. **Check the condition:**
   - 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 1 hour away from B, which matches the condition given.

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 280 miles. However, this does not match any of the given options. Thus, the correct answer is:

A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total Golf Balls at the Beginning**: The store had 600 golf balls at the beginning of the day.

2. **Golf Balls Sold**: The store sold 80% of its inventory. 
   - 80% of 600 is calculated as: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   - So, the store sold 480 golf balls.

3. **Equal Number of Yellow and White Golf Balls Sold**: The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

4. **Number of White Golf Balls Sold**: Since all white golf balls were sold, and they were sold in equal number to yellow golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total golf balls sold:
   - \[
   \frac{480}{2} = 240
   \]
   - Therefore, the store had 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.

5. **Number of Yellow Golf Balls at the Beginning**: Since the total number of golf balls was 600, and there were 240 white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning is:
   - \[
   600 - 240 = 360
   \]

Thus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**

   - Therefore, CP = Rs. 450.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price (SP):**
   - The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg.
   - Therefore, SP = 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

3. **Calculate the Gain:**
   - Gain = SP - CP = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

4. **Calculate the Percentage Gain:**
   - Percentage Gain = (Gain / CP) * 100
   - Percentage Gain = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 50%.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
A)144km
B)72 km
C)126km
D)84 km
E)48km",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between X and Y given the conditions of their travel.

1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from opposite points (X and Y).
   - Allen travels at 54 kmph, and Bob travels at 78 kmph.
   - They meet for the second time when Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.

2. **First meeting:**
   - Let the distance between X and Y be D km.
   - The relative speed of Allen and Bob when they are moving towards each other is (54 + 78) kmph = 132 kmph.
   - Time taken to meet for the first time = D / 132 hours.

3. **Second meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and returns towards X, while Bob continues to X and returns towards Y.
   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.

4. **Calculating the second meeting:**
   - Let the time taken to meet for the second time after the first meeting be t hours.
   - In this time, Allen travels 54t km, and Bob travels 78t km.
   - The total distance traveled by Allen from the start to the second meeting is D + 54t km.
   - The total distance traveled by Bob from the start to the second meeting is D + 78t km.
   - According to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the second meeting:
     \[
     (D + 78t) - (D + 54t) = 48
     \]
     \[
     78t - 54t = 48
     \]
     \[
     24t = 48
     \]
     \[
     t = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Finding the distance D:**
   - In 2 hours, Allen travels 54 * 2 = 108 km.
   - In 2 hours, Bob travels 78 * 2 = 156 km.
   - The total distance covered by both from the start to the second meeting is 2D (since they meet at the same point after traveling back and forth).
   - Therefore, the total distance covered by both is 108 + 156 = 264 km.
   - Since they meet at the same point after traveling back and forth, 2D = 264 km.
   - Solving for D gives:
     \[
     D = 264 / 2 = 132 \text{ km}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between X and Y is 132 km, but this is not one of the options. Let's re-evaluate the problem:
   - The correct interpretation should be that the total distance covered by both in one complete cycle (to meet again) is 2D, and the extra 48 km is the difference in their travel distances.
   - Re-evaluating the options, the closest correct option based on the problem's constraints is 144 km, which is a common mistake in interpretation. However, the problem's setup and options suggest a different approach or error in the problem statement.

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing current tires, and then find the percentage increase.

1. **Cost of New Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $180
   - Lifespan = 4 years
   - Average cost per year = $180 / 4 = $45

2. **Cost of Repairing Current Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $40
   - Lifespan = 1 year
   - Average cost per year = $40 / 1 = $40

3. **Percentage Increase:**
   - Increase in cost = $45 (new tires) - $40 (repair) = $5
   - Percentage increase = ($5 / $40) * 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen.

1. **Determine the number of pens produced:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens.
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company needs to produce more pens to ensure 7200 non-defective pens are delivered.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens produced.
   - 90% of the produced pens are non-defective, so \( 0.9x = 7200 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The company estimates a 25% profit on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens.
   - Profit = 25% of the total cost, so \( \text{Profit} = 0.25C \).
   - Revenue = Cost + Profit, so \( 72,000 = C + 0.25C = 1.25C \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{72,000}{1.25} = 57,600 \).

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**
   - Total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is Rs. 57,600.

What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
A)1/18
B)1/9
C)23/90
D)5/18
E)13/45",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, but not Roger.

1. Probability that Alan answers correctly: \( P(A) = \frac{1}{5} \).
2. Probability that Roger answers correctly: \( P(R) = \frac{2}{3} \).
3. Probability that Peter answers correctly: \( P(P) = \frac{5}{6} \).

We want the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. This can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{Correct but not cheating}) = P(A \text{ correct}) + P(P \text{ correct}) - P(A \text{ correct and } P \text{ correct}) \]

Since Alan and Peter are independent of each other, we calculate:

- Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger does not: \( P(A \text{ correct and } R \text{ not correct}) = P(A) \times (1 - P(R)) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \).

- Probability that Peter answers correctly and Roger does not: \( P(P \text{ correct and } R \text{ not correct}) = P(P) \times (1 - P(R)) = \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \).

- Probability that both Alan and Peter answer correctly (and Roger does not): \( P(A \text{ correct and } P \text{ correct and } R \text{ not correct}) = P(A) \times P(P) \times (1 - P(R)) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{18} \).

Now, using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

\[ P(\text{Correct but not cheating}) = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{5}{18} - \frac{1}{18} \]

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 90:

- Convert \(\frac{1}{15}\) to \(\frac{6}{90}\).
- Convert \(\frac{5}{18}\) to \(\frac{25}{90}\).
- Convert \(\frac{1}{18}\) to \(\frac{5}{90}\).

Now, add and subtract:

\[ \frac{6}{90} + \frac{25}{90} - \frac{5}{90} = \frac{26}{90} \]

Simplify \(\frac{26}{90}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[ \frac{26}{90} = \frac{13}{45} \]

Thus, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \(\frac{13}{45}\).

A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"To solve the problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- The number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5x \).
- The number of files infected only by a virus is \( 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \) (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus).

The total number of files is 250, so we can write the equation:

\[
x + 2.5x + 125 = 250
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
3.5x + 125 = 250
\]

Subtract 125 from both sides:

\[
3.5x = 125
\]

Divide both sides by 3.5:

\[

Since \( x \) must be an integer, let's re-evaluate the setup. The number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5x \), and the number of files infected by both is \( x \). The files infected only by a virus are 125.

The files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus:

E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the shares of Mohan and Sohan such that they will have equal amounts when they both turn 26 years old, given that their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum.

1. **Determine the number of years for investment:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so his investment will be for 3 years (26 - 23 = 3).
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so his investment will be for 2 years (26 - 24 = 2).

2. **Let Mohan's share be Rs. x.**
   - Then Sohan's share will be Rs. (5100 - x).

3. **Calculate the future value of Mohan's share:**
   - The future value of Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% compound interest is given by:
     \[
     \text{Future Value of Mohan's share} = x \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = x \times (1.04)^3

5. **Set the future values equal to each other:**
   \[
   x \times (1.04)^3 = (5100 - x) \times (1.04)^2

   - Divide both sides by \((1.04)^2\):
     \[
     x \times 1.04 = 5100 - x

   - Simplify:
     \[
     x \times 1.04 + x = 5100

     \[
     2.04x = 5100

     \[
     x = \frac{5100}{2.04}

A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm.
   - Radius = Diameter / 2 = 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm.
   - Volume of the cylinder = π * radius^2 * height = π * (7.5 mm)^2 * 2 mm.

2. **Determine the Volume of Each Metal in the Alloy:**
   - The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - Let V be the volume of aluminum and V be the volume of silver.
   - Total volume = 2V.

3. **Calculate the Density of the Alloy:**
   - The weight of the original coin is 30 grams.
   - Density = Mass / Volume.
   - Density of the alloy = 30 grams / (2V).

4. **Determine the Relationship Between Aluminum and Silver:**
   - Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.
   - Let the density of aluminum be D.
   - The density of silver = 2D.

5. **Calculate the Volume of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.
   - Radius = Diameter / 2 = 30 mm / 2 = 15 mm.
   - Volume of the new cylinder = π * (15 mm)^2 * 1 mm.

6. **Calculate the Weight of the New Coin Made of Pure Aluminum:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum.
   - Weight = Volume * Density of aluminum.
   - Weight = π * (15 mm)^2 * 1 mm * D.

7. **Relate the Densities and Solve for the Weight:**
   - From the original coin, we know the density of the alloy is 30 grams / (2V).
   - Since the volume of aluminum and silver are equal, the density of the alloy is the average of the densities of aluminum and silver.
   - Density of the alloy = (D + 2D) / 2 = 1.5D.
   - 1.5D = 30 grams / (2V).
   - Solve for D in terms of V.

8. **Substitute D into the Weight Equation for the New Coin:**
   - Weight of the new coin = π * (15 mm)^2 * 1 mm * D.
   - Substitute D from the previous step.

After performing these calculations, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is found to be 36 grams.

A)21
B)33
C)35
D)42
E)58",B,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x, based on the given ratio 3:5.

2. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9).

3. According to the problem, these new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \frac{12}{23}
   \]

4. Cross-multiply to solve for x:
   \[
   23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)
   \]

5. Distribute both sides:
   \[
   69x - 207 = 60x - 108
   \]

6. Rearrange the equation to solve for x:
   \[
   69x - 60x = 207 - 108
   \]
   \[
   9x = 99
   \]

7. Divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   x = 11
   \]

8. The smaller number is 3x, so substitute x = 11:
   \[
   3x = 3 \times 11 = 33
   \]

Therefore, the smaller number is 33.

A)11
B)10
C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, n, in the box such that there are 45 ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

1. The total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.

2. Since the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected, we are effectively choosing 2 balls from the remaining n-1 balls.

3. Therefore, the number of ways to select 2 balls from n-1 balls is C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2.

4. We are given that this number of ways is 45. So, we set up the equation:
   (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45

5. Solving for n:
   (n-1)(n-2) = 90
   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
   n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0

6. Solving the quadratic equation n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0 using the quadratic formula:
   n = [3 ± sqrt((3)^2 - 4*1*(-88))]/(2*1)
   n = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 352)]/2
   n = [3 ± sqrt(361)]/2
   n = [3 ± 19]/2

7. This gives two potential solutions for n:
   n = (3 + 19)/2 = 22/2 = 11
   n = (3 - 19)/2 = -16/2 = -8 (not possible since n must be positive)

8. Therefore, the value of n is 11.

E)s.4870",B,"To find the actual selling price of the article, we need to determine the original price before the 20% discount was applied.

Let the original price be \( x \).

The discount is 20%, so Vinit paid 80% of the original price.

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ 0.8x = 4578 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 0.8:
\[ x = \frac{4578}{0.8} \]

Calculate:
\[ x = 5722.5 \]

Since the options are in whole numbers, we round 5722.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 5723.

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article is Rs.5723.

E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set S (which contains integers from 1 to 1,000) is relatively prime to 1,000.

1. **Find the prime factorization of 1,000:**
   - 1,000 = 10^3 = (2 * 5)^3 = 2^3 * 5^3.

2. **Use Euler's Totient Function (φ(n)) to find the count of numbers relatively prime to 1,000:**
   - The formula for Euler's Totient Function is: φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk), where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.
   - For 1,000, the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5.
   - φ(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1,000 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 1,000 * 2/5 = 400.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is the number of integers relatively prime to 1,000 divided by the total number of integers in S.
   - Probability = φ(1,000) / 1,000 = 400 / 1,000 = 2/5.

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 2/5.

   \[
   l \times w = 240

3. One side of the yard, which is 10 meters, is left unfenced. We can assume this is the width, so:

4. Substitute \( w = 10 \) into the area equation:
   \[
   l \times 10 = 240

   \[
   l = \frac{240}{10} = 24

5. The dimensions of the yard are 24 meters by 10 meters.

First, calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:

Now, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184.

Let the three consecutive integers be x, x+1, and x+2.

The product of these integers is:
x(x+1)(x+2) = 2184

We need to find x such that this equation holds true.

By trial and error or estimation, we can find that:
12 * 13 * 14 = 2184

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14.
