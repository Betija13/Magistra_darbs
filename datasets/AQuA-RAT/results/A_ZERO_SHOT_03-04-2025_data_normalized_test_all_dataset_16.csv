The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

Imagine the car is moving towards a giant tree (the tower) and you're watching the top of this tree from the car. The angle at which you see the top of the tree changes as you get closer. Initially, you see it at a 45° angle, and then, after 10 minutes, you see it at a 60° angle. We need to figure out how much longer it will take for you to reach the base of the tree.

Let's use some Earthly math magic called trigonometry to solve this. When the angle of elevation is 45°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is equal to the height of the tower (because tan(45°) = 1). Let's call the height of the tower \( h \).

When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \( \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \) (because tan(60°) = √3, and the distance is height divided by tan(60°)).

The car travels this distance in 10 minutes. So, the speed of the car is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{10} = \frac{h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more time it will take to reach the base of the tower from the point where the angle is 60°. The remaining distance to the base is \( \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Using the speed we calculated, the time \( t \) to cover this remaining distance is:

\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10}}
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \times 10}{h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}
\]

The \( h \) cancels out:

\[
t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\[
t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2 = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

So:

\[
t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
\]

Therefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

The answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).",True,,,,,
1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The item has an original price, let's call it \( P \).
   - The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( 0.78P \) (since 100% - 22% = 78% or 0.78 as a decimal).
   - The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is \( 0.78P - 20 \).
   - The customer ends up paying $1.90 more than half the original price, which is \( \frac{P}{2} + 1.90 \).

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The equation based on the above information is:
     \[
     0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - First, let's get all the terms involving \( P \) on one side:
     \[
     0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 1.90 + 20
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 21.90
     \]
   - Convert \( 0.78P \) and \( \frac{P}{2} \) to have a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{78P}{100} - \frac{50P}{100} = 21.90
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     \frac{28P}{100} = 21.90
     \]
   - Solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides by 100/28:
     \[
     P = \frac{21.90 \times 100}{28}
     \]
   - Calculate the value:
     \[
     P = \frac{2190}{28} = 78.2142857

We're looking for a number that is a multiple of some mysterious number \( X \), and this number must also be divisible by both 9 and 12. To find such a number, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12, because any number that is divisible by both 9 and 12 must be a multiple of their LCM.

Let's break it down:

1. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
2. **Divisibility by 12**: A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.

To find the LCM of 9 and 12, we first find their prime factorizations:
- 9 = \( 3^2 \)
- 12 = \( 2^2 \times 3 \)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- For 2, the highest power is \( 2^2 \).
- For 3, the highest power is \( 3^2 \).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36 \).

Now, we need to check which of the given choices is a multiple of 36. Let's examine the options:

- **A) 36**: This is exactly 36, which is a multiple of itself.

B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

We have two stocks, A and B. The probability that Stock A will increase is 0.56, and for Stock B, it's 0.74. We want to find the greatest probability that neither stock increases.

First, let's think about the probability that each stock does not increase. For Stock A, this is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\). For Stock B, it's \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

Now, if we want to find the probability that neither stock increases, we need to consider the scenario where both stocks do not increase. This is where the concept of independence comes in. If the events were independent, the probability that neither increases would be the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = P(\text{A does not increase}) \times P(\text{B does not increase}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies that we should consider the worst-case scenario where the events are not independent and are instead mutually exclusive. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is maximized when the events are as dependent as possible.

The greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the probability of at least one event occurring is minimized. The probability that at least one event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{A or B increases}) = P(A \text{ increases}) + P(B \text{ increases}) - P(A \text{ and } B \text{ increase}). \]

To maximize the probability that neither event occurs, we minimize \( P(A \text{ and } B \text{ increase}) \). The minimum value for this is 0, which occurs when the events are mutually exclusive.

Thus, the greatest probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - P(\text{A or B increases}) = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0) = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

However, probabilities cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our assumption. Let's correct this by considering the maximum overlap:

The maximum probability that neither event occurs is when the events are completely independent, which we calculated as 0.1144. But this doesn't match any of the choices, so let's re-evaluate:

The correct approach is to consider the overlap in the worst-case scenario where the events are not independent. The maximum probability that neither event occurs is when the events are as dependent as possible, which means:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is:

The trader sold an article for Rs.360, making a profit of 20%. This means the selling price (SP) is 120% of the cost price (CP) because the cost price plus 20% of the cost price equals the selling price.

Let's break it down:

1. **Understand the relationship**: 
   - Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + 20% of CP
   - SP = 120% of CP

2. **Translate the percentage into a mathematical equation**:
   - 120% of CP = 1.20 * CP

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a bag full of white marbles. We don't know how many marbles are in the bag initially, so let's call this number \( Q \).

2. **First Action**: We pull out 20 marbles and paint them black. These 20 marbles are then returned to the bag. So now, the bag contains \( Q \) marbles, 20 of which are black.

3. **Second Action**: We pull out another 20 marbles. Among these, 1 marble is black. This means that the proportion of black marbles in this sample is \( \frac{1}{20} \).

4. **Percentage Representation**: The problem states that this proportion (or percentage) of black marbles in the sample represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag. Therefore, the proportion of black marbles in the bag is also \( \frac{1}{20} \).

We're tasked with creating a bike number that consists of two letters followed by two numbers. The question is how many distinct combinations we can form, and it also asks how many of these letters need to be distinct.

1. **Letters Part**: 
   - The English alphabet has 26 letters. 
   - For the first letter, you have 26 choices.
   - For the second letter, you also have 26 choices because the problem doesn't specify that the letters need to be distinct.

2. **Numbers Part**:
   - Numbers range from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible choices for each digit.
   - For the first number, you have 10 choices.
   - For the second number, you also have 10 choices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of combinations:

- Total combinations for letters = 26 (first letter) * 26 (second letter) = 676
- Total combinations for numbers = 10 (first number) * 10 (second number) = 100

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, multiply the combinations of letters by the combinations of numbers:

   - For the second letter, you have 25 choices (since it must be different from the first).

- Total combinations for distinct letters = 26 * 25 = 650

1. **Initial Journey Details**: The train is initially traveling at 100 miles per hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. This means the total distance is:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}

   This means at least 70 students participated in the debating session.

3. **Maximum Overlap**: To find the maximum number of students who did neither, we need to consider the maximum overlap between the two groups. The more overlap there is, the fewer students are left out of both activities.

   - If 90 students attended the prom and 70 students participated in the debate, the total number of students involved in at least one activity is minimized when the overlap is maximized.
   - The maximum overlap occurs when all 70 students who participated in the debate also attended the prom. In this case, the number of students involved in at least one activity is:

The production cost per component is $110. Therefore, the total production cost for the year is:

\[ 5040 \text{ units} \times 110 \text{ dollars/unit} = 554,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as the difference between revenue and production costs. So, the revenue must be:

\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Profit} + \text{Production Cost} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,080,800 \text{ dollars} \]

This is the total revenue needed for the year. To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue by the total number of components:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Component} = \frac{1,080,800 \text{ dollars}}{5040 \text{ units}} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Component} = 214.2857 \text{ dollars/unit} \]

Since we need the minimum selling price that is a whole number and ensures the profit is at least $626,400, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $215.

Imagine a factory that makes staplers. On a particular Monday, some of these staplers were not up to the mark, or ""defective,"" as we call them. Specifically, 10% of all the staplers made that day were defective. Now, from the remaining staplers that were not defective, a small mistake happened: 2% of these good staplers were accidentally rejected.

We know that 72 of these good staplers were wrongly rejected. Our task is to find out how many staplers were made in total that day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced.**

2. **Calculate the number of defective staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers are defective, so the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate the number of non-defective staplers:**
   - If 10% are defective, then 90% are non-defective.
   - So, the number of non-defective staplers is \( 0.90x \).

4. **Calculate the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
   - Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers rejected is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

5. **We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected:**
   - So, \( 0.018x = 72 \).

We have the word ""PROBLEC,"" which consists of 7 unique letters. Our task is to rearrange these letters to form new 7-letter words, ensuring that no letter is repeated in any word. 

Since all the letters are unique and we are using all of them to form each word, the number of ways to rearrange these letters is simply the number of permutations of 7 distinct items. 

In the language of mathematics, the number of permutations of 7 distinct letters is given by 7 factorial, denoted as \(7!\).

Calculating \(7!\):
\[ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \]

Thus, there are 5040 different ways to rearrange the letters of ""PROBLEC"" to form 7-letter words with no repeating letters.

We have two events, A and B, and we're told they are independent. This means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. It's like having two separate nut piles that don't influence each other.

The probability of event A happening is 0.2, and the probability of event B happening is 0.8. Now, we're asked to find the probability of A given B, denoted as P(A/B).

E)None of the above",A,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this mystery together. Imagine you're on a staircase elevator, which is like a moving staircase that helps you get to the bottom. You can walk on it, or you can just stand and let it carry you down.

Here's the situation: 

1. **Scenario 1**: You walk 20 steps and then stop. It takes you 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
2. **Scenario 2**: You walk 10 steps and then stop. It takes you 20 minutes to reach the bottom.

We need to find out how fast the elevator is moving, in steps per minute.

Let's break it down:

- **Let \( v \) be the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.**
- **Let \( d \) be the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.**

**Scenario 1:**
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( d - 20 \) steps.
- It takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
- The elevator covers \( d - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes, so its speed equation is:
  \[
  v \times 10 = d - 20
  \]
  \[
  d = 10v + 20
  \]

**Scenario 2:**
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( d - 10 \) steps.
- It takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom.
- The elevator covers \( d - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes, so its speed equation is:
  \[
  v \times 20 = d - 10
  \]
  \[
  d = 20v + 10
  \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( d = 10v + 20 \)
2. \( d = 20v + 10 \)

Set them equal to each other because they both equal \( d \):
\[
10v + 20 = 20v + 10
\]

Solve for \( v \):
\[
10v + 20 = 20v + 10
\]
\[
20 = 10v + 10
\]
\[
10 = 10v
\]
\[
v = 1
\]

So, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

A)21
B)30
C)31
D)32
E)None of the above",D,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

First, let's figure out how many microwave ovens were sold last year. The store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month for 12 months. So, the total number sold last year is:

\[ 42 \text{ microwaves/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ microwaves} \]

Now, let's look at the first 10 months of this year. The store sold an average of 20 microwaves per month. So, the total number sold in these 10 months is:

\[ 20 \text{ microwaves/month} \times 10 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ microwaves} \]

To find the average number of microwaves sold per month over the entire 22-month period, we need to add up all the microwaves sold and then divide by the total number of months:

Total microwaves sold over 22 months = 504 (last year) + 200 (this year) = 704 microwaves

Total months = 12 (last year) + 10 (this year) = 22 months

Average per month over 22 months = \(\frac{704 \text{ microwaves}}{22 \text{ months}}\)

Now, let's do the division:

We have a class with z students, and we're interested in the average score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scores. Let's call the highest score \( H \) and the lowest score \( L \).

1. **Given Information:**
   - The average of the highest and lowest scores is \( x \). This means:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6
\]

First, let's decode the denominator:

\[
13 \times 13 = 169
\]

Subtract 156 from 169:

\[
169 - 156 = 13
\]

So, the denominator is 13. Now, let's focus on the numerator:

\[
5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7

Simplify the constants first:

\[
5 - 15 - 7 = -17
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
? \times 19 - 17
\]

Now, we know the whole fraction equals 6:

\[
\frac{? \times 19 - 17}{13} = 6
\]

To find the value of the numerator, multiply both sides by 13:

\[
? \times 19 - 17 = 6 \times 13
\]

Calculate \(6 \times 13\):

\[
6 \times 13 = 78
\]

So, we have:

\[
? \times 19 - 17 = 78
\]

Add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the mystery variable:

\[
? \times 19 = 78 + 17
\]

Calculate \(78 + 17\):

\[
78 + 17 = 95

Now, solve for the mystery variable by dividing both sides by 19:

\[
? = \frac{95}{19}

Calculate \(\frac{95}{19}\):

\[
\frac{95}{19} = 5

21,,"Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

We have two toy makers: Alex and Jacob. Alex is a bit faster, taking 7 hours to make one toy, while Jacob takes 9 hours. Together, they made 35 toys in a month, and they worked for almost the same number of hours.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys Alex made.
- \( J \) as the number of toys Jacob made.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since they made 35 toys together).

Now, let's consider the hours they worked:
- Alex worked \( 7A \) hours (since he takes 7 hours per toy).
- Jacob worked \( 9J \) hours (since he takes 9 hours per toy).

The problem states they worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations to find out how many toys Jacob made.

First, from \( A + J = 35 \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the hours equation:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Expanding this gives:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ J \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number (you can't make a fraction of a toy), and considering the options given, the closest whole number is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is \( \boxed{15} \).",False,,,,,
22,,"John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.

John starts with a tea that is 50% strong. This means that in the beginning, half of the tea is the strong tea component, and the other half is milk.

1. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the tea with milk. 
   - Initially, the tea is 50% strong, so in 100 parts of tea, 50 parts are strong tea.
   - He replaces 15% of the entire tea, which is 15 parts, with milk.
   - The amount of strong tea left after this replacement is \( 50 - (0.15 \times 50) = 50 - 7.5 = 42.5 \) parts.
   - The total solution is still 100 parts, but now with more milk.

2. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, he replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - The new solution still has 100 parts, with 42.5 parts being strong tea.
   - He replaces 15% of 100 parts, which is 15 parts, with milk.
   - The amount of strong tea left after this replacement is \( 42.5 - (0.15 \times 42.5) = 42.5 - 6.375 = 36.125 \) parts.

3. **Third Replacement:**
   - Now, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
   - The solution still has 100 parts, with 36.125 parts being strong tea.
   - He replaces 10% of 100 parts, which is 10 parts, with milk.
   - The amount of strong tea left after this replacement is \( 36.125 - (0.10 \times 36.125) = 36.125 - 3.6125 = 32.5125 \) parts.

Finally, the concentration of strong tea in the final solution is \( \frac{32.5125}{100} \times 100\% = 32.5125\% \).

So, the final concentration of tea John drinks is approximately 32.51%.

1. **Bill's Usual Speed**: On a normal day, Bill rides his bicycle at 15 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Windy Day Speed**: The wind slows him down by 4 mph. So, on a windy day, his speed is:
   \[
   15 \text{ mph} - 4 \text{ mph} = 11 \text{ mph}

The retailer sold an appliance for 40% above its cost, and this increase in price gave them a gross profit of $20.00. We need to find out the selling price of the appliance.

Let's break it down:

1. **Understanding the Profit**: The gross profit of $20.00 is the extra amount the retailer made by selling the appliance at 40% above its cost.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of the appliance.
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost, which means the selling price is \( C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).

3. **Relating Profit to Cost**:
   - The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is \( 1.4C - C = 0.4C \).
   - We know this profit is $20.00, so \( 0.4C = 20 \).

4. **Solving for Cost**:
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
     \]

5. **Finding the Selling Price**:
   - The selling price is 1.4 times the cost:

A)750
B)700
C)620
D)600
E)None of these",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at a 6% simple interest rate per year. Simple interest means that the interest is calculated only on the original amount (the principal) each year, not on any interest that has been added.

Here's how we calculate the simple interest:

1. **Principal (P)**: Rs. 500
2. **Rate of Interest (R)**: 6% per annum
3. **Time (T)**: 4 years

The formula for simple interest (SI) is:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]

\[ \text{SI} = \frac{12000}{100} \]

\[ \text{SI} = 120 \]

So, the interest over 4 years is Rs. 120.

Now, to find the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we add the interest to the principal:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 500 + 120 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 620 \]

Therefore, the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is Rs. 620.

E)128km",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

The jeep travels a certain distance, let's call it \( D \), in 6 hours on its forward journey. So, the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is \( \frac{D}{6} \) km/hr.

On the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours to cover the same distance \( D \). So, the speed on the return journey is \( \frac{D}{4} \) km/hr.

Now, according to the problem, the return speed is 12 km/hr faster than the forward speed. So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{6} + 12
\]

To solve this equation, let's first eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator, which is 12. Multiply every term by 12:

\[
12 \times \frac{D}{4} = 12 \times \left(\frac{D}{6} + 12\right)

1. **Wholesale Cost**: Let's call this \( W \). This is the base price, the cost to the store before they add their markup.

2. **Original Retail Price**: This is 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if the wholesale cost is \( W \), the original retail price is:
   \[
   W + 0.6W = 1.6W

A)1584

D)1320
E)1200",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this mystery together!

Imagine you have a magical rectangular sheet of paper. When you fold it in half along one direction, you get two smaller rectangles, each with a perimeter of 48 cm. When you fold it along the other direction, you get two smaller rectangles, each with a perimeter of 66 cm.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangle as \( L \) (length) and \( W \) (width).

1. **Folding along the length:**
   - When you fold along the length, each half has a width of \( W \) and a new length of \( \frac{L}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is \( 2 \times \left(\frac{L}{2} + W\right) = 48 \).
   - Simplifying, we get: \( L + 2W = 48 \).

2. **Folding along the width:**
   - When you fold along the width, each half has a length of \( L \) and a new width of \( \frac{W}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is \( 2 \times \left(L + \frac{W}{2}\right) = 66 \).
   - Simplifying, we get: \( 2L + W = 66 \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( L + 2W = 48 \)
2. \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Let's solve these equations to find \( L \) and \( W \).

From the first equation, express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ L = 48 - 2W \]

Substitute this expression for \( L \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4W + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3W = 66 \]
\[ 30 = 3W \]
\[ W = 10 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 10 \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = 48 - 2(10) \]
\[ L = 48 - 20 \]
\[ L = 28 \]

Now that we have \( L = 28 \) and \( W = 10 \), we can find the area of the original sheet:

Imagine you have a journey from place M to place Q, and along the way, you have to make stops at N, O, and P. At each stop, you have a certain number of bus options to choose from:

1. From M to N, you have 3 different buses.
2. From N to O, you have 4 different buses.
3. From O to P, you have 1 bus (so no choice here, just one way).
4. From P to Q, you have 3 different buses.

To find out how many different ways you can travel from M to Q, you need to multiply the number of choices you have at each leg of the journey. This is because for each choice you make at one leg, you have all the choices available at the next leg.

This box is nestled perfectly inside a sphere, with all its corners touching the sphere's surface. Our mission is to find the diameter of this sphere.

To solve this, we need to find the diagonal of the rectangular solid, because this diagonal will be the same as the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

In our case, the dimensions are \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 15\). Plug these values into the formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} \]

Calculate each square:

- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(15^2 = 225\)

Add these up:

\[ 9 + 16 + 225 = 250 \]

Now, take the square root of 250 to find the diagonal:

\[ d = \sqrt{250} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ d = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10} \]

Now, let's approximate \(5\sqrt{10}\). We know that \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.162\), so:

\[ 5 \times 3.162 \approx 15.81 \]

Thus, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.81. Looking at the choices, the closest match is:

\[ \boxed{B) 15.8113} \]

So, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.8113, which corresponds to choice (B).",True,,,,,

1. **Starting Point (Home):** Let's call this point (0, 0) in our cosmic coordinate system.

2. **First Move (South 3 km):** Moving south means going downwards in our cosmic grid. So, we move from (0, 0) to (0, -3).

3. **Second Move (East 5 km):** Now, moving east means going to the right. So, we move from (0, -3) to (5, -3).

The shopkeeper is selling a watch and gives a discount on the marked price. When he gives a 5% discount, he earns a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount, his profit decreases by Rs. 15. We need to find out the marked price of the watch.

Let's break it down:

1. **Marked Price (MP):** This is the original price tag on the watch before any discounts.

2. **Discounts:**
   - A 5% discount means the shopkeeper sells the watch at 95% of the marked price.
   - A 7% discount means he sells it at 93% of the marked price.

3. **Profit Difference:** The difference in profit between the 5% discount and the 7% discount is Rs. 15.

Now, let's set up the equations:

- Selling price with a 5% discount: \( SP_1 = 0.95 \times MP \)
- Selling price with a 7% discount: \( SP_2 = 0.93 \times MP \)

The difference in selling prices (which is the difference in profit) is Rs. 15:

\[ SP_1 - SP_2 = 15 \]

Substitute the expressions for \( SP_1 \) and \( SP_2 \):

\[ 0.95 \times MP - 0.93 \times MP = 15 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ (0.95 - 0.93) \times MP = 15 \]

\[ 0.02 \times MP = 15 \]

Now, solve for \( MP \):

\[ MP = \frac{15}{0.02} \]

\[ MP = 750 \]

The student was supposed to find \(\frac{7}{8}\) of a number, let's call this number \(x\). Instead, the student found \(\frac{7}{18}\) of the same number. The difference between these two calculations is given as 770.

Let's set up the equations:

1. The correct calculation: \(\frac{7}{8} \times x\)
2. The incorrect calculation: \(\frac{7}{18} \times x\)

The difference between these two results is 770:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
\]

To solve this, we first need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{7}{8}\) and \(\frac{7}{18}\). The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

Convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{72} = \frac{63}{72}
\]

\[
\frac{7}{18} = \frac{7 \times 4}{72} = \frac{28}{72}

Now, substitute these into the equation:

\[
\frac{63}{72}x - \frac{28}{72}x = 770

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{63x - 28x}{72} = 770

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{35x}{72} = 770

The shop assistant's monthly salary \( S \) is made up of two parts:
1. A fixed salary of $500.
2. An additional 5% of her monthly sales.

We want her total salary to be $1500. So, we set up the equation like this:

\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want \( S \) to be $1500, so we plug that into the equation:

Now, let's solve for the sales:

1. Subtract the fixed salary from both sides to isolate the sales component:

   \[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

   \[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

2. To find the sales, divide both sides by 0.05:

   \[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

The aeroplane is flying around a square, which means it travels the same distance on each of the four sides. Let's call the length of each side of the square \(d\).

The plane flies at different speeds on each side:
- First side: 200 km/hr
- Second side: 400 km/hr
- Third side: 600 km/hr
- Fourth side: 800 km/hr

To find the average speed, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance is \(4d\).

2. **Total Time**: We calculate the time taken for each side and sum them up.
   - Time for the first side: \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
   - Time for the second side: \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours
   - Time for the third side: \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours
   - Time for the fourth side: \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours

   Total time \(T\) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}

   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 2400:

Jack has bought a total of 18 sharpeners, which are either white or brown. He spent a total of 100 rupees on these sharpeners. The key detail here is that each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener.

Let's use some interdimensional math to solve this:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of sharpeners is 18: 
     \[
     x + y = 18
     \]
   - Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.
   - The total cost is 100 rupees:
     \[
     x(b + 1) + yb = 100
     \]

3. **Simplify the Cost Equation:**
   - Expand the cost equation:
     \[
     xb + x + yb = 100
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (x + y)b + x = 100
     \]
   - Since \( x + y = 18 \), substitute:
     \[
     18b + x = 100
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 - 18b
     \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into \( x + y = 18 \):
     \[
     (100 - 18b) + y = 18
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 18 - (100 - 18b)
     \]
     \[
     y = 18b - 82
     \]

5. **Check Integer Solutions:**
   - Both \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers.
   - From \( x = 100 - 18b \), \( x \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     100 - 18b \geq 0 \Rightarrow b \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56
     \]
   - From \( y = 18b - 82 \), \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     18b - 82 \geq 0 \Rightarrow b \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56
     \]

6. **Test Integer Values for \( b \):**
   - Possible integer values for \( b \) are 5.
   - If \( b = 5 \):
     - \( x = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 10 \)

C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast can understand.

First, we know that hose A can fill the pool all by itself in 8 hours. This means that in 1 hour, hose A fills \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the pool.

Now, hose A works alone for the first 2 hours. In those 2 hours, it fills:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool.} \]

This means that after 2 hours, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pool is filled, and \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool is still empty.

Next, hoses A and B work together to fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours. Let's denote the rate at which hose B fills the pool as \(\frac{1}{b}\) of the pool per hour.

Together, hoses A and B fill the pool at a rate of:
\[ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} \text{ of the pool per hour.} \]

In 3 hours, they fill \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool, so:
\[ 3 \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} \right) = \frac{3}{4}. \]

Divide both sides by 3 to find the rate:
\[ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

Now, solve for \(\frac{1}{b}\):
\[ \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8}. \]

Find a common denominator to subtract:
\[ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8}, \]
\[ \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}. \]

This means hose B also fills \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the pool per hour, just like hose A. Therefore, hose B would take 8 hours to fill the pool by itself.

We have a 5-digit number, which we'll call \( N \). The problem states that if we place a 1 after this number, it becomes three times as large as if we place a 1 before it.

Let's break this down:

1. **Placing a 1 after the number \( N \):**
   - This transforms \( N \) into \( 10N + 1 \).

2. **Placing a 1 before the number \( N \):**
   - This transforms \( N \) into \( 100000 + N \).

According to the problem, the first transformation (placing a 1 after) is three times the second transformation (placing a 1 before). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ 10N + 1 = 3(100000 + N) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ 10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N \]

Subtract \( 3N \) from both sides:

We have a city with a current population of 78,000. This population is growing at a rate of 5% per year. We need to figure out what the population will be in 2 years.

Here's how we do it:

1. **First Year Calculation:**
   - Start with the current population: 78,000.
   - Increase it by 5%: 
     - 5% of 78,000 is \( 0.05 \times 78,000 = 3,900 \).
   - Add this increase to the original population: 
     - \( 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900 \).

2. **Second Year Calculation:**
   - Now, take the new population of 81,900.
   - Increase it again by 5%:
     - 5% of 81,900 is \( 0.05 \times 81,900 = 4,095 \).
   - Add this increase to the population after the first year:
     - \( 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995 \).

So, after 2 years, the population will be 85,995.

Here's the plan: 

1. **Combine their speeds**: Since they're moving towards each other, we add their speeds together to find out how fast the distance between them is closing. So, 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph.

2. **Calculate the time to meet**: The total distance they need to cover together is 50 miles. Since they're closing the gap at a combined speed of 25 mph, we can use the formula:

   \[

The servant wants to earn a total of 6000 Rupees in a month. He gets a fixed salary of 1500 Rupees, and the rest of his income comes from a 15% commission on the sales he makes.

So, let's calculate how much he needs to earn from commissions alone:

1. **Total desired income**: 6000 Rupees
2. **Fixed salary**: 1500 Rupees

To find out how much he needs from commissions, we subtract his fixed salary from his total desired income:

\[ \text{Commission needed} = 6000 - 1500 = 4500 \text{ Rupees} \]

Now, the commission is 15% of the sales. Let's denote the sales he needs to make as \( S \).

The commission he earns from sales is 15% of \( S \), which can be expressed as:

\[ 0.15 \times S = 4500 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:

\[ S = \frac{4500}{0.15} \]

Calculating that gives us:

\[ S = 30000 \]

So, the servant needs to make sales worth 30000 Rupees to achieve his desired monthly income of 6000 Rupees.

E)12%",D,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. First, let's calculate the total amount he pays back:

\[ \text{Total repayment} = 12 \times 31.50 = 378 \text{ Rs} \]

Now, the interest he pays is the difference between what he borrowed and what he repaid:

\[ \text{Interest paid} = 378 - 360 = 18 \text{ Rs} \]

Next, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to consider the interest paid over the year. Since he pays Rs.18 in interest over the year on a principal of Rs.360, the annual interest rate can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Interest paid}}{\text{Principal}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Interest rate} = \left( \frac{18}{360} \right) \times 100\% = 5\% \]

Imagine you have a product that originally costs 100 shiny acorns. Now, if the price is reduced by 30%, it means you lose 30% of those acorns. So, you have:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

This means the new price is 70 acorns.

Now, the question is: by what percentage should we increase 70 acorns to get back to the original 100 acorns?

Let's call the percentage increase \( x\% \). When you increase 70 acorns by \( x\% \), you get:

\[ 70 + \frac{x}{100} \times 70 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \), we have:

\[ 70 + 0.7x = 100 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[ 0.7x = 30 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{30}{0.7} \]

\[ x = 42.8571\ldots \]

You have a pouch with Rs. 700, and inside, there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins. Let's call the number of each type of coin ""x"".

Now, let's convert everything into paise because it's easier to count when everything is in the same unit. Remember, 1 rupee = 100 paise.

- Each 25 paise coin is worth 25 paise.
- Each 50 paise coin is worth 50 paise.
- Each 1 rupee coin is worth 100 paise.

So, the total value of the coins can be expressed as:

The man spends Rs. 3500 each month, and this is not his entire income. He also saves 12.5% of his income. We need to find out what his total income is.

Let's call his total monthly income ""I"". According to the problem, he spends Rs. 3500 and saves 12.5% of his income. This means:

1. The amount he saves is 12.5% of his income, which is \( \frac{12.5}{100} \times I = \frac{1}{8} \times I \).

2. The rest of his income, which he spends, is \( I - \frac{1}{8} \times I = \frac{7}{8} \times I \).

We know he spends Rs. 3500, so we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{7}{8} \times I = 3500
\]

To find ""I"", we solve for it by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{7}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{7} \):

\[
I = 3500 \times \frac{8}{7}
\]

Calculating that gives:

We have three painters: Mr. Brown, Mr. Black, and Mr. Blue. Each has their own speed of painting a house:

- Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days.
- Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days.
- Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days.

The company needs to paint 3 houses in total.

**Step 1: Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days.**

Mr. Brown paints 1 house in 6 days, so in 1 day, he paints \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house. In 8 days, he paints:

\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ houses} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days.**

Mr. Black paints 1 house in 8 days, so in 1 day, he paints \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house. In 6 days, he paints:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total work done so far.**

Adding the work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:

\[ \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \]

So, the total work done is:

\[ \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \text{ houses} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining work.**

The total work needed is 3 houses. The remaining work is:

\[ 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \text{ houses} \]

**Step 5: Calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to finish the remaining work.**

Mr. Blue paints 1 house in 12 days, so in 1 day, he paints \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house. To paint \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take him:

We have a hollow cube with an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm. This means the cube is made up of smaller cubes, each 1 cm on a side.

1. **Outer Cube Dimensions**: The outer cube is 5 cm on each side. So, if you imagine it as a big block, it would be made up of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.

2. **Inner Hollow Cube**: Because the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, there's an inner cube that isn't part of the outer shell. The inner cube has dimensions of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm on each side (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side, you subtract 2 cm in total).

3. **Inner Cube Volume**: The inner cube, which is not part of the outer shell, is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

4. **Cubes in the Shell**: The cubes that make up the shell are the total cubes minus the inner hollow part. So, \(125 - 27 = 98\) cubes are in the shell.

5. **Painted Faces**: All the cubes in the shell have at least one face painted because they form the outer surface of the cube.

6. **Unpainted Faces**: The question asks for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. Each cube in the shell has 6 faces, but only the outer faces are painted. The inner faces that are not exposed to the outside remain unpainted.

   - Each cube in the shell has 1 to 3 faces painted, depending on its position (corner, edge, or face center). However, the key is to find the total number of unpainted faces.

7. **Total Faces of All Cubes**: There are 125 cubes in total, each with 6 faces, so there are \(125 \times 6 = 750\) faces in total.

8. **Painted Faces**: The outer surface of the cube is painted. The outer surface area of the cube is \(5 \times 5 \times 6 = 150\) faces (since each face of the cube is \(5 \times 5\) and there are 6 faces).

9. **Unpainted Faces Calculation**: The unpainted faces are the total faces minus the painted faces. So, \(750 - 150 = 600\) faces remain unpainted.

However, this seems off because the choices don't match. Let's re-evaluate:

- The inner 3x3x3 cube (27 cubes) has all its faces unpainted. Each of these 27 cubes has 6 faces, so \(27 \times 6 = 162\) faces are unpainted from the inner cube.

- The remaining 98 cubes in the shell have some unpainted faces. Each of these cubes has at least 1 face painted, but not all faces are painted.

- The total unpainted faces should be calculated by considering the inner faces of the shell cubes that are not exposed.

First, imagine you have a big pile of chocolates. Out of all these chocolates, 10% are cocoa flavored. This means that 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored because all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa.

Now, let's focus on the vanilla chocolates. We know that 90% of the remaining chocolates (which are vanilla) are squashed. So, let's break it down:

1. **Total Chocolates**: 100% (since we're dealing with percentages, let's assume there are 100 chocolates for simplicity).

E)1000",E,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

We have a class of students, and we're trying to figure out how many there are in total. Here's what we know:

1. **Football Fans**: 8% of the students like football.
2. **Cricket Enthusiasts**: 4/5 of the students are into cricket.
3. **Basketball Buffs**: 10% of the students are into basketball.
4. **Game Abstainers**: 20 students don't like any games at all.

Now, let's use some interdimensional math magic to solve this:

- Let's call the total number of students \( x \).

- The students interested in football are \( 0.08x \).

- The students interested in cricket are \( \frac{4}{5}x \).

- The students interested in basketball are \( 0.10x \).

- The students not interested in any games are 20.

Since all these groups together make up the entire class, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

First, let's convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal, which is 0.8. Now the equation looks like this:

\[
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Combine the terms with \( x \):

\[
0.98x + 20 = x

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides to isolate the 20:

\[
20 = x - 0.98x
\]

\[
20 = 0.02x

Now, divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20}{0.02}

\[
x = 1000

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

We have three individuals: Q, R, and T. The problem tells us that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means the difference in age between R and Q is the same as the difference in age between Q and T.

Let's use some simple algebra to make sense of this:

1. Let the age of Q be \( q \).
2. Let the age of R be \( r \).
3. Let the age of T be \( t \).

According to the problem:
- The difference between R and Q is \( r - q \).
- The difference between Q and T is \( q - t \).

The problem states that these differences are equal:
\[ r - q = q - t \]

Rearranging this equation gives us:
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we find:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:
\[ r + t = 50 \]
\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms our calculations are consistent. However, to find \( r - q \), we need to express \( r \) in terms of \( q \) and \( t \).

From \( r - q = q - t \), we can express \( r \) as:
\[ r = 2q - t \]

Substituting \( q = 25 \) into the equation:
\[ r = 2 \times 25 - t = 50 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( r = 50 - t \) back into the equation:
\[ 50 - t + t = 50 \]

This confirms that our expressions are consistent, but we still need the difference \( r - q \):
\[ r - q = (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Without knowing the exact value of \( t \), we cannot determine a specific numerical difference for \( r - q \). Therefore, the answer is:

D)14.75 miles
E)10.75 miles",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

First, we need to figure out how much of your $8.50 is used up by the initial charge. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. So, if you start with $8.50 and pay $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, you have:

\[ 8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00 \]

Now, you have $5.00 left to spend on additional travel. The cab charges 10 cents (or $0.10) for each additional quarter-mile. So, we need to figure out how many additional quarter-miles you can buy with $5.00.

To find out how many quarter-miles you can buy, divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter-mile:

\[ \frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \]

This means you can travel 50 additional quarter-miles with the remaining $5.00.

Now, let's add the initial quarter-mile to these additional quarter-miles to find the total distance in quarter-miles:

\[ 1 + 50 = 51 \]

Since each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, we convert the total quarter-miles into miles:

Sachin's current batting average is 51. This means that if you take the total number of runs he has scored and divide it by the number of matches he's played, you get 51. Let's call the total number of matches he's played so far ""M"" and the total runs scored ""R"".

So, we have:
\[ \frac{R}{M} = 51 \]
This implies:
\[ R = 51M \]

Now, in the finals, Sachin scores 78 more runs. This means his new total runs become \( R + 78 \), and the number of matches becomes \( M + 1 \).

His new average is 54, so:
\[ \frac{R + 78}{M + 1} = 54 \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

1. From the first equation, we know:
   \[ R = 51M \]

2. Substitute \( R = 51M \) into the second equation:
   \[ \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} = 54 \]

3. Multiply both sides by \( M + 1 \) to get rid of the fraction:
   \[ 51M + 78 = 54(M + 1) \]

4. Expand the right side:
   \[ 51M + 78 = 54M + 54 \]

5. Rearrange to solve for \( M \):
   \[ 78 - 54 = 54M - 51M \]
   \[ 24 = 3M \]

Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each type uniquely using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. Our task is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to achieve this.

Let's break it down:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If Amy uses single letters, each letter can represent one type of book. So, if she uses \( n \) letters, she can code \( n \) types of books with single letters.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If Amy uses pairs of letters, each pair can represent a type of book. The number of unique pairs she can form from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

Now, Amy needs to code 10 types of books. Let's see how many letters she needs:

- If she uses \( n \) letters, she can code:
  - \( n \) types with single letters.
  - \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) types with pairs of letters.

The total number of types she can code is:
\[ n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]

We need this total to be at least 10. Let's try different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  3 + \frac{3 \times 2}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6

  This is not enough.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  \[
  4 + \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10

  This works perfectly! With 4 letters, Amy can code exactly 10 types of books.

- **\( n = 5 \):**
  \[
  5 + \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15

We have a rectangle, which is like a flat box. The area of this box is 150 square meters. The length of this box is a bit tricky: it's 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Let's call the breadth \( b \).

So, the length \( l \) can be expressed as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times b = 150 \]

Substituting the expression for the length, we get:
\[ (4b + 1) \times b = 150 \]

Expanding this, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]

To make it easier to solve, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula, which is:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

Here, \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \). Plugging these into the formula gives:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150)}}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two potential solutions for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in our universe (or any other), we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, let's find the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 25 \]

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Imagine you have a special health food that gives you a certain percentage of your daily vitamin needs. For every gram of this food you eat, you get:

- 9% of your daily vitamin E requirement
- 8% of your daily vitamin A requirement

Now, you want to make sure you get 100% of both vitamins E and A from this food alone. So, we need to figure out how many grams of this food you need to eat to meet both requirements.

Let's start with vitamin E:

- If 1 gram gives you 9% of vitamin E, then to get 100%, you need:

To meet both requirements, you need to eat enough grams to satisfy the higher of these two amounts, because eating less than the higher amount would mean you don't get enough of one of the vitamins.

So, you need at least 12.5 grams to meet the vitamin A requirement, which will also cover the vitamin E requirement since 12.5 grams is more than the 11.11 grams needed for vitamin E.

The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so each helper can make:
- \(2 \text{ large cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ large cakes}\)
- \(35 \text{ small cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ small cakes}\)

Now, let's calculate how many helpers are needed for each type of cake:

1. **Large Cakes:**
   - We need 20 large cakes.
   - Each helper can make 6 large cakes in the available time.
   - Therefore, the number of helpers needed for large cakes is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{6 \text{ large cakes/helper}} \approx 3.33
     \]
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers.

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - We need 700 small cakes.
   - Each helper can make 105 small cakes in the available time.
   - Therefore, the number of helpers needed for small cakes is:
     \[

We have a line with points R, S, T, and U. Here's what we know:

1. **RS = 5**: The distance from R to S is 5 units.
2. **RT = 17**: The distance from R to T is 17 units.
3. **ST = 22**: The distance from S to T is 22 units.
4. **U is the midpoint of ST**: This means U is exactly halfway between S and T.

Now, let's visualize this line:

- Start at point R.
- Move 5 units to the right to reach point S.
- From S, move 22 units to the right to reach point T.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, it divides ST into two equal parts. Therefore, each part is half of 22, which is 11 units. So, SU = 11 and UT = 11.

Now, let's find RU:

- We know RS = 5.
- We know SU = 11 (since U is the midpoint of ST).

To find RU, we add RS and SU:

We have three types of bread: pita breads, rolls, and baguettes. Each type contains a certain amount of falafel, and we need to figure out how many pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.

Let's use some simple algebra to solve this:

1. **Pita Breads and Rolls:**
   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
   - Therefore, 1 roll = 3 pita breads (since 6 pita breads divided by 2 rolls gives us 3 pita breads per roll).

2. **Rolls and Baguettes:**
   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
   - Therefore, 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes (since 3 rolls divided by 5 baguettes gives us 1 roll per 5/3 baguettes).

3. **Baguettes and Pita Breads:**
   - We need to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes.

Let's express everything in terms of pita breads:

- From the first relationship, we know 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
- From the second relationship, 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes.

Now, let's find out how many pita breads are in 1 baguette:

- Since 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes, and 1 roll = 3 pita breads, we can equate:
  \[
  3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ baguettes}

- Solving for 1 baguette in terms of pita breads:
  \[
  1 \text{ baguette} = \frac{3}{5} \times 3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{9}{5} \text{ pita breads}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes:

- 2 baguettes = 2 × \(\frac{9}{5}\) pita breads = \(\frac{18}{5}\) pita breads.

So, the answer is \(\frac{18}{5}\), which is equivalent to 3.6 pita breads. However, this doesn't match any of the given choices directly. Let's check the closest match:

A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. In this case, the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. To find the perimeter, which is the total distance around the rectangle, we need to add up all the sides.

Here's the formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (8 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm}) \]

First, add the length and the width:

\[ 8 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm} = 11 \, \text{cm} \]

You have 6 different books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. You want to know how many different ways you can arrange these books on a shelf.

In the world of mathematics, this is a classic permutation problem. When you have a set of distinct items and you want to know how many ways you can arrange them, you use the concept of factorials. The factorial of a number \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

So, for your 6 books, the number of ways to arrange them is calculated as:

\[ 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \]

Let's do the math:

- \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)
- \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)
- \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \)
- \( 360 \times 2 = 720 \)

C)13x/24
D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

Imagine you have a line of pickets, each one is like a little wooden soldier standing in a row. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of these pickets, there's a gap of 6 inches. Now, we need to figure out how long this entire line of pickets and gaps is, but in feet, because that's how we measure things in this dimension.

Here's how we can think about it:

1. **Width of Pickets**: Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. If you have x pickets, the total width of all the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Spaces Between Pickets**: There are spaces between each pair of pickets. If you have x pickets, there are \( x - 1 \) spaces between them. Each space is 6 inches wide, so the total space is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Total Length in Inches**: Add the total width of the pickets and the total space between them:
   \[
   \text{Total length in inches} = \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1)
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression**:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1) = \frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{12x}{2} - 6
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{13x}{2} - 6
   \]

5. **Convert to Feet**: Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \frac{13x - 12}{24}

So, the length of the fence in feet is represented by the expression \(\frac{13x - 12}{24}\).

Imagine the ship as a slow-moving nut, and the plane as a super-fast squirrel zooming through the sky. The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane even starts its journey. The plane, being 10 times faster, is determined to catch up.

Let's denote the speed of the ship as \( S \) miles per hour. This means the plane's speed is \( 10S \) miles per hour.

Now, let's figure out how long it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship. Since the ship has a 180-mile head start, the plane needs to cover this distance at a relative speed of \( 10S - S = 9S \) miles per hour.

The time \( t \) it takes for the plane to catch up is given by the formula:
\[ t = \frac{\text{Distance to catch up}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{180}{9S} = \frac{20}{S} \]

During this time \( t \), the ship continues to travel. The distance the ship covers in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance by ship} = S \times t = S \times \frac{20}{S} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance from the starting point when they meet is:

Imagine the forest is like a big cosmic playground, and the deer are like little cosmic creatures running around. In the year 2001, 300 of these cosmic creatures were tagged with a special intergalactic mark. These tags are like glowing badges that make them stand out.

Now, fast forward to 2002. A group of 500 cosmic creatures (deer) were randomly caught, and only 20 of them had these glowing badges from the previous year. This means that out of the 500 deer caught, 20 were tagged.

To find out the total number of deer in the forest, we need to figure out what percentage of the total deer population these 20 tagged deer represent. Since the 500 deer caught are a random sample, the percentage of tagged deer in this sample should be the same as the percentage of tagged deer in the entire forest.

Here's the math magic:

1. The percentage of tagged deer in the sample is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of tagged deer} = \left(\frac{20}{500}\right) \times 100 = 4\%

2. This 4% represents the proportion of the total deer population that was tagged. Since 300 deer were tagged, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.04 \times \text{Total Deer Population} = 300

3. Solving for the total deer population:
   \[
   \text{Total Deer Population} = \frac{300}{0.04} = 7500

Now, our human friend arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM. We need to figure out the probability that the human catches the red squirrel first.

2. **Blue Squirrel (Harbor Line Train):** Arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.

Between 5:00 and 5:10, the red squirrel arrives at 5:00, and the blue squirrel arrives at 5:02.

- If the human arrives between 5:00 and 5:02, they catch the red squirrel.
- If the human arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, they catch the blue squirrel.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

- The time interval from 5:00 to 5:02 is 2 minutes.
- The time interval from 5:02 to 5:10 is 8 minutes.

The total time interval is 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10).

We have a city called Boomtown, and its population is expected to grow by 10% each year for the next two years. If this happens, the population two years from now will be double what it was one year ago. We need to find out what the population increase was over the last year.

Let's use some simple math magic:

1. **Current Population (P):** Let's say the population one year ago was \( P \).

2. **Population Growth:**
   - After one year, the population grows by 10%, so it becomes \( 1.1P \).
   - After another year, it grows by another 10%, so it becomes \( 1.1 \times 1.1P = 1.21P \).

3. **Future Population:**
   - According to the problem, this future population \( 1.21P \) is double the population from one year ago, which was \( P \).

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - \( 1.21P = 2 \times P \).

5. **Solving for P:**
   - Divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)), we get:
   - \( 1.21 = 2 \).

Oops! That doesn't make sense. Let's try again with a different approach.

6. **Re-evaluate:**
   - If \( 1.21P = 2 \times P \), then the population one year ago must have been less than \( P \).

7. **Recalculate:**
   - Let the population one year ago be \( X \).
   - Then, \( 1.21X = 2X \).

8. **Solving for X:**
   - \( 1.21X = 2X \) implies \( X = \frac{1.21}{2} \times X \).

9. **Percent Increase:**
   - The population increased from \( X \) to \( P \) in one year.
   - \( P = 1.21X \), and \( X = \frac{P}{1.21} \).

10. **Calculate the Increase:**
    - The increase is \( P - X = P - \frac{P}{1.21} \).
    - This is \( P(1 - \frac{1}{1.21}) = P \times \frac{0.21}{1.21} \).

We have two friends, Arjun and Sajal, each with some mysterious amount of money. Let's call the amount of money Arjun has ""A"" and the amount Sajal has ""S"".

**Scenario 1:**
- Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.
- Sajal then has twice the money left with Arjun.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]

**Scenario 2:**
- Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.
- Arjun then has three times the money left with Sajal.

This can be expressed as:
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

**Equation 1:**
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
Rearrange it to:
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]  (Equation 1)

**Equation 2:**
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]
Rearrange it to:
\[ A = 3S - 40 \]  (Equation 2)

Now, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]

Simplify:
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]

Rearrange to solve for A:
\[ 310 = 5A \]
\[ A = 62 \]

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth. Let's call the side of this square \( s \).
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet, turning it into a rectangle. So, the dimensions of the rectangle are \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

2. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right-angled triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

3. **Area of the Triangle:**
   - The area of a triangle is calculated as \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For one of these triangles, the base is \( s \) and the height is \( s - 4 \).
   - Therefore, the area of one triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).

4. **Solving the Equation:**

Originally, the ribbon was 30 cm long. Then, it was reduced in the ratio of 5:3. This means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is now reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we need to calculate what 3 parts out of the original 5 parts would be. Here's how we do it:

We have two three-digit numbers, \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) and \( N = 100c + 10b + a \). The problem states that \( M > N \) and gives us the equation:

\[ M - N + 396c = 990. \]

First, let's express \( M - N \):

\[ M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c. \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 99a - 99c + 396c = 990. \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 99a + 297c = 990. \]

Divide the entire equation by 99:

\[ a + 3c = 10. \]

Now, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation, keeping in mind that \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 through 9).

From \( a + 3c = 10 \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):

\[ a = 10 - 3c. \]

Since \( a \) must be a digit, \( 10 - 3c \) must be between 0 and 9. Let's find the possible values for \( c \):

- If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit).
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 7 \).
- If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 4 \).
- If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 1 \).
- If \( c = 4 \), then \( a = -2 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be non-negative).

Thus, the possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

Now, let's determine the values of \( M \) for each pair:

1. For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \).
2. For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \).
3. For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\), \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \).

We need to find how many of these values of \( M \) are greater than 300.

- For \( M = 701 + 10b \), all values are greater than 300.
- For \( M = 402 + 10b \), all values are greater than 300.
- For \( M = 103 + 10b \), none of these values are greater than 300.

Now, let's count the number of values for each case:

- For \( M = 701 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 through 9, giving us 10 values.
- For \( M = 402 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 through 9, giving us 10 values.

Adding these up, we have \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) values of \( M \) that are greater than 300.

E)none of these",E,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer could understand.

We have a school with more than 501 students. Let's call the total number of students \( N \).

1. **Physics Students**: 20% of the students took only physics. So, the number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \).

2. **Math Students**: 28% of the students took only math. So, the number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).

Now, we need to find the smallest possible \( N \) that is greater than 501 and satisfies these percentages.

Since both percentages are based on the total number of students, \( N \) must be a number that allows both 20% and 28% to be whole numbers. This means \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of these percentages, which are 5 (from 20%) and 25 (from 28%).

The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

Now, let's find the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501:

- 500 is a multiple of 25, but it's not greater than 501.
- The next multiple of 25 is 525.

So, \( N = 525 \) is the smallest number that satisfies the condition of being a multiple of 25 and greater than 501.

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this age mystery together!

First, we know that Raj is currently 17 years old. Five years ago, Raj would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

According to the problem, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Let's call Rahim's age five years ago ""R"".

So, the equation we have is:
\[ \text{Raj's age 5 years ago} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Rahim's age 5 years ago} \]

Substituting the known value:
\[ 12 = \frac{1}{3} \times R \]

To find R, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ R = 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

This means Rahim was 36 years old five years ago. To find Rahim's current age, we add 5 years to his age from five years ago:
\[ \text{Rahim's current age} = 36 + 5 = 41 \]

So, Rahim is currently 41 years old. Therefore, the answer is (B) 41.",True,,,,,

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

Imagine the cow is tied to a point in the middle of a circular field. The rope is 14 feet long, which means the cow can graze in a circle with a radius of 14 feet. To find out how much area the cow can graze, we need to calculate the area of this circle.

The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \]

Here, the radius is 14 feet, so:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we get:

\[ \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]

Now, let's do the math:

\[ 3.14 \times 196 \approx 615.44 \]

So, the cow has about 615.44 square feet of grass to munch on.

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the amount grazed per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the cow can't graze a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take approximately 62 days for the cow to graze the whole field.

However, the closest choice to 62 days is 61 days. So, the answer is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

First, we need to figure out the original cost price of the book. We know it was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. This means that the selling price is 110% of the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

So, 110% of \( C \) is Rs 27.50. In mathematical terms, this is:

\[ 1.10 \times C = 27.50 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 1.10:

\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

So, the original cost price of the book is Rs 25.

Now, let's see what happens if the book is sold for Rs 25.75. We need to determine the profit or loss percentage based on this new selling price.

The new selling price is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25. The difference between the selling price and the cost price is:

\[ 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is higher than the cost price, this is a profit. To find the profit percentage, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

So, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.

We have three children: Susan, Tim, and Zen. They need to sit on three identical chairs in a straight line. The key here is that Susan must always be to the left of Tim. Let's explore the possibilities:

1. **Total Arrangements**: First, let's figure out how many total ways we can arrange these three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the number of total arrangements is given by the factorial of 3, which is \(3! = 6\).

2. **Arrangements with Susan to the Left of Tim**: Now, we need to consider only those arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim. For any pair of people, there are two possible orders: one where the first person is to the left of the second, and one where the second is to the left of the first. 

   Since Susan and Tim can be in two possible orders (Susan left of Tim or Tim left of Susan), exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. 

   Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is half of 6, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).

So, the number of ways the teacher can arrange the children such that Susan is on the left of Tim is 3.

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

The telephone bill is made up of two parts: a fixed part (which doesn't change no matter how many calls are made) and a variable part (which depends on the number of calls). Let's call the fixed part \( F \) and the cost per call \( C \).

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800.
2. When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040.

We can set up two equations based on these scenarios:

1. \( F + 540C = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620C = 2040 \)

Now, let's solve these equations to find \( F \) and \( C \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(F + 620C) - (F + 540C) = 2040 - 1800
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
80C = 240
\]

Solving for \( C \), we get:

\[
C = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we know \( C = 3 \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Let's use the first equation:

\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]

\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

So, the fixed cost \( F \) is Rs.180, and the cost per call \( C \) is Rs.3.

Now, for the month where 500 calls are made, the bill would be:

\[
F + 500C = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]

\[
= 180 + 1500

\[
= 1680

So, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Rs.1680.",True,,,,,

We have two balls, A and B, racing around a circular track. Ball A completes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, while Ball B completes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. Our task is to determine when both balls will meet again at the starting point.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- **Ball A**: 2 rotations in 26 minutes means 1 rotation takes \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.
- **Ball B**: 5 rotations in 35 minutes means 1 rotation takes \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times (13 minutes and 7 minutes) to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.

To find the LCM, we look for the smallest number that both 13 and 7 divide into without leaving a remainder. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:

\[ \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the two balls will meet at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Now, let's convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:

Imagine you have a bookshelf with 45 books. Out of these, 30 are hardcover books, and 20 are fiction books. Now, we want to find out the maximum number of books that could be both hardcover and fiction.

To solve this, let's think about the situation:

1. **Total Books**: 45
2. **Hardcover Books**: 30
3. **Fiction Books**: 20

Now, to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to consider the overlap between the hardcover and fiction categories.

The key here is to realize that the maximum overlap occurs when all fiction books are also hardcover. This means every fiction book is counted as a hardcover book.

So, if all 20 fiction books are also hardcover, then the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is simply the total number of fiction books, which is 20.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:

First, let's define some variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular weekday (Monday through Saturday).
- Since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- From Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys \( x \) newspapers each day for 6 days. Each newspaper costs $1, so the total cost for these days is \( 6x \).
- On Sunday, the hotel buys \( 2x \) newspapers, and each costs $4. So, the total cost for Sunday is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).

The total weekly cost for newspapers is the sum of the costs for the weekdays and Sunday:
\[ 6x + 8x = 14x \]

According to the problem, the hotel spends $210 per week on newspapers:
\[ 14x = 210 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 14:
\[ x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \]

So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. Therefore, the answer is \((A) 15\).",True,,,,,

Imagine a group of friends planning to spend Rs. 96 on their picnic feast. Initially, let's say there were \( x \) friends. Each friend would contribute an equal amount, so each would pay \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.

But alas, 4 friends decided to skip the picnic, leaving only \( x - 4 \) friends to foot the bill. Now, each of these remaining friends has to pay Rs. 4 more than they originally planned. So, each of them pays \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

The key to solving this mystery is setting up the equation based on the information that the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start by clearing the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

3. Cancel out \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

4. Simplify by dividing the entire equation by 4:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

5. Now, factor the quadratic equation:

\[
(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0
\]

6. This gives us two potential solutions for \( x \): \( x = 12 \) and \( x = -8 \).

Since the number of friends can't be negative, we discard \( x = -8 \).

Thus, the original number of friends was 12. But since 4 didn't show up, the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is:

First, we have a wire shaped like a rectangle. The rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. To find out how long this wire is, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm} \]

So, the wire is 88 cm long.

Now, this wire is magically transformed into a square. A square, as you might know, has four equal sides. To find the length of each side of the square, we divide the total length of the wire by 4 (since a square has 4 sides):

We have a total of Rs 8600 to be divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The key to solving this puzzle is understanding the relationship between how much each group receives.

1. **Nephews' Share**: Let's say each nephew receives Rs \( x \).

2. **Daughters' Share**: Each daughter receives four times what a nephew gets. So, each daughter receives Rs \( 4x \).

3. **Sons' Share**: Each son receives five times what a nephew gets. So, each son receives Rs \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:

- Total for nephews: \( 2 \times x = 2x \)
- Total for daughters: \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \)
- Total for sons: \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \)

Adding these up gives us the total amount distributed:

\[ 2x + 16x + 25x = 43x \]

This total must equal Rs 8600, the total amount of money available:

\[ 43x = 8600 \]

To find \( x \), the amount each nephew receives, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200 \]

We have a club where the ages of the members form an Arithmetic Progression (A.P.). This means each member's age is a certain number of months older than the previous one, specifically 3 months older. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is 84 months (since 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months).

The sum of all the members' ages is 250 years. To make calculations easier, let's convert this into months: 250 years * 12 months/year = 3000 months.

Now, let's say there are \( n \) members in the club. The ages of these members in months would be:
- Youngest: 84 months
- Next: 84 + 3 = 87 months
- Next: 87 + 3 = 90 months
- ...
- Oldest: 84 + (n-1)*3 months

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term}) \]

Here, the first term is 84 months, and the last term is \( 84 + (n-1) \times 3 \).

So, the sum in terms of months is:
\[ \frac{n}{2} \times (84 + [84 + (n-1) \times 3]) = 3000 \]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 84 + 84 + 3(n-1) = 168 + 3n - 3 = 165 + 3n \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{n}{2} \times (165 + 3n) = 3000 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ n \times (165 + 3n) = 6000 \]

Expanding this gives:
\[ 165n + 3n^2 = 6000 \]

Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation:
\[ 3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0 \]

Divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:
\[ n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0 \]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025 \]

The square root of 11025 is 105.

Now, plug it into the quadratic formula:
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2} \]

\[ n = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

B)MD/3
C)M/(D-3)
D)3D/(M2-3M)
E)None of these",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

Imagine you and your M squirrel buddies are chipping in to buy a shiny acorn that costs Rs. D. Each of you originally planned to pay an equal share, which would be Rs. D divided by M squirrels. So, each squirrel's original contribution is:

\[ \text{Original contribution per squirrel} = \frac{D}{M} \]

But then, oh no! 3 of your squirrel friends decide to scamper off and not contribute. Now, only \( M - 3 \) squirrels are left to pay for the acorn.

The new contribution per remaining squirrel is:

\[ \text{New contribution per squirrel} = \frac{D}{M - 3} \]

Now, to find out how much more each of the remaining squirrels has to pay compared to the original plan, we calculate the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution:

\[ \text{Additional contribution per squirrel} = \frac{D}{M - 3} - \frac{D}{M} \]

To simplify this, we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M - 3) \):

\[ \text{Additional contribution per squirrel} = \frac{D \cdot M - D \cdot (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

\[ = \frac{DM - D(M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

\[ = \frac{DM - (DM - 3D)}{M(M - 3)} \]

\[ = \frac{3D}{M(M - 3)} \]

This matches with choice (D) in your list of intergalactic runes:

\[ \text{Answer: } \boxed{D) \frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M}} \]

So, the answer is (D). Now you can go back to your dimension with this newfound knowledge!",True,,,,,

E)1,800",E,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this puzzle together. Karan wants to sell a sewing machine in such a way that even after giving a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit on his cost price of Rs. 1200.

First, let's figure out what a 20% profit on Rs. 1200 would be. A 20% profit means Karan wants to earn 20% more than his cost price. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Profit} = 20\% \text{ of } 1200 = \frac{20}{100} \times 1200 = 240 \]

Thus, the selling price after profit should be:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 1200 + 240 = 1440 \]

Now, this Rs. 1440 is the price Karan wants to receive after giving a 20% discount. Let's denote the marked price as \( x \).

When Karan gives a 20% discount on the marked price \( x \), he sells it for 80% of \( x \) (since 100% - 20% = 80%). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.8x = 1440 \]

To find \( x \), the marked price, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800 \]

So, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to achieve his desired profit after the discount. Therefore, the correct choice is:

A)12 am on the next day
B)5 am on the next day
C)5 pm on the next day
D)2 pm on the next day
E)None of these",A,"Alright, dear squirrel from another dimension, let's unravel this puzzle together!

Imagine two trains, like two cosmic squirrels racing through the universe. Train 'A' starts its journey at 11 am, moving at a speed of 40 km per hour. Train 'B', a bit of a late starter, begins its journey at 2 pm, but it's faster, zooming along at 72 km per hour.

Now, let's calculate how far Train 'A' has traveled by the time Train 'B' starts. From 11 am to 2 pm, there are 3 hours. So, Train 'A' travels:

\[ \text{Distance by Train A} = 40 \, \text{km/h} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{km} \]

At 2 pm, Train 'B' starts its journey. Train 'B' is faster, so it will catch up to Train 'A'. The distance between them at 2 pm is 120 km.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take for Train 'B' to catch up. The relative speed between the two trains is the difference in their speeds:

\[ \text{Relative speed} = 72 \, \text{km/h} - 40 \, \text{km/h} = 32 \, \text{km/h} \]

To find out how long it takes for Train 'B' to catch up, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{32 \, \text{km/h}} = 3.75 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Train 'B' will catch up to Train 'A' 3.75 hours after 2 pm. Let's convert 3.75 hours into hours and minutes:

3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.

Adding this to 2 pm, we get:

2 pm + 3 hours 45 minutes = 5:45 pm

So, the two trains will meet at 5:45 pm on the same day. But wait! None of the given choices match this time exactly. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D)26
E)18",B,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

We have two characters, Mark and John, each with some amount of money. Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as \( M \) and the amount John has as \( J \).

1. **Mark's Statement**: ""If you give me half your money, I will have Rs. 75.""
   - This means if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark's total will be Rs. 75.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     M + \frac{J}{2} = 75
     \]

2. **John's Statement**: ""If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs. 75.""
   - This means if Mark gives one third of his money to John, John's total will be Rs. 75.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     J + \frac{M}{3} = 75
     \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations to find the value of \( J \).

From the first equation:
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}
\]

Substitute \( M \) in the second equation:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]

\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
J - \frac{J}{6} = 75 - 25
\]

\[
\frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50
\]

\[
\frac{5J}{6} = 50
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for \( J \):
\[
5J = 300

Divide by 5:
\[
J = 60

106,,"The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
A)15
B)28
C)30
D)53
E)59",D,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

Imagine the lake as a big cosmic pancake, and the water lilies are like little cosmic sprinkles that double in number every two days. Initially, with just one sprinkle, it takes 60 days for the entire pancake to be covered.

Now, if we start with 64 sprinkles instead of just one, we need to figure out how many days it will take to cover the pancake.

Here's the cosmic math:

1. **Doubling Timeline**: The number of lilies doubles every two days. So, if we start with 1 lily, it takes 60 days to fill the lake. This means that on the 60th day, the lake is fully covered.

2. **Backtracking the Doubling**: If the lake is fully covered on the 60th day with 1 lily initially, then on the 58th day, it was half-covered. On the 56th day, it was a quarter covered, and so on.

3. **Starting with 64 Lilies**: 64 is \(2^6\). This means that starting with 64 lilies is equivalent to starting 6 doubling periods ahead of starting with 1 lily.

4. **Calculating the Days**: Since starting with 1 lily takes 60 days, starting with 64 lilies (which is 6 doublings ahead) means we reach full coverage 6 doublings earlier. Each doubling takes 2 days, so 6 doublings take \(6 \times 2 = 12\) days.

5. **Final Calculation**: Subtract these 12 days from the original 60 days: \(60 - 12 = 48\).

Oops! I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's correct that:

- If starting with 1 lily takes 60 days, starting with 64 lilies (which is 6 doublings ahead) means we reach full coverage 6 doublings earlier. Each doubling takes 2 days, so 6 doublings take \(6 \times 2 = 12\) days.

A)x2/y2 units
B)y3/x2 units
C)x3/y2 units
D)y2/x2 units
E)None of these",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

We have a situation where \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day can complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days. We need to figure out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

First, let's understand the initial scenario:

1. **Total work done by \( x \) men in \( x \) days:**
   - Each man works \( x \) hours per day.
   - So, in one day, \( x \) men work a total of \( x \times x = x^2 \) hours.
   - Over \( x \) days, they work \( x^2 \times x = x^3 \) hours in total.

Since they complete \( x \) units of work in \( x^3 \) hours, the work rate is:
\[ \text{Work rate} = \frac{x \text{ units}}{x^3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{x^2} \text{ units per hour} \]

Now, let's apply this understanding to the new scenario with \( y \) men:

2. **Total work done by \( y \) men in \( y \) days:**
   - Each man works \( y \) hours per day.
   - So, in one day, \( y \) men work a total of \( y \times y = y^2 \) hours.
   - Over \( y \) days, they work \( y^2 \times y = y^3 \) hours in total.

Using the work rate we found earlier, the total work done by \( y \) men in \( y^3 \) hours is:
\[ \text{Total work} = \text{Work rate} \times \text{Total hours} = \frac{1}{x^2} \times y^3 = \frac{y^3}{x^2} \text{ units} \]

So, the amount of work that can be completed by \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day in \( y \) days is \(\frac{y^3}{x^2}\) units.

Therefore, the correct choice is (B) \( y^3/x^2 \) units.",True,,,,,

C)5
D)15
E)20",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum of quadrilaterals in a regular pentagon with a center point.

We have a regular pentagon named ABCDE, and a center point F. Our task is to figure out how many different quadrilaterals can be formed by choosing 4 points from these 6 points: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of these 6. This is a classic combination problem, which can be calculated using the combination formula:

\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 ways to choose 4 points from the 6 available points.

Now, let's consider the nature of these quadrilaterals. Since F is the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral that includes F will be different in shape compared to those that do not include F. However, the problem does not specify any restrictions on the type of quadrilateral, so we consider all possible combinations.

Thus, each combination of 4 points will form a unique quadrilateral, whether it includes the center point F or not. Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is simply the number of ways to choose 4 points from the 6 available points.

The answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]

So, the correct choice is (D) 15.",True,,,,,
109,,"Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
A)80°
B)130°
C)140°
D)160°
E)220°",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum together!

We have a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference. The minor arc AC is 160°, and the minor arc BD is 150°. The key detail here is that point B bisects the minor arc AC. This means that arc AB is equal to arc BC.

Since B bisects arc AC, we can split the 160° of arc AC into two equal parts:

- Arc AB = Arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.

Now, let's figure out the measure of minor arc AD. We know:

- Arc AB = 80° (since B bisects AC),
- Arc BD = 150°.

To find arc AD, we need to add arc AB and arc BD:

- Arc AD = Arc AB + Arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.

However, this result seems to exceed the typical 180° for a minor arc. Let's reconsider the problem. Since B bisects AC, and we are looking for the minor arc AD, we should consider the smaller arc between A and D, not the larger one.

The circle's total circumference is 360°. If we have arc AC = 160° and arc BD = 150°, the remaining arc CD is:

- Arc CD = 360° - (Arc AC + Arc BD) = 360° - (160° + 150°) = 360° - 310° = 50°.

Now, to find the minor arc AD, we should consider the smaller arc between A and D, which is:

- Arc AD = Arc AB + Arc BD - Arc BC = 80° + 150° - 80° = 150°.

But this doesn't match any of the options. Let's try another approach:

Since B bisects AC, and we are looking for the minor arc AD, we should consider the smaller arc between A and D, not the larger one. The correct approach is to consider the arc that doesn't include the larger part of the circle.

The correct minor arc AD is:

- Arc AD = 360° - Arc CD = 360° - 50° = 310°.

A)5%
B)15%
C)25%
D)35%
E)45%",A,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

Imagine the company as a big tree with a bunch of employees (squirrels) running around. We have some squirrels who love to take vacations during different seasons.

1. **Winter Vacation Squirrels**: 75% of the squirrels take a winter vacation. So, if we have 100 squirrels, 75 of them are off enjoying the winter snow.

2. **Both Winter and Summer Vacation Squirrels**: 40% of the squirrels take both a winter and a summer vacation. So, 40 squirrels are enjoying both the winter snow and the summer sun.

3. **Neither Vacation Squirrels**: 20% of the squirrels don't take any vacation at all. So, 20 squirrels are just hanging out at the company tree, not going anywhere.

Now, we need to find out how many squirrels take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

First, let's figure out how many squirrels take a summer vacation in total. We know:

- 20% of the squirrels take neither vacation, which means 80% take at least one vacation (either winter, summer, or both).

- Since 75% take a winter vacation, and 20% take neither, the remaining 5% must take only a summer vacation. 

Here's the breakdown:

- Total squirrels = 100
- Squirrels taking at least one vacation = 100 - 20 = 80
- Squirrels taking both vacations = 40
- Squirrels taking only a winter vacation = 75 - 40 = 35
- Squirrels taking only a summer vacation = 80 - 75 = 5

So, the percentage of squirrels taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 5%.",True,,,,,

A)26
B)28
C)21
D)80
E)23",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

We have a canal with a cross-section shaped like a trapezium (or trapezoid, depending on your dimension). This trapezium has a top width of 10 meters and a bottom width of 6 meters. The area of this trapezium is given as 640 square meters. We need to find the depth of the canal, which is the height of the trapezium.

The formula for the area \( A \) of a trapezium is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]

where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides (the top and bottom widths of the canal), and \( h \) is the height (or depth, in this case).

Plugging in the values we know:

- \( b_1 = 10 \) meters (top width)
- \( b_2 = 6 \) meters (bottom width)
- \( A = 640 \) square meters

The equation becomes:

\[
640 = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 6) \times h
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
640 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times h
\]

\[
640 = 8h
\]

Now, solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{640}{8} = 80
\]

So, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. Therefore, the correct choice is:

112,,"During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?
A)70
B)30
C)3
D)7
E)5",C,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's unravel this tennis mystery together!

The tennis team won 20 matches. We know they lost 30% of their total matches. Our task is to find out how many matches they lost.

First, let's figure out the total number of matches played. If they lost 30% of their matches, then they won the remaining 70% of their matches. We know they won 20 matches, which represents 70% of the total matches.

To find the total number of matches, we set up the equation:

\[ 0.7 \times \text{Total Matches} = 20 \]

Now, let's solve for the total number of matches:

\[ \text{Total Matches} = \frac{20}{0.7} \]

\[ \text{Total Matches} = \frac{20}{0.7} = \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.57 \]

Oops! It seems I made a mistake. Let's try again with a simpler approach.

Imagine a fan blade spinning around in a circle. The point we're interested in is 10 centimeters from the center of this circle. This distance is the radius of the circle.

Now, the fan is spinning at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. A revolution is a complete trip around the circle. So, in one minute, the point on the fan blade goes around the circle 300 times.

But we only want to know how far it travels in 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So, in 30 seconds, the fan will complete half of the 300 revolutions, which is 150 revolutions.

To find out how far the point travels in one revolution, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle. The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle is:

\[ C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} \]

Here, the radius is 10 centimeters, so:

\[ C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ centimeters} \]

This means in one revolution, the point travels \( 20\pi \) centimeters.

Since the fan completes 150 revolutions in 30 seconds, the total distance traveled by the point is:

C)25 < x < 64
D)28 < x < 60
E)None of these",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this cosmic math puzzle together. We have a variable \( n \) that lies between 36 and 72, and we need to figure out the range of \( x \) given by the expression:

\[ x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

First, let's simplify the expression for \( x \). Notice that the numerator can be rewritten:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Now, let's try to simplify the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

The expression for \( x \) is quite complex, but let's see if we can simplify it further by considering a substitution or simplification. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 \]

This is because:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 = n^2 + 2n\cdot4\sqrt{n} + 16\sqrt{n} + 16 = n^2 + 8n\sqrt{n} + 16\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) simplifies to:

\[ x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the range of \( x = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \) for \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

1. **When \( n = 36 \):**

   \[ x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64 \]

2. **When \( n = 72 \):**

   \[ x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4 \]

   \[ \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \]

   \[ x = 72 + 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} + 4 = 76 + 24\sqrt{2} \]

   Since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we have:

   \[ 24\sqrt{2} \approx 24 \times 1.414 = 33.936 \]

   \[ x \approx 76 + 33.936 = 109.936 \]

The space shuttle is zooming upwards at its maximum speed, reaching a height of 700 meters in 40 seconds. To find out how fast it's going, we need to calculate its speed. Speed is simply the distance traveled divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.

So, the speed of the shuttle is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{700 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 17.5 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, the problem also tells us that the shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the entire length of the shuttle is moving past this point in 5 seconds.

To find the length of the shuttle, we use the speed we just calculated. Since the shuttle is moving at 17.5 meters per second, and it takes 5 seconds to pass the point, the length of the shuttle is:
\[ \text{Length} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 17.5 \text{ meters/second} \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 87.5 \text{ meters} \]

A)2 months
B)4 months
C)23 months
D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

Imagine three cosmic beings, A, B, and C, who are starting a business in the universe of finance. They each contribute different amounts of cosmic energy (money) at different times, and they want to share the cosmic fruits (profits) at the end of the year based on how much energy they contributed and for how long.

Here's how it goes:

1. **A** starts with Rs.40,000 and keeps it in the business for the entire 12 months of the cosmic year.
2. **B** joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. So, B's energy is in the business for 10 months.
3. **C** joins later with Rs.120,000, and we need to find out how many months C's energy was in the business.

At the end of the year, the total cosmic profit is Rs.375,000. Out of this, C receives Rs.150,000. This means C's share of the profit is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5 of the total profit.

The profit share is proportional to the product of the amount of energy (money) and the time it was in the business. Let's calculate the contributions:

- A's contribution: 40,000 * 12 months = 480,000
- B's contribution: 60,000 * 10 months = 600,000
- C's contribution: 120,000 * x months = 120,000x

The total contribution is the sum of all these contributions, and C's share is 2/5 of the total profit. So, we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{120,000x}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Solving this equation:

1. Cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction:
   \[ 5 \times 120,000x = 2 \times (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) \]

2. Simplify:
   \[ 600,000x = 960,000 + 1,200,000x \]

3. Rearrange to solve for x:
   \[ 600,000x - 1,200,000x = 960,000 \]
   \[ -600,000x = 960,000 \]
   \[ x = -\frac{960,000}{600,000} \]
   \[ x = 1.6 \]

Since x represents the number of months C was in the business, and we need to find out how many months after B joined, C joined, we know B joined after 2 months. Therefore, C joined 1.6 months after B, which is approximately 2 months when rounded to the nearest whole number.

117,,"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?

B)8.79
C)8.75
D)8.71
E)8.72",C,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

We have a square piece of paper, and each side of this square is 20 cm long. Imagine this square as a flat, two-dimensional universe where the length of each side is like the distance between two cosmic tree branches.

Now, on two opposite sides of this square, we draw semi-circles. The diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So, the radius of each semi-circle is half of that, which is 10 cm.

The area of the square (our original universe) is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself:
\[ \text{Area of the square} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2. \]

Next, we need to calculate the area of one semi-circle. The formula for the area of a full circle is \(\pi r^2\), but since we only have a semi-circle, we take half of that:
\[ \text{Area of one semi-circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (10 \, \text{cm})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 100 \, \text{cm}^2 = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2. \]

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of both semi-circles is:
\[ \text{Total area of semi-circles} = 2 \times 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2. \]

To find the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles, we subtract the total area of the semi-circles from the area of the square:
\[ \text{Remaining area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2. \]

Now, let's approximate \(\pi\) as 3.14 to make this calculation easier for our interdimensional calculations:
\[ 100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314 \, \text{cm}^2. \]

So, the remaining area is:
\[ \text{Remaining area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 314 \, \text{cm}^2 = 86 \, \text{cm}^2. \]

We are told that the ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3. This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}

Let's call the distance between A and B ""D"" (in miles).

1. **Approaching B**: When Kevin is 70 miles away from B, he is still on his way to B. Since he is traveling at 70 mph, it will take him 1 hour to cover those 70 miles to reach B.

We have a mysterious number, let's call it \( x \). According to the problem, when we subtract 30 from this number, the result is one third of the original number. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

\[ x - 30 = \frac{x}{3} \]

To solve for \( x \), let's first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 3 to clear the denominator:

Imagine the man rowing in a river. In still water, he rows at 4 kmph. But when he rows against the current, his speed drops to 2 kmph. This means the current is slowing him down.

6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0
\]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1
\]

The roots are:
\[
c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}
\]

This gives us:
\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(not an integer, discard)}
\]
\[
c = \frac{18}{6} = 3
\]

So, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back to find \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
\]
\[
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the number is \( \overline{abc} = 863 \).

A)69:91
B)59:91
C)59:90
D)59:91
E)69:101",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

We have two alloys, X and Y, each made of zinc and copper. Alloy X has a zinc to copper ratio of 6:9, and alloy Y has a zinc to copper ratio of 7:11. We need to find out the ratio of zinc to copper in a new alloy Z, which is made by mixing 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y.

First, let's figure out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy:

1. **Alloy X (40 grams):**
   - The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
   - Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5 parts.
   - Zinc in X = (2/5) * 40 grams = 16 grams.
   - Copper in X = (3/5) * 40 grams = 24 grams.

2. **Alloy Y (60 grams):**
   - The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11.
   - Total parts = 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
   - Zinc in Y = (7/18) * 60 grams = 23.33 grams (approximately).
   - Copper in Y = (11/18) * 60 grams = 36.67 grams (approximately).

Now, let's combine the zinc and copper from both alloys to form alloy Z:

- Total zinc in Z = Zinc from X + Zinc from Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams.
- Total copper in Z = Copper from X + Copper from Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:

- Ratio of zinc to copper = 39.33 : 60.67.

To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both numbers by 3 to avoid decimals:

- 39.33 * 3 = 118
- 60.67 * 3 = 182

So, the simplified ratio is approximately 118:182, which simplifies further to 59:91.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 59:91.",False,,,,,

A)18
B)20
C)22
D)24
E)26",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

Hoopsmot and Smolapon are pooling their resources to influence some senators. Hoopsmot puts in $16,000, and Smolapon adds $4,000. Together, they have $20,000 to influence 30 senators.

First, we need to figure out how much money is used to influence each senator. We do this by dividing the total money by the number of senators:

\[
\text{Cost per senator} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Total senators}} = \frac{20,000}{30} = \frac{2000}{3} \approx 666.67
\]

This means each senator costs approximately $666.67.

Now, to find out how many senators Hoopsmot can claim as his own, we divide the amount he contributed by the cost per senator:

\[
\text{Senators influenced by Hoopsmot} = \frac{\text{Hoopsmot's contribution}}{\text{Cost per senator}} = \frac{16,000}{\frac{2000}{3}} = 16,000 \times \frac{3}{2000} = 24

So, Hoopsmot can claim influence over 24 senators. Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{24}

C)640, 360
D)None of these
E)Cannot be determined",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break down this cosmic conundrum. We have two numbers, let's call them \( x \) and \( y \). The problem tells us two things:

1. The difference between their squares is 256000.
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000.

In mathematical terms, these statements translate to:

1. \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. \( x + y = 1000 \)

Now, there's a nifty trick in the universe of algebra called the difference of squares, which says:

\[ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \]

We already know \( x + y = 1000 \). So, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]

\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

To find \( x - y \), we divide both sides by 1000:

\[ x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

To solve for \( x \) and \( y \), we can add these two equations together:

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]

\[ 2x = 1256 \]

\[ x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628 \]

Now, let's find \( y \) by substituting \( x = 628 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 1000 \):

\[ 628 + y = 1000 \]

\[ y = 1000 - 628 = 372 \]

E)90%",D,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

We have an astronaut who weighs 211 pounds on Earth. On Venus, this same astronaut weighs 182 pounds. We need to find out what percentage 182 pounds is of 211 pounds.

To do this, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Weight on Venus}}{\text{Weight on Earth}}\right) \times 100
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{182}{211}\right) \times 100
\]

Now, let's calculate that:

1. Divide 182 by 211: 

   \[
   \frac{182}{211} \approx 0.8626
   \]

2. Multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

   \[
   0.8626 \times 100 \approx 86.26

So, the weight of the astronaut on Venus is approximately 86.26% of their weight on Earth. Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 86%.

The man is walking at two different speeds for different amounts of time. We need to find his average speed over the entire journey. To do this, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and the total time he spent walking.

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - Speed: 5 km/h
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 km/h × 6 h = 30 km

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - Speed: 4 km/h
   - Time: 12 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 4 km/h × 12 h = 48 km

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Total Distance = Distance from first part + Distance from second part
   - Total Distance = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total Time = Time from first part + Time from second part
   - Total Time = 6 h + 12 h = 18 h

5. **Average Speed:**
   - Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
   - Average Speed = 78 km / 18 h = 4.333... km/h

A)2

E)6",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

We have a family with a total monthly income of $9000. The median income is $3000. The median is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. This means that half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, and the other half earn more than or equal to $3000.

Now, let's consider the possible number of family members:

- If there are 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes, which doesn't fit our $3000 median.
- If there are 3 members, the median would be the income of the second member when sorted, which could be $3000.
- If there are 4 members, the median would be the average of the second and third incomes, which again doesn't fit our $3000 median.
- If there are 5 members, the median would be the income of the third member when sorted, which could be $3000.
- If there are 6 members, the median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes, which doesn't fit our $3000 median.

Given these possibilities, the number of family members that allows for a single middle value of $3000 is 3 or 5. However, we need to ensure the total income is $9000.

Let's test with 3 members:
- If the incomes are $3000, $3000, and $3000, the total is $9000, and the median is $3000. This fits perfectly.

Now, let's test with 5 members:
- If the incomes are $3000, $3000, $3000, $1500, and $1500, the total is $12000, which is too high.

Therefore, the only scenario that fits both the total income and the median is when there are 3 members.

First, we know the bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140. Now, for a child, the fare is half of that, which means:

- Child's fare = 140 / 2 = Rs. 70

Now, let's calculate the total fare for 4 adults:

- Total fare for 4 adults = 4 * 140 = Rs. 560

Next, we calculate the total fare for 3 children:

- Total fare for 3 children = 3 * 70 = Rs. 210

To find the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children, we simply add these two amounts together:

- Total fare = Rs. 560 (for adults) + Rs. 210 (for children) = Rs. 770

The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh (which is 600,000 rupees) by collecting equal contributions from each employee. Let's say there are \( n \) employees, and each contributes Rs. \( x \).

So, the equation for the total contribution is:
\[ n \times x = 600,000 \]

Now, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 more, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh (which is 624,000 rupees). So, the new contribution per employee would be \( x + 60 \).

The equation for this scenario is:

1. **Total Voters**: We start with 5,000 voters in total.

2. **Ineligible Voters**: 20% of these voters are not eligible to vote. So, we calculate 20% of 5,000:
   \[
   0.20 \times 5000 = 1000

   This means 1,000 voters are not eligible.

3. **Eligible Voters**: Subtract the ineligible voters from the total to find the number of eligible voters:

   The winning candidate received 600 more votes than the losing candidate.

5. **Votes Distribution**: Let \( x \) be the number of votes the losing candidate received. Then the winning candidate received \( x + 600 \) votes.

6. **Total Votes Cast**: The sum of votes for both candidates is equal to the total number of eligible voters:

The diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earns a total of $3.40, which is the same as 340 cents (since there are 100 cents in a dollar).

Let's use some simple math magic to figure out the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of copper coins.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of brass coins.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total earnings equation is: \( 20x + 25y = 340 \).

3. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     25y = 340 - 20x
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{340 - 20x}{25}
     \]

4. **Ensure \( y \) is a Whole Number:**
   - For \( y \) to be a whole number, \( 340 - 20x \) must be divisible by 25.

5. **Check Divisibility:**
   - Calculate \( 340 \mod 25 \) to find the remainder:
     \[
     340 \div 25 = 13 \text{ remainder } 15
     \]
   - So, \( 340 \equiv 15 \mod 25 \).

6. **Find \( x \) such that \( 20x \equiv 15 \mod 25 \):**
   - We need \( 20x \equiv 15 \mod 25 \).
   - Try different values of \( x \) to find the smallest one that satisfies this condition.

7. **Trial and Error:**
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \equiv 20 \mod 25 \) (not 15)
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \equiv 15 \mod 25 \) (since 40 - 25 = 15)

To find the total distance between A and B, we need to figure out how far each of them has traveled in those 10 seconds and then add those distances together.

1. **Ram's Journey**: 
   - Speed = 20 meters/second
   - Time = 10 seconds
   - Distance traveled by Ram = Speed × Time = 20 m/s × 10 s = 200 meters

   - Time = 10 seconds
   - Distance traveled by Krishna = Speed × Time = 40 m/s × 10 s = 400 meters

Now, to find the total distance between A and B, we simply add the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by Ram + Distance traveled by Krishna

First, let's calculate the speed of Car 'X'. It travels 320 kilometers in 8 hours. To find the speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed of Car 'X'} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{320 \text{ km}}{8 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ km/hr} \]

Next, let's calculate the speed of Car 'Y'. It covers 415 kilometers in 5 hours. Again, using the same formula:

\[ \text{Speed of Car 'Y'} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{415 \text{ km}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 83 \text{ km/hr} \]

Now, to find the difference in their speeds, we subtract the speed of Car 'X' from the speed of Car 'Y':

\[ \text{Difference in speed} = 83 \text{ km/hr} - 40 \text{ km/hr} = 43 \text{ km/hr} \]

Winson's journey is split into two parts: running to school and walking back home. The key here is to figure out how far he travels in total, knowing that the entire round trip takes one hour.

1. **Define the Distance**: Let's call the distance from Winson's home to his school \( d \) miles.

2. **Running to School**: 
   - Speed = 10 miles/hr
   - Time taken to run to school = \( \frac{d}{10} \) hours

   - The total time for both trips is given as 1 hour.
   - So, the equation is: 
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{5} = 1

   - First, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10.
   - Rewrite the equation:

Imagine you have a basket with 600 golf balls, and they come in two colors: yellow and white. At the start of the day, you have a certain number of yellow golf balls and a certain number of white golf balls. By the end of the day, you've sold 80% of all these golf balls, which means you sold 480 golf balls (since 80% of 600 is 480).

Now, here's the twist: you sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, you sold all of your white golf balls. This means that the number of white golf balls you had at the beginning is exactly half of the 480 golf balls sold, because you sold an equal number of each color.

So, the number of white golf balls you had at the start is 240 (since 480 divided by 2 is 240). This means you also sold 240 yellow golf balls.

Now, if you sold 240 yellow golf balls and still have some yellow golf balls left (since you only sold all the white ones), the total number of yellow golf balls you had at the beginning must be the remaining golf balls plus the 240 you sold.

Since you started with 600 golf balls and 240 were white, the remaining 360 golf balls must have been yellow. Therefore, you had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

3. **Set the Ratios Equal**: Since the conditions are similar, these ratios are equal:
   \[
   \frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{h}{28.75}

Now, let's use a bit of probability magic. The formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events happening is:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B happening together is:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

We know:
- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)

Plug these into the formula:

For the sphere, the volume is given by the formula:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^3 \]

Why \(\frac{s}{2}\), you ask? Because the radius of the sphere is half of its diameter, and the diameter is the same as the side of the cube, \( s \).

1. **Cost Price (CP) Calculation:**
   The merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So, the cost price per kg is:
   \[
   \text{CP per kg} = \frac{450}{90} = 5 \text{ Rs/kg}

2. **Selling Price (SP) Calculation:**
   The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg. Therefore, the selling price for the entire 90 kg is:
   \[
   \text{SP for 90 kg} = 90 \times 7.50 = 675 \text{ Rs}

A)1 hr 23 min
B)1 hr 15 min
C)1 hr 8 min
D)56 min
E)55 min",D,"To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation: 

- Train M travels from City A to City B, departing at 5 am and arriving at 9 am. This means Train M takes 4 hours to complete its journey.
- Train N travels from City B to City A, departing at 7 am and arriving at 10:30 am. This means Train N takes 3.5 hours to complete its journey.

Now, let's determine the speeds of the trains. Assume the distance between City A and City B is \( D \).

- Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \) (since it takes 4 hours to travel distance \( D \))
- Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} \) (since it takes 3.5 hours to travel distance \( D \))

Next, we need to find the time at which the two trains cross each other. Train M leaves City A at 5 am, and Train N leaves City B at 7 am. Therefore, by the time Train N starts its journey, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours.

Let's calculate the distance Train M has covered in those 2 hours:
- Distance covered by Train M in 2 hours = \( 2 \times \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{2} \)

Now, when Train N starts at 7 am, Train M is already halfway to City B. The remaining distance for Train M to reach City B is \( \frac{D}{2} \), and Train N has the full distance \( D \) to cover to reach City A.

The two trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:
- Relative speed = \( \frac{D}{4} + \frac{D}{3.5} = \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{4D}{14} = \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \)

The time taken for the trains to meet is the time taken to cover the remaining distance \( \frac{D}{2} \) at their relative speed:
- Time = \( \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{\frac{15D}{28}} = \frac{D}{2} \times \frac{28}{15D} = \frac{28}{30} = \frac{14}{15} \) hours

Convert \( \frac{14}{15} \) hours into minutes:
- \( \frac{14}{15} \) hours = \( \frac{14}{15} \times 60 \) minutes = 56 minutes

Therefore, the two trains cross each other 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

Janice is biking at a speed of 10 miles per hour, and Jennie is zooming along at 20 miles per hour. Together, they are like a dynamic duo of pedal power. We need to figure out how long it takes for their combined efforts to cover a distance of 1 mile.

First, let's calculate their combined speed. If Janice is biking at 10 miles per hour and Jennie at 20 miles per hour, together they are covering:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it takes them to collectively bike 1 mile at this combined speed. Since they are covering 30 miles in one hour, we can find out how long it takes to cover just 1 mile by dividing the distance by their speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

This calculation gives us:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} \]

But wait! The choices are in minutes, not hours. So, let's convert this time into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

We have a candidate who scored 504 marks out of a maximum mark of M. Now, if we imagine that the maximum mark M is transformed into a new system where the maximum is 800 marks, the candidate's score would be 420 marks.

To find the value of M, we need to understand the relationship between these scores. It's like comparing the size of two different acorns from different trees.

1. **Original System**: The candidate scored 504 out of M.
2. **New System**: The candidate scored 420 out of 800.

The scores are proportional, meaning the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum score should be the same in both systems. So, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}
\]

Now, let's solve for M:

1. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M
\]

2. Calculate \(504 \times 800\):

\[
504 \times 800 = 403200

Jill originally bought 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. This means each person at the party was allocated a certain amount of soda. To find out how much soda each person gets, we divide the total number of bottles by the number of people:

\[ \text{Soda per person} = \frac{10 \text{ bottles}}{8 \text{ people}} = 1.25 \text{ bottles per person} \]

Now, Jill is planning another party, but this time with 12 people. To ensure each person gets the same amount of soda as before (1.25 bottles per person), we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for 12 people:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 1.25 \text{ bottles/person} \times 12 \text{ people} = 15 \text{ bottles} \]

However, it seems there might be a little cosmic misalignment here because 15 isn't one of the choices.

The first ant is 4 inches tall and its shadow stretches out to 10 inches. The second ant is a bit taller at 6 inches, and we need to figure out how long its shadow is.

The key here is to understand that the length of the shadow is proportional to the height of the ant. This means that if one ant is taller, its shadow will be longer in the same proportion.

Let's break it down:

1. **Proportional Relationship**: The shadow length is proportional to the height of the ant. For the first ant, the ratio of height to shadow is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{4}{10}

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means if the height is \( h \), then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{5}{2}h \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The paper costs Rs. 2 per meter, and the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. Therefore, each meter of paper covers 0.5 square meters.

3. **Total Area to be Papered**: Since Rs. 2 covers 0.5 square meters, Rs. 260 will cover:
   \[
   \frac{260}{2} \times 0.5 = 65 \text{ square meters}
   \]

4. **Excluding Doors and Windows**: We need to exclude 15 square meters for doors and windows, so the actual area to be papered is:
   \[
   65 - 15 = 50 \text{ square meters}

5. **Calculating the Room's Dimensions**: The area to be papered is the lateral surface area of the room, which is the perimeter of the room times the height. Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \), then:

We have a sequence of \( k \) consecutive integers, starting from \(-50\). The sum of these integers is 51. We need to find the value of \( k \).

First, let's express the sequence of integers. If the first integer is \(-50\), the sequence is:
\[
-50, -49, -48, \ldots, (-50 + k - 1)
\]

The last integer in this sequence is \(-50 + k - 1\).

The sum of these \( k \) integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 + (-50 + k - 1))
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 - 50 + k - 1)
\]
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
102 = k \times (k - 101)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
102 = k^2 - 101k
\]

Rearrange the equation:
\[
k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0
\]

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102)
\]
\[
= 10201 + 408
\]
\[
= 10609
\]

The square root of 10609 is 103 (since \( 103^2 = 10609 \)).

Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = \frac{204}{2} = 102
\]
\[
k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we discard \(-1\).

Thus, the value of \( k \) is 102.

We have a quadratic equation: \( x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \).

One of its roots is given as 1.5. In the realm of quadratic equations, if you know one root, you can use it to find the other parameters of the equation. The roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) are related to the coefficients by Vieta's formulas:

1. The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a} \).
2. The product of the roots \( r_1 \times r_2 = \frac{c}{a} \).

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \).

Given one root \( r_1 = 1.5 \), we can find the other root \( r_2 \) using the product of the roots:

\[ r_1 \times r_2 = \frac{c}{a} = 22 \]

Substituting the known root:

\[ 1.5 \times r_2 = 22 \]

Solving for \( r_2 \):

\[ r_2 = \frac{22}{1.5} = \frac{220}{15} = \frac{44}{3} \]

Now, using the sum of the roots:

\[ r_1 + r_2 = -m \]

Substitute the values:

\[ 1.5 + \frac{44}{3} = -m \]

Convert 1.5 to a fraction to make it easier to add:

\[ 1.5 = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{18}{12} = \frac{36}{24} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{36}{24} + \frac{44}{3} = \frac{36}{24} + \frac{352}{24} = \frac{388}{24} = \frac{97}{6} \]

The rule of the universe here is that the pm must speak before the mp, and the mp must speak before the mla. The rest of the speakers can speak in any order.

Now, if we didn't have any rules, the number of ways to arrange 10 speakers would be 10 factorial, written as \(10!\). This is because each of the 10 positions can be filled by any of the 10 speakers, then 9 for the next, and so on.

However, we have a specific order for the pm, mp, and mla. To find out how many ways we can arrange these three speakers among themselves, we calculate the number of permutations of these 3 speakers, which is \(3!\) (3 factorial). This is because there are 3 positions, and each can be filled by any of the 3 speakers, then 2, then 1.

The number of ways to arrange these 3 speakers in the correct order (pm before mp before mla) is just 1, because there's only one way to order them correctly.

First, let's establish what we know:

1. Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.

Let's denote the original price of each article as \( P \).

When the price decreases by 15%, the new price becomes \( 0.85P \).

Now, let's set up the equation based on the information given:

- With the original price \( P \), Anna could buy \( \frac{300}{P} \) articles.
- With the new price \( 0.85P \), Anna can buy \( \frac{300}{0.85P} \) articles.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles she can buy is 5:

\[
\frac{300}{0.85P} - \frac{300}{P} = 5
\]

Let's solve this equation:

1. Find a common denominator and set up the equation:

\[
\frac{300P - 300 \times 0.85P}{0.85P \times P} = 5
\]

2. Simplify the numerator:

\[
300P - 255P = 45P

3. The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{45P}{0.85P^2} = 5
\]

4. Simplify by canceling \( P \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
\frac{45}{0.85P} = 5

5. Solve for \( P \):

\[
45 = 5 \times 0.85P

\[
45 = 4.25P

\[
P = \frac{45}{4.25}

We have a 10 kg mixture that is 30% sand and 70% clay. This means:

- Sand: \(0.3 \times 10 = 3\) kg
- Clay: \(0.7 \times 10 = 7\) kg

We want to adjust this mixture so that the amounts of sand and clay are equal. This means we want 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay in the final mixture.

To achieve this, we need to remove some of the original mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let's call the amount of mixture we remove \(x\) kg. When we remove \(x\) kg of the mixture, we are removing:

- Sand: \(0.3x\) kg
- Clay: \(0.7x\) kg

After removing \(x\) kg of the mixture, the remaining amounts are:

- Sand: \(3 - 0.3x\) kg
- Clay: \(7 - 0.7x\) kg

We then add \(x\) kg of pure sand to the remaining mixture. The new amounts become:

- Sand: \(3 - 0.3x + x = 3 + 0.7x\) kg
- Clay: \(7 - 0.7x\) kg

We want these to be equal, so we set up the equation:

\[ 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x \]

Solving for \(x\):

1. Add \(0.7x\) to both sides:
   \[ 3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7 \]
   \[ 3 + 1.4x = 7 \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[ 1.4x = 4 \]

3. Divide by 1.4:
   \[ x = \frac{4}{1.4} = \frac{40}{14} = \frac{20}{7} \]

So, the amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand is \(\frac{20}{7}\) kg.

The answer is (B) \(\frac{20}{7}\).",True,,,,,

B)62.5%
C)63.5%
D)64.5%
E)65.5%",A,"Alright, dear squirrel from another dimension, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

1. **Original Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let's say the man's original income is \( I \).
   - He spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%. So, his new income is \( I + 0.2I = 1.2I \).

3. **New Expenditure:**
   - Since he continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is \( 0.7 \times 1.2I = 0.84I \).

4. **Percentage of New Income:**
   - To find out what percentage this new expenditure is of his new income, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of new expenditure} = \left(\frac{0.84I}{1.2I}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \frac{0.84}{1.2} \times 100\% = 0.7 \times 100\% = 70\%
     \]

Oops! It seems I made a mistake in my calculations. Let's correct that:

- The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  \frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \times 100\% = \frac{0.84}{1.2} \times 100\%
  \]
- Simplifying \( \frac{0.84}{1.2} \):
  \[
  \frac{0.84}{1.2} = 0.7
  \]
- Therefore, the percentage of his new expenditure relative to his new income is 70%.

It seems I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The choices given are not about the percentage of the new income spent, but rather about the percentage increase in expenditure. Let's correct this:

- The new expenditure is \( 0.84I \).
- The original expenditure was \( 0.7I \).
- The increase in expenditure is \( 0.84I - 0.7I = 0.14I \).

Now, let's find the percentage increase in expenditure:
\[
\frac{0.14I}{0.7I} \times 100\% = \frac{0.14}{0.7} \times 100\% = 0.2 \times 100\% = 20\%

We have 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips. We want to make the greatest number of identical bouquets, meaning each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips, and we don't want any tulips left over.

To solve this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers: 28 and 98. The GCD will tell us the largest number of identical bouquets we can make without leaving any tulips behind.

Here's how we find the GCD:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 28 can be broken down into prime factors: \(28 = 2^2 \times 7\).
   - 98 can be broken down into prime factors: \(98 = 2 \times 7^2\).

2. **Common Factors**:
   - Both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 7.
   - The lowest power of these common factors is \(2^1\) and \(7^1\).

3. **Calculate the GCD**:
   - Multiply the lowest powers of the common factors: \(2^1 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

So, the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make is 14. This means each bouquet will have:

Sharon and Karen are working to earn tips to buy an ice cream cake. We know that Sharon can earn enough in 5 hours, and Karen can do it in 4 hours. We need to figure out how long it will take them if they work together.

Here's the plan:

1. **Sharon's Rate**: If Sharon can earn enough in 5 hours, her rate of earning is 1 cake per 5 hours, or \( \frac{1}{5} \) of a cake per hour.

2. **Karen's Rate**: Similarly, Karen's rate is 1 cake per 4 hours, or \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a cake per hour.

3. **Combined Rate**: When they work together, their rates add up. So, their combined rate is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20. So, convert the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{20} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}
   \]

   Adding these gives:
   \[
   \frac{4}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{9}{20}

We have two numbers, \( x \) and \( y \), with some conditions:
- \( x < 0 \): This means \( x \) is a negative number.
- \( y > 0 \): This means \( y \) is a positive number.
- \( |x^3| > |y^2| \): The absolute value of \( x \) cubed is greater than the absolute value of \( y \) squared.

Now, let's translate these conditions into something more tangible:

1. **Understanding \( |x^3| > |y^2| \):**
   - Since \( x \) is negative, \( x^3 \) is also negative, but \( |x^3| \) is positive because absolute value makes everything positive.
   - \( y^2 \) is positive because squaring a positive number keeps it positive.
   - So, \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) means the magnitude of \( x^3 \) is greater than the magnitude of \( y^2 \).

2. **Analyzing the choices:**

   - **(A) \( x > y \):** This can't be true because \( x \) is negative and \( y \) is positive. A negative number can't be greater than a positive number.

   - **(B) \( y^2 > x^2 \):** This is tricky. Since \( x \) is negative, \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we don't have enough information to compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) directly from the given condition.

   - **(C) \(-x^3 < y^2\):** Let's think about this. Since \( |x^3| > |y^2| \), it means the magnitude of \( x^3 \) is greater than \( y^2 \). But since \( x^3 \) is negative, \(-x^3\) becomes positive and larger than \( y^2 \). This choice is incorrect because it suggests the opposite.

   - **(D) \(-x < y\):** Since \( x \) is negative, \(-x\) is positive. Given that \( y \) is positive, this could be true, but we need to check if it must be true.

   - **(E) \( x < -y \):** Since \( x \) is negative and \( y \) is positive, \(-y\) is negative. This means \( x \) being less than \(-y\) is plausible because a negative number can be less than another negative number.

Given the conditions and the analysis, the choice that must be true is:

The man has 810 units of currency to spend. Trousers cost 70 units each, and shirts cost 30 units each. We need to figure out how many trousers he can buy if he wants to maximize the number of trousers.

1. **Calculate Maximum Trousers**: 
   - If he spends all his money on trousers, he can buy \( \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \) trousers. Since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum whole number of trousers he can buy is 11.

We know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this price is a 25% discount off the total cover price. Our mission is to find out the cover price per issue.

First, let's understand what a 25% saving means. If the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price (because 100% - 25% = 75%), we can set up an equation to find the total cover price for 15 issues.

Let \( x \) be the total cover price for 15 issues. According to the problem, 75% of \( x \) equals $42.00. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ 0.75x = 42 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.75:

\[ x = \frac{42}{0.75} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ x = 56 \]

So, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.00.

Now, to find the cover price per issue, we divide the total cover price by the number of issues:

\[ \text{Cover price per issue} = \frac{56}{15} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \text{Cover price per issue} = 3.7333\ldots \]

Christopher and Jonathan are flipping a coin 20 times. Each time it lands on heads, Christopher gives Jonathan $2. Each time it lands on tails, Jonathan gives Christopher $3. After all the flips, neither of them owes the other any money. This means the total amount of money exchanged is zero.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out:

1. Let \( H \) be the number of times the coin lands on heads.
2. Let \( T \) be the number of times the coin lands on tails.

We know:
- \( H + T = 20 \) (since the coin is flipped 20 times)
- The total money exchanged is zero, so the money Jonathan receives from heads equals the money Christopher receives from tails.

The equation for the money exchanged is:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. From \( H + T = 20 \), we can express \( T \) as:
   \[ T = 20 - H \]

2. Substitute \( T = 20 - H \) into the money equation:
   \[ 2H = 3(20 - H) \]

3. Simplify and solve for \( H \):

Allen travels at 54 kmph, while Bob zips along at 78 kmph. They meet twice, and by the second meeting, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. Our task is to find the distance between X and Y.

Let's break it down:

1. **First Meeting:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from opposite ends.
   - They meet somewhere in between X and Y for the first time.

2. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and then turns back towards X.
   - Bob continues to X and then turns back towards Y.
   - They meet again for the second time.

3. **Distance Covered:**
   - By the second meeting, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.

Now, let's use some math magic:

- Let the distance between X and Y be \( D \).
- The time taken for the first meeting is the same for both, so we can use the relative speed to find the meeting point.
- The relative speed when they are moving towards each other is \( 54 + 78 = 132 \) kmph.

For the first meeting:
- Time taken to meet = \( \frac{D}{132} \).

For the second meeting:
- By the time they meet again, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.
- Let \( t \) be the total time from the start until the second meeting.
- Distance traveled by Allen = \( 54t \).
- Distance traveled by Bob = \( 78t \).

Given that Bob travels 48 km more than Allen:
\[ 78t = 54t + 48 \]
\[ 24t = 48 \]
\[ t = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance each has traveled in 2 hours:
- Allen's distance = \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) km.
- Bob's distance = \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) km.

Since they meet for the second time after traveling these distances, and considering the round trip:
- Allen travels from X to Y and back towards X, covering a total of \( D + (D - x) \) where \( x \) is the distance from X to the first meeting point.
- Bob travels from Y to X and back towards Y, covering a total of \( D + (D - y) \) where \( y \) is the distance from Y to the first meeting point.

The total distance covered by both until the second meeting is equal to the sum of their individual distances:
- Allen's total distance = \( 108 \) km.
- Bob's total distance = \( 156 \) km.

Since they meet at the same point for the second time, the total distance covered by both should be equal to twice the distance between X and Y:
\[ 108 + 156 = 2D \]
\[ 264 = 2D \]
\[ D = 132 \text{ km} \]

Oops! It seems I made a mistake in my calculations. Let's correct that:

The correct calculation should be:
- Allen's total distance = \( 108 \) km.
- Bob's total distance = \( 156 \) km.

The difference in their distances is 48 km, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is actually half of the total distance covered by Allen or Bob in one direction, which is:

   - Average cost per year = Total cost / Lifespan = $180 / 4 = $45 per year

2. **Repaired Tires:**
   - Cost: $40 per tire

175,,"Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

Jerry bought a bond for $5,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%, but this interest is compounded every six months. This means that instead of getting all the interest at once at the end of the year, the interest is calculated and added to the bond twice a year.

Here's how we calculate it:

1. **Interest Rate Per Period**: Since the interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year), we divide the annual interest rate by 2. So, 12% per year becomes 6% per six months.

2. **Number of Compounding Periods**: Since the bond is for 1 year and interest is compounded every six months, there are 2 compounding periods in total.

3. **Compound Interest Formula**: The formula to calculate the amount after interest is compounded is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
   - \(P\) is the principal amount ($5,000).
   - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (decimal) (0.12).
   - \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (2).
   - \(t\) is the time the money is invested for in years (1).

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \times 1.1236
   \]
   \[
   A = 5618
   \]

4. **Interest Accrued**: The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618
   \]

So, the interest that Jerry's bond accrued at maturity is $618. The correct choice is (B) $618.",True,,,,,

The multiplication table is set up like this:

```
  M A D

-------------
  M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D
```

This is a multiplication problem where ""MAD"" is multiplied by ""BE"" to give the result ""AMID"". Let's break it down:

1. **MAD x E = RAE**: The last digit of ""MAD"" multiplied by E gives the last digit of ""RAE"". This means D * E ends with E.

2. **MAD x B = AMID - RAE**: The product of ""MAD"" and B, when added to ""RAE"", gives ""AMID"".

Now, let's consider the choices given:

A) 9 2 0 0
B) 9 2 0 9
C) 9 2 0 1
D) 9 2 0 7

- 920 * BE = AMID.

Let's test the options:

- **Option A (9 2 0 0)**: This implies ""BE"" is 00, which is not possible since ""BE"" must be a two-digit number.
- **Option B (9 2 0 9)**: Here, ""BE"" is 09. Let's check:
  - 920 * 9 = 8280, which ends with 0, not 9. So, this doesn't work.
- **Option C (9 2 0 1)**: Here, ""BE"" is 01. Let's check:
  - 920 * 1 = 920, which ends with 0, not 1. So, this doesn't work.
- **Option D (9 2 0 7)**: Here, ""BE"" is 07. Let's check:
  - 920 * 7 = 6440, which ends with 0, not 7. So, this doesn't work.
- **Option E (9 2 2 2)**: Here, ""BE"" is 22. Let's check:
  - 920 * 2 = 1840, which ends with 0, not 2. So, this doesn't work.

First, we need to figure out how old Sachin is today. We know that in 10 years, Sachin will be 40 years old. So, if we subtract 10 years from 40, we find out how old Sachin is today:

Sachin's age today = 40 - 10 = 30 years old.

Now, let's go back 10 years from today. At that time, Sachin was:

Sachin's age 10 years ago = 30 - 10 = 20 years old.

According to the problem, 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, if Sachin was 20 years old back then, Ajay must have been half of that age:

Ajay's age 10 years ago = 20 / 2 = 10 years old.

E)None of these",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

We have a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Now, we want to add a 1-meter wide boundary around this plot. This boundary is like a cosmic force field that extends 1 meter out from each side of the rectangle.

To find the area of this boundary, we need to consider the new dimensions of the plot with the boundary included. If the original length is \( L \) and the width is \( W \), the new dimensions with the boundary are:

- New Length = \( L + 2 \) (1 meter added to each side)
- New Width = \( W + 2 \) (1 meter added to each side)

The area of the boundary is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original rectangle:

\[ \text{Area of boundary} = (L + 2) \times (W + 2) - L \times W \]

But first, we need to find the original dimensions. We know:

\[ 2 \times (L + W) = 340 \]

\[ L + W = 170 \]

Now, the area of the boundary can be simplified as:

\[ \text{Area of boundary} = (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW \]

Expanding the first term:

\[ = LW + 2L + 2W + 4 - LW \]

\[ = 2L + 2W + 4 \]

Since \( L + W = 170 \), we substitute:

\[ = 2 \times 170 + 4 \]

\[ = 340 + 4 \]

\[ = 344 \]

Imagine Ace Book Company's total sales revenue as a big, juicy acorn. Now, 34% of this acorn is made up of novels. So, if we think of the whole acorn as 100%, then the novels take up 34% of it.

This means the remaining part of the acorn, which is not novels, is 100% - 34% = 66%. This 66% is the part of the acorn that includes biographies and other things.

Now, from this remaining 66% of the acorn, 1/3 is from biographies. So, we need to find out how much of the whole acorn (the total revenue) is from biographies.

1/3 of 66% is calculated as:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66\% = 22\%

So, 22% of the total acorn (revenue) is from biographies.

Now, we want to know how many times the revenue from novels (34% of the acorn) is compared to the revenue from biographies (22% of the acorn).

The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters. This means that for every 100 flowers it flies by, it skips 0.05 of them. But since flowers can't be in fractions, let's think bigger.

To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we need to set up a simple equation. If 0.05% of the flowers are bypassed, then:

\[ \text{Bypassed Flowers} = 0.05\% \times \text{Total Flowers} \]

We want the bee to bypass 8 flowers, so:

\[ 8 = 0.05\% \times \text{Total Flowers} \]

Convert 0.05% to a decimal for easier calculation:

\[ 0.05\% = \frac{0.05}{100} = 0.0005 \]

Now, plug this into the equation:

\[ 8 = 0.0005 \times \text{Total Flowers} \]

To find the total number of flowers, divide both sides by 0.0005:

\[ \text{Total Flowers} = \frac{8}{0.0005} \]

Fernando has a meal plan that allows him to have 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so he can only have meals from Monday to Friday. Additionally, he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, which means he can't use his meal plan for dinner on Fridays.

Let's first consider the lunches. Fernando has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to choose from for his 3 lunches. The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 for his lunches is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{3} \).

Now, let's consider the dinners. Since Fernando goes home for dinner on Friday, he only has Monday to Thursday available for his 3 dinners. The number of ways to choose 3 days out of these 4 for his dinners is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Therefore, the total number of ways Fernando can allocate his meals is the product of the number of ways to choose the lunches and the number of ways to choose the dinners:

\[
\binom{5}{3} \times \binom{4}{3}

1. **Recognize the Identity**: The expression \(a^2 - b^2\) is a well-known algebraic identity that can be factored as \((a - b)(a + b)\).

2. **Substitute the Identity**: Replace \(a^2 - b^2\) with \((a - b)(a + b)\) in the equation:

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b}

First, let's figure out how much of the wall each can build in one minute:

- A builds \(\frac{1}{40}\) of the wall per minute.

When they work together, their combined wall-building power per minute is:

\[

First, we need to figure out how long the train is. We know it takes 3 seconds for the train to fully enter the tunnel. During this time, the entire length of the train is moving into the tunnel.

The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour. To find out how far it travels in 3 seconds, we need to convert the speed into miles per second. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Speed in miles per second} = \frac{120 \text{ miles per hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second} \]

In 3 seconds, the train travels:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second} \times 3 \text{ seconds} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles} \]

So, the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a mile long.

The merchant has an invoice for a motorboat priced at $20,000. The terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that if the merchant pays within 30 days, he gets a 4% discount. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

First, let's calculate the discount:
- 4% of $20,000 is $800.

So, if the merchant pays within 30 days, he only needs to pay $20,000 - $800 = $19,200.

Now, the merchant wants to borrow money to take advantage of this discount. He needs to figure out the highest simple interest rate he can afford to pay on the borrowed money, such that the cost of borrowing doesn't exceed the discount benefit.

The merchant has 70 more days (100 - 30) to pay the full amount if he doesn't take the discount. So, he needs to calculate the interest for 70 days.

Let's denote the principal amount (the amount he borrows) as $19,200, the interest rate as \( r \), and the time period as 70 days (which is \(\frac{70}{365}\) years, since interest rates are typically annual).

The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

The interest should not exceed the discount of $800. So:
\[ 19,200 \times r \times \frac{70}{365} \leq 800 \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ r \leq \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70} \]

Imagine you have 10 unique acorns (bottles) and you want to split them into two piles of 5. The key here is that the order of the groups doesn't matter. If you have one group with acorns A, B, C, D, E and the other with F, G, H, I, J, it's the same as having the first group with F, G, H, I, J and the second with A, B, C, D, E.

To find the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10, we use the combination formula:

A)6.5
B)7.5
C)7
D)6
E)None of the above",B,"Alright, dear squirrel from another dimension, let's unravel this cereal conundrum together!

We have a special cereal mixture with rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. This means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

Now, we're told that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find out how many total parts there are in the mixture.

Let's denote the common factor for the parts as \( x \). So, the amount of rice is \( 2x \), and we know this equals 3 pounds:

\[ 2x = 3 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for it:

\[ x = \frac{3}{2} \]

Now, let's find out how much corn there is. The corn is represented by 5 parts in the ratio. So, the amount of corn is:

\[ 5x = 5 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn. So, the answer is:

A)500
B)600
C)750
D)800
E)900",E,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. One soda (let's call it \( S \)) and two energy bars (let's call them \( B \)) cost 150 cents:
   \[
   S + 2B = 150
   \]

2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents:
   \[
   2S + 3B = 300
   \]

Our mission is to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is \( 6S + 7B \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the individual costs of \( S \) and \( B \).

From the first equation, express \( S \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
S = 150 - 2B
\]

Substitute this expression for \( S \) into the second equation:
\[
2(150 - 2B) + 3B = 300
\]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):
\[
300 - 4B + 3B = 300
\]
\[
300 - B = 300
\]
\[
-B = 0
\]
\[
B = 0
\]

Now that we know \( B = 0 \), substitute back to find \( S \):
\[
S + 2(0) = 150
\]
\[
S = 150
\]

So, a soda costs 150 cents, and an energy bar costs 0 cents. Now, calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:
\[
6S + 7B = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900
\]

Therefore, the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars is \(\boxed{900}\).

A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler, and each pen is sold for Rs. 10. So, the total revenue from selling these pens is:

\[ 7200 \text{ pens} \times 10 \text{ Rs/pen} = 72000 \text{ Rs} \]

Now, the company wants to make a 25% profit on all the pens it manufactures. Let's denote the total manufacturing cost of all pens as \( C \).

The profit is 25% of the manufacturing cost, so the total revenue should be:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 0.25C = 1.25C \]

We know the total revenue is Rs. 72000, so:

\[ 1.25C = 72000 \]

To find the total manufacturing cost \( C \), we solve for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{72000}{1.25} = 57600 \text{ Rs} \]

Now, remember that 10% of the pens are defective and rejected before packing. This means the company has to manufacture more pens than the 7200 they deliver. Let's denote the total number of pens manufactured as \( N \).

Since 10% are defective, 90% of the manufactured pens are good. Therefore:

\[ 0.9N = 7200 \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \]

So, the company manufactures 8000 pens in total. The total manufacturing cost is Rs. 57600 for these 8000 pens.

To find the manufacturing cost per pen, we divide the total manufacturing cost by the total number of pens manufactured:

\[ \text{Cost per pen} = \frac{57600}{8000} = 7.2 \text{ Rs/pen} \]

So, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. Therefore, the correct choice is:

\[ \boxed{B) \text{Rs. 7.2}} \]",True,,,,,

A)12
B)24
C)42
D)48
E)49",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum together!

We're dealing with a two-digit number. Let's call the digit in the ten's place \( x \) and the digit in the unit's place \( y \). Therefore, the number itself can be expressed as \( 10x + y \).

Now, according to the problem, this number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Mathematically, this can be written as:

\[ 10x + y = (x + y) + 18 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ 10x + y = x + y + 18 \]

Subtract \( x + y \) from both sides:

\[ 9x = 18 \]

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

\[ x = 2 \]

Now, the problem also tells us that the digit at the unit's place \( y \) is double the digit in the ten's place \( x \). So:

\[ y = 2x \]

Substituting \( x = 2 \) into this equation gives:

\[ y = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the number is \( 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24 \).

Therefore, the number is 24, which corresponds to choice (B).

B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)
D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)
E)None",D,"To solve this problem, let's first understand the functions involved:

1. **Greatest Integer Function**: For any real number \( x \), \([x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \)
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \)

We need to determine which of the given statements is impossible for any two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

### Analyzing \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \):

- **\( L(x, y) \)**:
  - \([x]\) is the integer part of \( x \).
  - \([y]\) is the integer part of \( y \).
  - \([x + y]\) is the integer part of the sum \( x + y \).

- **\( R(x, y) \)**:
  - \([2x]\) is the integer part of \( 2x \).
  - \([2y]\) is the integer part of \( 2y \).

### Exploring the Relationship:

1. **Equality \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \)**:
   - For \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \), we need:
     \[
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     \]

2. **Inequality \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \)**:
   - This would mean:
     \[
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] \neq [2x] + [2y]
     \]

3. **Inequality \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \)**:
   - This would mean:
     \[
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y]
     \]

4. **Inequality \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \)**:
   - This would mean:
     \[
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] > [2x] + [2y]
     \]

### Key Observations:

- **\( [x + y] \) vs. \( [2x] + [2y] \)**:
  - The sum \( [x] + [y] \) is straightforward, but \( [x + y] \) can be tricky because it depends on the fractional parts of \( x \) and \( y \).
  - If \( x = a + \epsilon \) and \( y = b + \delta \) where \( a, b \) are integers and \( 0 \leq \epsilon, \delta < 1 \), then:
    \[
    [x + y] = [a + b + \epsilon + \delta]
    \]
  - If \( \epsilon + \delta < 1 \), then \([x + y] = a + b\).
  - If \( \epsilon + \delta \geq 1 \), then \([x + y] = a + b + 1\).

- **\( [2x] + [2y] \)**:
  - \([2x] = [2a + 2\epsilon]\) and \([2y] = [2b + 2\delta]\).
  - If \( 2\epsilon < 1 \), then \([2x] = 2a\).
  - If \( 2\epsilon \geq 1 \), then \([2x] = 2a + 1\).
  - Similarly for \([2y]\).

### Conclusion:

- **\( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \)** is possible.
- **\( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \)** is possible.
- **\( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \)** is possible.
- **\( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \)** is also possible.

However, the problem asks for the impossible scenario. Given the nature of the greatest integer function and the way it handles fractional parts, it is impossible for:

- **\( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \)** to always hold true for all positive \( x \) and \( y \).

Thus, the answer is:

**(C) L(x, y) < R(x, y)** is impossible for all positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).",False,,,,,

They all start ringing at the same time, and we need to find out when they will all ring together again.

To solve this, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the three time intervals. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of these intervals, which will tell us when all the bells will ring together again.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 36 = 2² × 3²
   - 40 = 2³ × 5
   - 48 = 2⁴ × 3

2. **Find the LCM**:
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:
     - The highest power of 2 is 2⁴.
     - The highest power of 3 is 3².
     - The highest power of 5 is 5.

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - LCM = 2⁴ × 3² × 5
   - LCM = 16 × 9 × 5
   - LCM = 144 × 5
   - LCM = 720 seconds

Now, 720 seconds is the time after which all three bells will ring together again. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

720 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 12 minutes

So, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes. Therefore, the answer is:

We have an electric pole that's 14 meters tall, and it casts a shadow that's 10 meters long. Now, imagine this as a simple ratio of height to shadow length. The ratio for the pole is:

\[ \text{Height of pole} : \text{Shadow of pole} = 14 : 10 \]

This ratio can be simplified to:

\[ \frac{14}{10} = \frac{7}{5} \]

Now, we have a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters. We need to find the height of this tree, let's call it \( h \).

Since the conditions are similar (meaning the angle of the sun is the same), the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow will be the same as the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow. So, we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{h}{15} = \frac{7}{5} \]

To find \( h \), we cross-multiply:

\[ 5h = 7 \times 15 \]

\[ 5h = 105 \]

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{105}{5} \]

\[ h = 21 \]

We have a triangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \((a, 0)\), \((b, 0)\), and \((x, y)\). The coordinates \((a, 0)\) and \((b, 0)\) lie on the x-axis, while \((x, y)\) is somewhere in the plane, with \(y\) being negative (since \(0 > y\)).

The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|

Plugging in our vertices \((a, 0)\), \((b, 0)\), and \((x, y)\), we have:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| a(0-y) + b(y-0) + x(0-0) \right|

B)50 kmph
C)120 kmph
D)70 kmph
E)80 kmph",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

First, we need to figure out how far the car travels in the first scenario. The car is moving at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{km/hr} \times 20 \, \text{hr} = 1200 \, \text{km} \]

So, the car travels 1200 kilometers.

Now, in the second scenario, the car needs to cover the same 1200 kilometers, but in only 10 hours. To find the new speed required, we use the formula:

\[ \text{New Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \, \text{km}}{10 \, \text{hr}} = 120 \, \text{km/hr} \]

The car's original speed was 60 km/hr, and now it needs to travel at 120 km/hr. To find out how much speed the car gains, we subtract the original speed from the new speed:

\[ \text{Speed Gain} = 120 \, \text{km/hr} - 60 \, \text{km/hr} = 60 \, \text{km/hr} \]

However, it seems there might be a little cosmic confusion in the choices provided. None of them directly match our calculated speed gain of 60 km/hr. But if we look at the new speed required, which is 120 km/hr, it matches one of the choices.

We have three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter, each with different methods of answering a question.

1. **Alan** guesses randomly, so he has a 1/5 chance of getting it right.
2. **Roger** cheats, giving him a 2/3 chance of getting it right.
3. **Peter** does the calculations, giving him a 5/6 chance of getting it right.

We want to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

Let's calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter:

- **Probability that Alan answers correctly**: \( P(A) = \frac{1}{5} \)
- **Probability that Peter answers correctly**: \( P(P) = \frac{5}{6} \)

Since Alan and Peter are independent of each other, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly (but not Roger) is:

\[ P(\text{Correct but not cheating}) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \text{ and } P) \]

However, since Alan and Peter are independent, the probability that both answer correctly is:

\[ P(A \text{ and } P) = P(A) \times P(P) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Thus, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is:

\[ P(\text{Correct but not cheating}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{5}{6}\):

   \(\frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{30}\)

2. Convert \(\frac{5}{6}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{1}{5}\):

   \(\frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{30}\)

3. Now, calculate:

   \(\frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} - \frac{5}{30} = \frac{26}{30}\)

4. Simplify \(\frac{26}{30}\):

   \(\frac{26}{30} = \frac{13}{15}\)

However, we need to exclude the case where Roger cheats and gets it right. Since Roger's cheating is independent of Alan and Peter, we need to subtract the probability that Roger answers correctly:

- **Probability that Roger answers correctly**: \( P(R) = \frac{2}{3} \)

The probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger, is:

\[ P(\text{Correct but not cheating}) = \frac{13}{15} - \frac{2}{3} \]

Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{13}{15}\):

- \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{10}{15}\)

Now, calculate:

\[ \frac{13}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \]

But this doesn't match any of the options. Let's re-evaluate:

The correct approach is to consider only the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, and Roger does not:

\[ P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter, not Roger}) = P(A) \times (1 - P(R)) + P(P) \times (1 - P(R)) \]

Calculate:

1. \( P(A) \times (1 - P(R)) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \)
2. \( P(P) \times (1 - P(R)) = \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \)

Add these probabilities:

\[ \frac{1}{15} + \frac{5}{18} \]

Convert \(\frac{1}{15}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{5}{18}\):

- \(\frac{1}{15} = \frac{6}{90}\)
- \(\frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{90}\)

Add them:

\[ \frac{6}{90} + \frac{25}{90} = \frac{31}{90} \]

A)10%
B)12%
C)6%
D)8%
E)4%",B,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn collector could understand.

We have two types of interest here: Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI). The problem tells us that the difference between these two for a principal amount of Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72. We need to find the rate of interest.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Simple Interest (SI)** is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
   where \( P \) is the principal amount, \( R \) is the rate of interest, and \( T \) is the time in years.

2. **Compound Interest (CI)** for 2 years is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P
   \]
   For 2 years, this becomes:
   \[
   \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P
   \]

3. The difference between CI and SI for 2 years is given by:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{CI} - \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R^2}{100^2}
   \]
   This is because the difference for 2 years is primarily due to the interest on the interest from the first year.

Given:
- Principal \( P = 5000 \)
- Time \( T = 2 \) years
- Difference = Rs. 72

Plug these into the difference formula:
\[
\frac{5000 \times R^2}{100^2} = 72
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{5000 \times R^2}{10000} = 72
\]

\[
500 \times R^2 = 7200
\]

\[
R^2 = \frac{7200}{500}
\]

\[
R^2 = 14.4

\[
R = \sqrt{14.4}

201,,"All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"Alright, dear squirrel from another dimension, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum together!

We have a total of 250 files, and they are all infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. Let's use some interdimensional logic to break this down:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( V \) be the number of files infected by a virus.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of files infected by a worm.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

2. **Given Information:**
   - 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means 50% were infected by a virus. So, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
   - The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, if \( B \) is the number of files infected by both, then the number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5B \).

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The files infected only by a virus are \( V - B \).
   - The files infected only by a worm are \( 2.5B \).
   - The files infected by both are \( B \).

4. **Total Files Equation:**
   \[
   (V - B) + (2.5B) + B = 250
   \]

5. **Substitute \( V = 125 \):**
   \[
   (125 - B) + 2.5B + B = 250
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   125 - B + 3.5B = 250
   \]
   \[
   125 + 2.5B = 250
   \]
   \[
   2.5B = 125
   \]
   \[
   B = 50
   \]

7. **Calculate Files Infected Only by a Worm:**
   - Files infected only by a worm = \( 2.5B = 2.5 \times 50 = 125 \).

8. **Calculate Files Infected Only by a Virus:**
   - Files infected only by a virus = \( V - B = 125 - 50 = 75 \).

9. **Files Not Infected by a Worm:**
   - These are the files infected only by a virus, which is 75.

Thus, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is \(\boxed{75}\).

So, the answer is (C) 75.",True,,,,,
202,,"A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share.
A)2400
B)2500
C)2600
D)2700
E)None of these",B,"Alright, let's break this down for our interdimensional squirrel friend.

The father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, such that when they both turn 26, the amount they have will be equal if invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum.

Here's the plan:

1. **Understand the Time Frame:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he has 3 years until he turns 26.
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he has 2 years until he turns 26.

2. **Compound Interest Formula:**
   - The formula for compound interest is \( A = P(1 + r)^n \), where:
     - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
     - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
     - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
     - \( n \) is the number of years the money is invested.

3. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let Mohan's share be \( M \) and Sohan's share be \( S \).
   - We know \( M + S = 5100 \).

   - For Mohan, the amount after 3 years will be:
     \[
     M(1 + 0.04)^3 = M(1.04)^3
     \]

   - For Sohan, the amount after 2 years will be:
     \[
     S(1 + 0.04)^2 = S(1.04)^2
     \]

4. **Equal Amounts at Age 26:**
   - We want these amounts to be equal:
     \[
     M(1.04)^3 = S(1.04)^2
     \]

5. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     M(1.04)^3 = S(1.04)^2
     \]
     \[
     M \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816
     \]
     \[
     M = \frac{S \times 1.0816}{1.124864}
     \]

   - Substitute \( M = 5100 - S \) into the equation:
     \[
     5100 - S = \frac{S \times 1.0816}{1.124864}
     \]

   - Solve for \( S \):
     \[
     5100 \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816 + S \times 1.124864
     \]
     \[
     5737.6064 = S \times (1.0816 + 1.124864)
     \]
     \[
     5737.6064 = S \times 2.206464
     \]
     \[
     S = \frac{5737.6064}{2.206464} \approx 2600
     \]

   - Therefore, Mohan's share \( M = 5100 - 2600 = 2500 \).

So, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500. The answer is (B) 2500.",True,,,,,
203,,"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?
A)450 gms
B)100 gms
C)252 gms
D)240 gms
E)None of these",C,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something as simple as finding a nut in a tree.

We need to find 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. Think of it as a two-step journey through the forest of percentages.

1. **First Step: 30% of 1400 grams**

   To find 30% of 1400 grams, you multiply 1400 by 0.30 (since 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form).

   \[
   1400 \times 0.30 = 420 \text{ grams}
   \]

   So, 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.

2. **Second Step: 60% of 420 grams**

   Now, we need to find 60% of the 420 grams we just calculated. Again, convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.60.

   \[
   420 \times 0.60 = 252 \text{ grams}
   \]

   So, 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 252 grams, which corresponds to choice (C).

So, the correct intergalactic rune to select is (C) 252 gms.",True,,,,,

D)w/(3xy)
E)3y/(wx)",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

We have a liquid flowing through a drain at a rate of \( \frac{w}{25} \) gallons every \( x \) seconds. Our task is to find out how many minutes it will take for \( y \) gallons to pass through the drain.

First, let's figure out the rate of flow in terms of gallons per second. Since the liquid flows at \( \frac{w}{25} \) gallons every \( x \) seconds, the rate in gallons per second is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{w}{25x} \text{ gallons per second}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many seconds it takes for \( y \) gallons to pass through. Using the rate we just calculated, the time \( t \) in seconds to pass \( y \) gallons is:

\[
t = \frac{y}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{y}{\frac{w}{25x}} = \frac{y \times 25x}{w} = \frac{25xy}{w} \text{ seconds}
\]

But wait! The problem asks for the time in minutes, not seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{25xy}{w} \div 60 = \frac{25xy}{60w} = \frac{5xy}{12w}
\]

So, the answer to how many minutes it will take for \( y \) gallons to pass through the drain is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{5xy}{12w}}
\]

This corresponds to choice (C). So, the intergalactic rune you seek is (C).",True,,,,,

\[ r = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \text{ mm} \]

The thickness \( h \) is 2 mm. So, the volume \( V \) of the coin is:

\[ V = \pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2 \]

\[ V = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 \]

\[ V = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm} \]

Now, since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, each occupies half of the total volume:

\[ V_{\text{aluminum}} = V_{\text{silver}} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \text{ cubic mm} \]

Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, let's denote the density of aluminum as \( \rho \) and the density of silver as \( 2\rho \).

The weight of the aluminum part is:

\[ \text{Weight of aluminum} = \rho \times 56.25\pi \]

The weight of the silver part is:

\[ \text{Weight of silver} = 2\rho \times 56.25\pi \]

The total weight of the coin is 30 grams:

\[ \rho \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]

\[ 3\rho \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]

\[ \rho \times 56.25\pi = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the weight of a new coin made entirely of aluminum, with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 30 mm.

The radius of the new coin is:

\[ r = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ mm} \]

The thickness \( h \) is 1 mm. So, the volume \( V \) of the new coin is:

\[ V = \pi \times (15)^2 \times 1 \]

\[ V = \pi \times 225 \]

\[ V = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm} \]

The weight of this new coin made of pure aluminum is:

\[ \text{Weight} = \rho \times 225\pi \]

We know from earlier that:

\[ \rho \times 56.25\pi = 10 \]

So:

\[ \rho = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \]

Substitute this into the weight of the new coin:

\[ \text{Weight} = \left(\frac{10}{56.25\pi}\right) \times 225\pi \]

\[ \text{Weight} = \frac{10 \times 225\pi}{56.25\pi} \]

\[ \text{Weight} = \frac{2250}{56.25} \]

\[ \text{Weight} = 40 \text{ grams} \]

So, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams. Therefore, the answer is:

**B) 40 grams**",True,,,,,

E)220",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic nut-gatherer can understand.

We have a mysterious number, let's call it \( x \). The problem tells us that if we take \(\frac{2}{3}\) of this number and subtract 10, we get the same result as if we add 40 to \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number.

Let's write this down in a way that makes sense across dimensions:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. **Get all the \( x \) terms on one side**: 

   Subtract \(\frac{1}{3}x\) from both sides:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3}x - 10 = 40
   \]

2. **Isolate the \( x \) term**:

   Add 10 to both sides to get rid of the pesky -10:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3}x = 50
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:

   Multiply both sides by 3 to free \( x \) from the fraction:

E)12",C,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum together. We're dealing with a quadratic equation of the form \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\). To determine when this equation has two real and distinct roots, we need to focus on the discriminant, which is a magical number in the quadratic formula world.

The discriminant \(\Delta\) for a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by the formula:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

In our equation, \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plug these values into the discriminant formula:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times k = 25 - 4k
\]

For the roots to be real and distinct, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Now, let's solve this inequality for \(k\):

\[
25 > 4k
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to isolate \(k\):

\[
k < \frac{25}{4}

Calculating \(\frac{25}{4}\) gives us 6.25. Since \(k\) must be an integer, the largest possible integer value for \(k\) that satisfies this inequality is 6.

Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour. This means for every 1 hour, she covers 10 km. However, she has a habit of taking a 10-minute rest after every 15 km.

First, let's figure out how long it takes her to ride 15 km:
- At 10 km per hour, it takes her 1.5 hours to ride 15 km (since 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours).

After riding 15 km, she takes a 10-minute rest. Since 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour (because 10 minutes / 60 minutes = 1/6), we add this to her riding time:
- Total time for 15 km = 1.5 hours + 1/6 hour = 1.5 + 0.1667 ≈ 1.6667 hours.

Now, let's see how many 15 km segments fit into 100 km:
- 100 km / 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder of 10 km.

For the 6 full segments:
- Total time for 6 segments = 6 * 1.6667 hours ≈ 10 hours.

Now, she has 10 km left to cover after the 6 segments:
- Time to ride the remaining 10 km = 10 km / 10 km per hour = 1 hour.

Adding it all up:
- Total time = 10 hours (for the 6 segments) + 1 hour (for the remaining 10 km) = 11 hours.

C)16 hrs
D)20 hrs
E)13 hrs",E,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

We have two modes of travel: train and car. Mr. Sam's journey involves a round trip to a city, and we know the following:

1. **Train to city and car back**: This takes 17 hours.
2. **Train both ways**: This takes 4 hours longer than the first scenario, so it takes 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

Let's use some simple algebra to figure out the time it takes for each mode of travel:

- Let \( T \) be the time it takes to travel one way by train.
- Let \( C \) be the time it takes to travel one way by car.

From the information given:
- Train to city and car back: \( T + C = 17 \)
- Train both ways: \( 2T = 21 \)

From the second equation, we can solve for \( T \):
\[ 2T = 21 \]
\[ T = 10.5 \]

Now that we know \( T = 10.5 \), we can substitute this into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ T + C = 17 \]
\[ 10.5 + C = 17 \]
\[ C = 17 - 10.5 \]
\[ C = 6.5 \]

So, it takes 6.5 hours to travel one way by car. If Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car, the total time would be:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 6.5 = 13 \]

Jim's dog starts eating at 8:00 am, and every hour, it eats 1/3 of the food that's left in the bowl. We need to figure out how much food is left right before the dog starts eating at noon.

Here's how it goes:

1. **8:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
2. **9:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of what's left, which is 1/3 of 2/3. So, it eats (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original amount, leaving 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9 of the original amount.
3. **10:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of what's left, which is 1/3 of 4/9. So, it eats (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original amount, leaving 4/9 - 4/27 = 8/27 of the original amount.
4. **11:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of what's left, which is 1/3 of 8/27. So, it eats (1/3) * (8/27) = 8/81 of the original amount, leaving 8/27 - 8/81 = 16/81 of the original amount.

Now, we need to convert this fraction into a percentage to find out how much of the original food is left right before noon.

To convert 16/81 into a percentage, we do the following calculation:

\[
\frac{16}{81} \approx 0.1975

Multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

   - We are told that 10 men prefer green cars. So, these 10 men represent 25% of the total number of men surveyed.

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Men:**
   - If 10 men are 25% of the men surveyed, then to find the total number of men, we can set up the equation:

He can either take a single step or a double step, like hopping through wormholes of different lengths.

To solve this, we need to think about how many ways he can reach each step, starting from the ground (step 0) to the top (step 10). This is a classic problem that can be solved using the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Here's how it works:

1. **Step 0**: There's only 1 way to be on the ground (do nothing).
2. **Step 1**: He can take a single step from the ground, so there's 1 way.
3. **Step 2**: He can reach here by taking two single steps (1+1) or one double step (2), so there are 2 ways.

For each subsequent step, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the ways to reach the two previous steps:

- **Step 3**: Ways to reach = Ways to reach Step 2 + Ways to reach Step 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- **Step 4**: Ways to reach = Ways to reach Step 3 + Ways to reach Step 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
- **Step 5**: Ways to reach = Ways to reach Step 4 + Ways to reach Step 3 = 5 + 3 = 8
- **Step 6**: Ways to reach = Ways to reach Step 5 + Ways to reach Step 4 = 8 + 5 = 13
- **Step 7**: Ways to reach = Ways to reach Step 6 + Ways to reach Step 5 = 13 + 8 = 21

We start with 1 gallon of a soft drink. This drink is made up of 40% orange juice and 60% water. So, in this 1 gallon, we have:

- 0.4 gallons of orange juice
- 0.6 gallons of water

Now, we want to add more orange juice so that the orange juice becomes 60% of the total mixture. Let's call the additional gallons of orange juice we need to add ""x"".

After adding ""x"" gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice will be \(0.4 + x\) gallons. The total volume of the mixture will be \(1 + x\) gallons (since we're adding ""x"" gallons to the original 1 gallon).

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
\]

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Multiply both sides by \(1 + x\) to get rid of the fraction:

\[
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
\]

2. Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:

\[
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x

\[
x - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4

We have a worker who toils for 15 days, and his average wage over these days is $90 per day. This means if we multiply the average wage by the number of days, we get the total wages for all 15 days:

\[ 15 \times 90 = 1350 \]

This is the total amount of cosmic credits he earned over the 15 days.

Now, let's look at the first 7 days. During this time, his average wage was $87 per day. So, the total wages for these 7 days are:

\[ 7 \times 87 = 609 \]

For the last 7 days, his average wage was $92 per day. So, the total wages for these last 7 days are:

\[ 7 \times 92 = 644 \]

Now, we need to find out how much he earned on the 8th day. We know the total wages for all 15 days is $1350. If we subtract the wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from this total, we'll find the wage for the 8th day:

We have two numbers, let's call them \(3x\) and \(5x\), because they are in the ratio of 3:5. This means for every 3 parts of the first number, there are 5 parts of the second number.

Now, if we subtract 9 from each of these numbers, the new numbers become \(3x - 9\) and \(5x - 9\). These new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

So, we can set up the equation based on this new ratio:

\[
\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \frac{12}{23}

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

1. **Understanding the Ages:**
   - Denis is 5 years old.
   - Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Rahul is \(5 - 2 = 3\) years old.

2. **Equation for Ajay's Age:**
   - We know that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the result is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age.

Imagine the original price of the tyre is like a big, shiny acorn worth 100 units of your squirrel currency. The manufacturer decides to give a 20% discount, which means you get to keep 20% of that acorn. So, you save 20 units, and the price drops to 80 units.

Now, the retailer, being generous, offers an additional 20% discount on this new price. But here's the trick: this 20% is not on the original 100 units, but on the already discounted 80 units. So, 20% of 80 units is 16 units.

Imagine a rectangular parking space. This rectangle has four sides, but only three of them are painted. The side that isn't painted is 9 feet long. Let's call this side the ""width"" of the rectangle, \( w = 9 \) feet.

Now, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since three sides are painted, this includes two lengths and one width. Let's call the length of the rectangle \( l \).

So, the painted sides are:
1. One width, which is 9 feet.

First, let's calculate the total weight increase for all 10 oarsmen. Since the average weight increases by 1.8 kg, the total increase in weight for all 10 oarsmen is:

\[ 1.8 \, \text{kg} \times 10 = 18 \, \text{kg} \]

This means that the new oarsman is 18 kg heavier than the oarsman he replaced. The oarsman who was replaced weighed 53 kg. So, the weight of the new oarsman is:

We have a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We want to select 2 balls, but we have a special rule: the ball numbered 3 cannot be one of them. And we know there are 45 different ways to do this.

First, let's think about how many ways we can choose 2 balls from n balls in total. This is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

But remember, we can't pick the ball numbered 3. So, we effectively have \(n-1\) balls to choose from (since we're excluding ball number 3).

Now, we need to find how many ways we can choose 2 balls from these \(n-1\) balls:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

According to the problem, this number of ways is 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

Let's solve this equation. First, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90

Now, expand the left side:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90

Subtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula, where \(a = 1\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -88\):

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

\[
n = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-88)}}{2 \cdot 1}

First, let's understand how the number of factors of a positive integer is determined. If a number \( Q \) can be expressed in terms of its prime factorization as \( Q = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), then the total number of factors of \( Q \) is given by:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1)
\]

For \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors, the product of these terms must equal 5. Now, 5 is a prime number, which means it can only be expressed as a product of integers in one way: \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \).

This implies that one of the exponents \( a_i \) must be 4 (since \( 4 + 1 = 5 \)), and all other exponents must be 0. Therefore, \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

Now, let's evaluate the given statements:

I. **Q is the square of a prime number.**
   - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), not 5. So, this statement is false.

II. **Q is the fourth power of a prime number.**
   - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This statement is true.

III. **Q is the product of two prime numbers.**
   - If \( Q = p \times q \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes, then the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), not 5. So, this statement is false.

Thus, the only statement that must be true is II. Therefore, the correct choice is:

We have a bag with 11 candy bars, and they come in three different price categories:
- 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each.
- 4 candy bars cost $1 each.
- 4 candy bars cost $2 each.

Our mission is to select 3 candy bars such that their total cost is more than $4. Let's explore the possibilities:

1. **All three candy bars cost $2 each:**
   - If we pick 3 candy bars, each costing $2, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars, which is more than $4.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 candy bars from the 4 that cost $2 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).

2. **Two candy bars cost $2 each, and one costs $1:**
   - The total cost is \(2 \times 2 + 1 = 5\) dollars, which is more than $4.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 candy bars from the 4 that cost $2 is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).
   - The number of ways to choose 1 candy bar from the 4 that cost $1 is \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\).
   - Therefore, the total number of ways for this scenario is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

3. **Two candy bars cost $2 each, and one costs 50 cents:**
   - The total cost is \(2 \times 2 + 0.5 = 4.5\) dollars, which is more than $4.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 candy bars from the 4 that cost $2 is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).
   - The number of ways to choose 1 candy bar from the 3 that cost 50 cents is \(\binom{3}{1} = 3\).
   - Therefore, the total number of ways for this scenario is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

Now, let's add up all the possible ways to achieve a total cost of more than $4:
- From scenario 1: 4 ways
- From scenario 2: 24 ways
- From scenario 3: 18 ways

Adding these up gives us \(4 + 24 + 18 = 46\) ways.

We have a team of 4 men and 4 women, making a total of 8 people. We need to choose 4 presenters, but we can't have all men or all women. So, we need to consider the mixed-gender combinations.

Let's explore the possible combinations:

1. **3 men and 1 woman:**
   - Choose 3 men from 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   - Choose 1 woman from 4: \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\)
   - Total for this case: \(4 \times 4 = 16\)

2. **2 men and 2 women:**
   - Choose 2 men from 4: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Choose 2 women from 4: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
   - Total for this case: \(6 \times 6 = 36\)

3. **1 man and 3 women:**
   - Choose 1 man from 4: \(\binom{4}{1} = 4\)
   - Choose 3 women from 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   - Total for this case: \(4 \times 4 = 16\)

Now, let's add up all these possibilities to find the total number of different groups of presenters:

\[ 16 + 36 + 16 = 68 \]

So, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen, ensuring that the group is not composed entirely of men or women, is 68.

However, it seems there is a discrepancy with the provided choices. Let's double-check the calculations:

- Total ways to choose any 4 people from 8: \(\binom{8}{4} = 70\)
- Subtract the all-men group: \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\)
- Subtract the all-women group: \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\)

Thus, the correct calculation should be:

\[ 70 - 1 - 1 = 68 \]

It seems the choices provided do not include 68, which suggests a possible error in the options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 68. If we must choose from the given options, none of them match the correct calculation. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the choices.",False,,,,,

E)70",C,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this puzzle together!

We know that 2/5 of the children in the class are girls. This means that the remaining portion, 3/5, must be boys. 

Now, we're told there are 100 boys in the class. Since these boys make up 3/5 of the class, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of children in the class:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times \text{Total number of children} = 100
\]

To find the total number of children, let's solve for it:

\[
\text{Total number of children} = \frac{100 \times 5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67
\]

Oops! That doesn't make sense because the number of children must be a whole number. Let's try another approach.

Since 3/5 of the class are boys, and there are 100 boys, the total number of children in the class is:

\[
\text{Total number of children} = \frac{100}{3/5} = 100 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} = 166.67
\]

This still doesn't work, so let's try a different method. Let's assume the total number of children is \( x \).

\[
\frac{3}{5}x = 100
\]

\[
x = \frac{100 \times 5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} = 166.67

239,,"Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000?
A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000\} \) is relatively prime to 1000. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3. \]

The numbers that are not relatively prime to 1000 are those that share at least one of these prime factors (2 or 5). To find the count of numbers that are relatively prime to 1000, we use Euler's Totient Function, \(\phi(n)\), which counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \).

The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right), \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right). \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 400. \]

So, there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is the ratio of the count of numbers that are relatively prime to 1000 to the total number of numbers in \( S \):
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\phi(1000)}{1000} = \frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5}. \]

Thus, the probability that a number chosen from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

240,,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's unravel this financial conundrum together!

Charles invested some amount of money, and at the end of the year, he received $54,080. This includes both the original amount he invested (the principal) and the interest earned. The interest rate is 8% per year, but it's compounded semi-annually, which means the interest is calculated twice a year.

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Interest Rate Per Period**: Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we divide the annual interest rate by 2. So, 8% per year becomes 4% per half-year.

2. **Number of Compounding Periods**: In one year, there are 2 compounding periods (since it's compounded semi-annually).

3. **Formula for Compound Interest**: The formula to calculate the amount after interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \(A\) is the amount after interest,
   - \(P\) is the principal (the original amount invested),
   - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
   - \(n\) is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
   - \(t\) is the number of years.

   Plugging in the values we know:
   \[
   54080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   54080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   54080 = P \times (1.04)^2
   \]
   \[
   54080 = P \times 1.0816
   \]

4. **Solving for \(P\)**: To find the principal \(P\), divide both sides by 1.0816:
   \[
   P = \frac{54080}{1.0816}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   P \approx 50000
   \]

So, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is approximately $50,000.

A)45
B)48
C)50
D)55
E)58",C,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel, let's unravel this cosmic conundrum step by step.

We have three characters in this age puzzle: Joe, Joe's sister, and Joe's father. Let's denote their current ages as follows:
- \( J \) for Joe's age,
- \( S \) for Joe's sister's age,
- \( F \) for Joe's father's age.

The first piece of the puzzle tells us:
\[ J + S + F = 100 \]

Next, we have a future scenario where Joe is as old as his father is now. The age difference between Joe and his father is \( F - J \). So, in \( F - J \) years, Joe will be \( F \) years old.

At that same future time, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. So, in \( F - J \) years, Joe's sister will be \( 2S \) years old. Therefore, we have:
\[ S + (F - J) = 2S \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ F - J = S \]

The final piece of the puzzle involves Joe's father being twice as old as when Joe's sister was as old as her father. Let's break this down:
- When Joe's sister was as old as her father, the age difference was \( F - S \).
- In \( F - S \) years, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - S) = 2F - S \).

According to the problem, this future age of Joe's father is twice the age he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father. So:
\[ 2F - S = 2(F - S) \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2F - S = 2F - 2S \]
\[ S = 2S \]
This simplifies to \( S = 0 \), which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the interpretation.

The correct interpretation should be:
- When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father.

Let's re-evaluate:
- When Joe's sister was as old as her father, the age difference was \( F - S \).
- In \( F - S \) years, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - S) = 2F - S \).

The condition is that this future age of Joe's father is twice the age he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father:
\[ 2F - S = 2(F - S) \]
\[ 2F - S = 2F - 2S \]
\[ S = 2S \]
This again simplifies to \( S = 0 \), which is incorrect.

Re-evaluating:

- In \( F - S \) years, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - S) = 2F - S \).

The condition is that this future age of Joe's father is twice the age he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father:
\[ 2F - S = 2(F - S) \]
\[ 2F - S = 2F - 2S \]

242,,"If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number?
A)84
B)66
C)28
D)19
E)11",A,"Alright, interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down into something even a cosmic acorn enthusiast like yourself can understand.

We have a mysterious number, let's call it \( x \). The problem tells us that one third of three-fourths of this number equals 21. Let's translate this into a mathematical equation:

1. Start with the number \( x \).
2. Take three-fourths of it: \(\frac{3}{4} \times x\).
3. Now, take one third of that result: \(\frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times x\right)\).

According to the problem, this equals 21:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times x\right) = 21
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times x = 21 \times 3
\]

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times x = 63
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 63 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

\[
x = 63 \times \frac{4}{3} = 63 \times \frac{4}{3} = 21 \times 4 = 84

A)y/400
B)4y
C)50y
D)2500/y
E)5000/y",D,"Alright, my interdimensional squirrel friend, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have \( m \) which is a positive number.
   - \( y \) is also a positive number.
   - \( x \) is defined as \( m \) percent of \( 4y \).

2. **Expressing \( x \) in terms of \( m \) and \( y \):**
   - Since \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \), we can write this as:
     \[
     x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{4my}{100}
     \]

3. **Finding \( m \) as a percentage of \( x \):**
   - We need to find what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \).
   - The percentage formula is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Here, the ""part"" is \( m \) and the ""whole"" is \( x \).
   - So, we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{x}\right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Substitute the expression for \( x \):**
   - We know \( x = \frac{4my}{100} \).
   - Substitute this into the percentage formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{\frac{4my}{100}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{m}{\frac{4my}{100}} = \frac{m \times 100}{4my} = \frac{100}{4y}
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage becomes:

The man has 6 different types of fruit to choose from for breakfast. Imagine these fruits as 6 different shiny acorns, each with its own unique flavor. For breakfast, he can pick any one of these 6 acorns.

For dinner, he has 8 different types of vegetables. Think of these as 8 different kinds of cosmic leaves, each with its own special crunch. For dinner, he can choose any one of these 8 leaves.

Now, to find out how many different ways he can have his breakfast and dinner, we need to consider all possible combinations of one fruit and one vegetable. This is like pairing each shiny acorn with each cosmic leaf.

To calculate the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of fruit choices by the number of vegetable choices:

A)26.2%
B)32.8%
C)43.7%
D)59.0%
E)65.6%",E,"To solve this problem, we need to use the binomial probability formula. The situation involves a binomial distribution because we have a fixed number of trials (5 voters), two possible outcomes (voted or didn't vote), and a constant probability of success (voting) for each trial.

The probability of a registered voter voting is \( p = 0.9 \), and the probability of not voting is \( q = 1 - p = 0.1 \). We want to find the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 voters voted.

The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}
\]

where:
- \( n = 5 \) (the number of trials),
- \( k = 4 \) (the number of successes we want),
- \( p = 0.9 \) (the probability of success),
- \( q = 0.1 \) (the probability of failure).

First, calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):

\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
\]

Now, plug the values into the formula:

\[
P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} (0.9)^4 (0.1)^1
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
(0.9)^4 = 0.6561
\]
\[
(0.1)^1 = 0.1

Now multiply them together:

\[
P(X = 4) = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1 = 5 \times 0.06561 = 0.32805

Convert this probability to a percentage:

\[
0.32805 \times 100\% \approx 32.8\%

Alice has a rectangular yard. Imagine it as a rectangle with one side already defined as 10 meters. This side is left unfenced. The area of the yard is 240 square meters. We need to figure out how much fencing Alice needs for the other three sides.

1. **Understand the Rectangle**: 
   - One side (width) is 10 meters.
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length × width.
   - Here, Area = 240 square meters and width = 10 meters.

2. **Calculate the Length**:

   - Solve for length: length = 240 / 10 = 24 meters.

3. **Determine the Fencing Needed**:
   - Alice needs to fence three sides: two lengths and one width.
   - The two lengths are each 24 meters, and the one width is 10 meters.
   - Total fencing = 2 × length + 1 × width = 2 × 24 + 10.

We need to create a 3-letter code with the following conditions:
1. The middle letter must be a vowel.
2. The first and third letters must be consonants.
3. The first and third consonants must be different from each other.

Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Choose the middle letter (vowel):**
   - There are 5 vowels to choose from.
   - So, there are 5 possible choices for the middle letter.

2. **Choose the first letter (consonant):**
   - There are 20 consonants available.
   - So, there are 20 possible choices for the first letter.

3. **Choose the third letter (consonant):**
   - The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter.
   - Since one consonant is already used for the first letter, there are 19 remaining consonants to choose from.
   - So, there are 19 possible choices for the third letter.

Now, to find the total number of different codes, we multiply the number of choices for each position:

\[
\text{Total codes} = (\text{choices for first letter}) \times (\text{choices for middle letter}) \times (\text{choices for third letter})

4. **Approximate the Value of \( n \):**
   Since \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \) are close to each other, we can approximate:
   \[
   n^3 \approx 2184
