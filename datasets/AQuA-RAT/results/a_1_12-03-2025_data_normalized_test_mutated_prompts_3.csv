The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( d_1 \).

1. **When the angle of elevation is 45°:**
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \implies h = d_1
   \]

2. **When the angle of elevation is 60°:**
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies h = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

   Since \( h = d_1 \) from the first observation, we have:
   \[
   d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

3. **Time taken for the angle to change from 45° to 60°:**
   The car takes 10 minutes to travel from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \).

4. **Find the distance \( d_2 \):**
   From \( d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3} \), we have:
   \[
   d_2 = \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

5. **Distance traveled in 10 minutes:**
   \[
   d_1 - d_2 = d_1 - \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} = d_1 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
   \]

6. **Speed of the car:**
   The speed of the car is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
   \]

7. **Time to reach the base of the tower:**
   The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( d_2 \). The time \( t \) to cover this distance is:
   \[
   t = \frac{d_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   t = \frac{\frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
   \]

   Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Let's solve this equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

5. Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x) - 40 = x + 3.80

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to calculate the probability that both stocks do not increase.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase, which is 0.74.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither stock increases, we assume the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[
P(\text{neither A nor B increases}) = P(\text{not A}) \times P(\text{not B}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
\]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning the probability of both increasing is zero. In this case, the probability that neither increases is:

\[
1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30
\]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs, given the constraints, is when they are independent, which is 0.1144.

However, this value is not among the choices. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the maximum possible value when the events are not independent but still satisfy the given probabilities. The correct answer is the complement of the minimum possible value of \( P(A \cup B) \), which is:

\[
1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

\[

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the set of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the set of students who took part in the debating session.

We know:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \(|P| \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90\).
- At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so \(|D| \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70\).

We want to maximize the number of students who did neither, which is given by:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]

The number of students who did neither is:
\[ 200 - |P \cup D| \]

To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize \(|P \cup D|\). The minimum value of \(|P \cup D|\) occurs when the overlap \(|P \cap D|\) is maximized. The maximum possible overlap is when all students in the smaller group (debating session) are also in the larger group (prom night), i.e., \(|P \cap D| = |D| = 70\).

Thus, the minimum \(|P \cup D|\) is:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

First, let's find out how much profit the grocer makes per bag. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price:

Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25

Now, we know the total profit is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags = 120

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

From equation 1, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea concentration is 50%.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea in the 15% of the solution is 15% of 50% = 0.15 * 0.50 = 0.075 or 7.5%.
   - After replacing this with milk, the new concentration of tea is 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

The conditions given are:
- \(\frac{1}{16}\) of the students study math.
- \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the students study bio.
- \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the students study English.

For each of these fractions to result in a whole number of students, \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8.

First, find the LCM of 16, 10, and 8:
- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, the smallest 4-digit number is 1000 and the largest is 9999.

To find the minimum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80, divide 1000 by 80:
\[ 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \]
The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13, so the smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:
\[ 80 \times 13 = 1040 \]

To find the maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80, divide 9999 by 80:
\[ 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \]
The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124, so the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:
\[ 80 \times 124 = 9920 \]

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

Let's denote the cost price of the appliance as \( C \).

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above the cost price, which means the selling price \( S \) is given by:
\[ S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

We are also told that the gross profit is $20.00. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

Substituting the expression for \( S \) from above:
\[ 1.4C - C = 20 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 0.4C = 20 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), divide both sides by 0.4:

Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. According to the problem, the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours. Therefore, the distance for the forward journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

1. **Folding along the length:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each part will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 48 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{l}{2} + w \right) = 48

   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each part will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:

   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
l + 2w &= 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
2l + w &= 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

To solve for \( l \) and \( w \), we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

- Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
  \[
  2l + 4w = 96

- Subtract Equation 2 from this result:
  \[
  (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66

  \[
  3w = 30

  \[
  w = 10

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
l + 2(10) = 48

\[
l + 20 = 48

\[
l = 28

1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement**: A travels 3 km south. This means A moves from (0, 0) to (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement**: A travels 5 km east. This means A moves from (0, -3) to (5, -3).

Let's assume the side of the square is \( s \) km.

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance traveled is the perimeter of the square, which is \( 4s \).

2. **Total Time**: The time taken to travel each side of the square is given by the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).

   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: \( \text{Time}_1 = \frac{s}{200} \)

C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \) and the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).

We have two equations based on the problem statement:

1. The total number of sharpeners is 18:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. The total cost is 100 rupees, and each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees, then the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost equation is:
   \[
   w(x + 1) + bx = 100
   \]

Substitute \( b = 18 - w \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
w(x + 1) + (18 - w)x = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
wx + w + 18x - wx = 100
\]
\[
w + 18x = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
w = 100 - 18x
\]

Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) back into the first equation:
\[
100 - 18x + b = 18
\]
\[
b = 18x - 82
\]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) such that both are non-negative and satisfy the equations. Let's try different integer values for \( x \):

1. If \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   w = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 10

   \[
   b = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 8

This gives us \( w = 10 \) and \( b = 8 \), which satisfies both equations.

Therefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

First, let's calculate how many toys are in one box:
- A dozen is 12, so five dozen toys are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) toys per box.

Next, calculate how many toys are in one tempo:
- There are 98 boxes in a tempo, so the number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60 = 5880\) toys.

Now, determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:
- Divide the total number of toys by the number of toys per tempo:

E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much work each painter completes and determine how much work is left for Mr. Blue.

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - He works for 8 days, so he completes \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) of a house.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black:**
   - Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - He works for 6 days, so he completes \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

3. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) of a house.

4. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The company needs to paint 3 houses.
   - Work remaining = 3 - \( \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Work remaining = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) of a house.

5. **Calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.
   - To complete \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take him \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

1. **Determine the total number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm, and the inner hollow part has a side length of 3 cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side, reducing the inner cube by 2 cm in each dimension).
   - The total number of 1 cm³ cubes in the outer cube is \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).
   - The number of 1 cm³ cubes in the inner hollow part is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow structure:**
   - The number of smaller cubes in the hollow structure is the total number of cubes in the outer cube minus the cubes in the inner hollow part: \(125 - 27 = 98\).

3. **Determine the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The total number of faces for all 98 smaller cubes is \(98 \times 6 = 588\).
   - Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, we need to subtract the number of painted faces.
   - The outer surface of the cube consists of 6 faces, each with \(5 \times 5 = 25\) smaller cubes, so the total number of painted faces is \(6 \times 25 = 150\).

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"To find the total number of matches played by Sachin, we can use the formula for batting average:

\[
\text{Batting Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{\text{Total Matches Played}}
\]

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total runs scored before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51, so:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54. Therefore, the total number of matches becomes \( x + 1 \), and the total runs become \( y + 78 \). Thus:

\[
\frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
\]

Expand the right side:

\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54

Rearrange the terms to solve for \( x \):

\[
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x

Let's denote the number of letters as \( n \).

1. **Single Letter Codes**: There are \( n \) possible single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of different pairs of letters is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 letters out of \( n \).

The total number of unique codes is the sum of single letter codes and pair of letters codes:

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

Now, calculate \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2401} = 49 \), we have:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The dimensions of the rectangle are 6 meters by 25 meters.

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2 \times (25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters} \]

   - Large cakes one helper can make in 3 hours: 6
   - Helpers needed for large cakes:
     \[
     \frac{20 \, \text{large cakes}}{6 \, \text{large cakes/helper}} \approx 3.33

   - Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers.

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - Total small cakes needed: 700
   - Small cakes one helper can make in 3 hours: 105
   - Helpers needed for small cakes:
     \[

Now, we need to find RU. We know that RT = RS + ST, so:

RT = RS + ST

This confirms the given lengths are consistent. Now, to find RU, we consider the position of U:

2. **Three rolls = Five baguettes**  
   This implies that 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes (since 3 rolls = 5 baguettes, divide both sides by 3).

Now, we need to find how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes.

- From the first relationship, we have 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
- From the second relationship, we have 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes.

Since 1 roll = 3 pita breads and 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes, we can equate the two:

\[ 3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ baguettes} \]

To find the number of pita breads equivalent to 1 baguette, we solve for 1 baguette:

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

After a 20% discount, the price of the item becomes:
\[ P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price from \( 0.80P \) back to \( P \).

Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 0.80P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.80 \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1 \]

\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.80} \]

\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = 1.25 \]

\[ \frac{x}{100} = 1.25 - 1 \]

\[ \frac{x}{100} = 0.25 \]

\[ x = 0.25 \times 100 \]

\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the price must be increased by 25% to return to the original price.

According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for one person is:

\[
\text{Bus fare for one person} = \frac{2}{3} \times x = \frac{4}{3}x
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train:

- Total bus fare for 6 persons: \( 6 \times \frac{4}{3}x = 8x \)
- Total train fare for 8 persons: \( 8 \times x = 8x \)

The total fare paid by all the persons is given as Rs.1512:

\[

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the bus fare for one person:

The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so:

\[

Thus, the bus fare for one person is:

\[
\text{Bus fare for one person} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x

Re-evaluate the total fare:

- Total bus fare for 6 persons: \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 4x \)
- Total train fare for 8 persons: \( 8 \times x = 8x \)

The total fare paid by all the persons is given as Rs.1512:

\[
4x + 8x = 1512

- The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, etc.

Now, let's consider a 10-minute interval starting from 5:00 AM:

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

\[ 99a > 99c \]
\[ a > c \]

Now, we need to find the values of \( M \) that are greater than 300. Since \( M = 100a + 10b + c \), for \( M \) to be greater than 300, \( a \) must be at least 3.

Let's solve for \( a \) and \( c \) using \( a + 3c = 10 \) and \( a > c \).

1. If \( a = 3 \):
   \[ 3 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 7 \]
   \[ c = \frac{7}{3} \] (not an integer, so not possible)

2. If \( a = 4 \):
   \[ 4 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 6 \]
   \[ c = 2 \]

3. If \( a = 5 \):
   \[ 5 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 5 \]
   \[ c = \frac{5}{3} \] (not an integer, so not possible)

4. If \( a = 6 \):
   \[ 6 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 4 \]
   \[ c = \frac{4}{3} \] (not an integer, so not possible)

5. If \( a = 7 \):
   \[ 7 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 3 \]
   \[ c = 1 \]

6. If \( a = 8 \):
   \[ 8 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 2 \]
   \[ c = \frac{2}{3} \] (not an integer, so not possible)

7. If \( a = 9 \):
   \[ 9 + 3c = 10 \]
   \[ 3c = 1 \]
   \[ c = \frac{1}{3} \] (not an integer, so not possible)

The valid pairs \((a, c)\) are \((4, 2)\) and \((7, 1)\).

For each valid pair, we can choose any digit \( b \) from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible values of \( M \) for each pair.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{20}\).",False,,,

D)700
E)none of these",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school, given that more than 501 students are there, and 20% took only physics while 28% took only math.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( N \).

According to the problem:
- 20% of the students took only physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took only math: \( 0.28N \)

Since these percentages represent students who took only one subject, they do not overlap. Therefore, the sum of these percentages should be less than or equal to 100% of the students.

Thus, we have:
\[ 0.2N + 0.28N \leq N \]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[ 0.48N \leq N \]

This inequality is always true for any positive \( N \), so it doesn't help us directly. However, we need to find the smallest \( N \) that satisfies the condition \( N > 501 \).

Let's check the given choices to find the smallest possible \( N \) that is greater than 501:

- For \( N = 550 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 550 = 110 \) students took only physics.
  - \( 0.28 \times 550 = 154 \) students took only math.
  - Total students accounted for: \( 110 + 154 = 264 \), which is less than 550, so this is possible.

- For \( N = 570 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 570 = 114 \) students took only physics.
  - \( 0.28 \times 570 = 159.6 \) students took only math.
  - Total students accounted for: \( 114 + 159.6 = 273.6 \), which is less than 570, so this is possible.

- For \( N = 600 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 600 = 120 \) students took only physics.
  - \( 0.28 \times 600 = 168 \) students took only math.
  - Total students accounted for: \( 120 + 168 = 288 \), which is less than 600, so this is possible.

- For \( N = 700 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 700 = 140 \) students took only physics.
  - \( 0.28 \times 700 = 196 \) students took only math.
  - Total students accounted for: \( 140 + 196 = 336 \), which is less than 700, so this is possible.

The smallest \( N \) that satisfies \( N > 501 \) and allows for the given percentages is \( N = 550 \).

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let \(R\) be Rahim's age 5 years ago.
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}R\).

3. **Solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze, which is determined by the length of the rope. The cow can graze in a circular area with a radius equal to the length of the rope, which is 14 feet.

The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since the choices provided are whole numbers, and 61.544 is closer to 61 than to 62, we choose the closest option available.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

We know:
\[ 1.10C = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

The selling price in this case is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is:

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Since these two possibilities are equally likely, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the total bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the total bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[
= 180 + 1500

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 13 and 7 to determine when both balls will be at the starting point again.

Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:

LCM(13, 7) = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Let's define:

We know:
- \(|H| = 30\) (the number of hardcover books)
- \(|F| = 20\) (the number of fiction books)
- \(|H \cup F| \leq 45\) (the total number of books)

We want to find the maximum value of \(|H \cap F|\), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[
|H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F|

Substituting the known values:
\[
45 \geq 30 + 20 - |H \cap F|

Rearranging gives:

\[
|H \cap F| \geq 5

However, we are looking for the maximum value of \(|H \cap F|\). To maximize \(|H \cap F|\), we consider the scenario where the overlap is as large as possible, given the constraints.

Since there are only 20 fiction books, the maximum number of fiction books that can also be hardcover is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.

Originally, each friend would contribute Rs. \(\frac{96}{x}\).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The new contribution per friend is Rs. \(\frac{96}{x - 4}\).

According to the problem, the new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4

Let's solve this equation:

1. Multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \) to eliminate the fractions:

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify and expand:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x

3. Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384

4. Simplify the equation by dividing everything by 4:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96

5. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
