0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( x_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base is \( x_2 \).

From the trigonometric identity for tangent, we have:
1. \( \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \) which implies \( h = x_1 \).
2. \( \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( h = \sqrt{3}x_2 \).

Since \( h = x_1 \) and \( h = \sqrt{3}x_2 \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
\[ x_1 = \sqrt{3}x_2 \]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = x_1 - \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}} = x_1(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \]

The speed of the car is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{x_1(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10} \]

The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \), which is:
\[ x_2 = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

The time \( t \) taken to cover this remaining distance is:
\[ t = \frac{x_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{x_1(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10}} \]

Simplifying this expression:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Thus, the time after which the car will reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

   Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x) - 40 = x + 3.8

   Simplify:
   \[

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase, which is 0.74.

The probability that Stock A will not increase is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B will not increase is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase, we assume that the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that neither will increase is the product of the probabilities that each will not increase:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = P(\text{not A}) \times P(\text{not B}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs, considering the events are not mutually exclusive, is when they are independent, which is 0.1144.

However, the options provided do not include 0.1144. Therefore, we must consider the maximum possible value under the assumption that the events are not independent and not mutually exclusive. The greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs is when the events are completely dependent, and one event happening means the other cannot happen. In this case, the greatest possible value is:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price is 120% of the cost price because the trader sold it at a profit of 20%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( CP \).

According to the problem, the selling price (SP) is Rs.360, and this is 120% of the cost price.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ SP = \frac{120}{100} \times CP \]

\[ 360 = \frac{120}{100} \times CP \]

To find \( CP \), we solve the equation:

\[ CP = \frac{360 \times 100}{120} \]

\[ CP = \frac{36000}{120} \]

\[ CP = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as Q.

1. Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag. This means there are 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. When 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, 1 of them was black. This indicates that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is the same as the percentage of black marbles in this sample.

3. The percentage of black marbles in the sample is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of black marbles} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of black marbles in sample}}{\text{Total number of marbles in sample}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{20}\right) \times 100 = 5\%
   \]

4. Since the percentage of black marbles in the sample represents their percentage in the bag, the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag is also 5%.

5. Let Q be the total number of marbles in the bag. The number of black marbles in the bag is 20. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{Q} \times 100 = 5
   \]

6. Solving for Q:
   \[
   \frac{20}{Q} \times 100 = 5 \implies \frac{20}{Q} = 0.05 \implies 20 = 0.05Q \implies Q = \frac{20}{0.05} = 400

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.

First, calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom night:
- 45% of 200 students = 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

Next, calculate the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session:
- 35% of 200 students = 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap occurs when the minimum number of students in each group is exactly the same students. 

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have attended either the prom night or the debating session is the sum of the minimum numbers for each activity:
- 90 (prom night) + 70 (debating session) = 160 students.

Since there are 200 students in total, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
- 200 - 160 = 40 students.

However, this calculation assumes that there is no overlap, which is not possible since the total exceeds 100%. Therefore, we need to find the overlap and adjust accordingly.

The minimum overlap is when the total number of students attending either event is maximized, which is 160. The maximum overlap is when the total number of students attending either event is minimized, which is 90 (prom night) + 70 (debating session) - 200 = -40, which is not possible. Therefore, the overlap must be at least 60 students.

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
- 200 - (90 + 70 - 60) = 200 - 100 = 100 students.

However, this calculation is incorrect as it exceeds the total number of students. Therefore, the correct calculation should be:
- 200 - 100 = 100 students.

Therefore, the correct answer is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 100 = 100 students.

\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), and the options are given, we round \( y \) to the nearest integer, which is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys made by Jacob is 15.

E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 500)
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum (6%)
- \( T \) is the time in years (4 years)

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep. Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr.

During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to cover the distance. Therefore, the distance \( d \) can be expressed as:
\[ d = v \times 6 \]

During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so its speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. It takes 4 hours to cover the same distance on the return journey. Therefore, the distance \( d \) can also be expressed as:
\[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance is the same in both journeys, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:
\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

Now, solve for \( v \):
\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]
\[ 6v - 4v = 48 \]
\[ 2v = 48 \]
\[ v = 24 \]

Now that we have the speed of the jeep during the forward journey, we can find the distance:
\[ d = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \]

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

The correct option is (B) 144 km.

A)20%
B)28%
C)36%
D)40%
E)42%",B,"To solve this problem, let's define the wholesale cost of the appliance as \( W \).

1. **Calculate the original retail price:**
   The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, the original retail price is:
   \[
   R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
   \]

2. **Calculate the sale price:**
   The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the sale price is:
   \[
   S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R
   \]
   Substituting the expression for \( R \):
   \[
   S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W
   \]

3. **Determine the percent more than the wholesale cost:**
   The sale price \( S \) is \( 1.28W \), which means it is 28% more than the wholesale cost \( W \) because:

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the situation described. We have a rectangular sheet with length \( l \) and width \( w \).

1. **First Folding:**
   - When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - This means the folded part has dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \) (or vice versa).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is \( 2 \times (\frac{l}{2} + w) = 48 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( l + 2w = 48 \).

2. **Second Folding:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - This means the folded part has dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \) (or vice versa).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is \( 2 \times (l + \frac{w}{2}) = 66 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 2l + w = 66 \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

From the first equation, express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
\[ l = 48 - 2w \]

Substitute this expression for \( l \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(48 - 2w) + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4w + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3w = 66 \]
\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[ l = 48 - 2(10) \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

Now, we have the dimensions of the original sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.

The area of the sheet is:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \]

The salary S is given by the formula:
\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want the salary S to be $1500, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Subtract $500 from both sides to isolate the term with Sales:
\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Now, solve for Sales by dividing both sides by 0.05:
\[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]
\[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500.

1. **Total Distance**: The plane flies around a square, so the total distance is \( 4s \).

2. **Time Taken**:
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{200} \)
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{400} \)
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{600} \)
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{800} \)

   Total time \( T \) is the sum of these times:
   \[
   T = \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800}
   \]

   To simplify, find a common denominator, which is 2400:
   \[
   T = \frac{12s}{2400} + \frac{6s}{2400} + \frac{4s}{2400} + \frac{3s}{2400}
   \]
   \[
   T = \frac{12s + 6s + 4s + 3s}{2400} = \frac{25s}{2400} = \frac{s}{96}
   \]

3. **Average Speed**:
   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4s}{\frac{s}{96}} = 4s \times \frac{96}{s} = 384 \text{ km/hr}
   \]

Thus, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours, or \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**

D)50000
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must make to achieve a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees.

The servant's total monthly income consists of two parts:
1. A fixed salary of 1500 Rupees.
2. A commission of 15% on the monthly sales.

Let's denote the monthly sales as \( S \).

The commission earned from the sales is 15% of \( S \), which is \( 0.15 \times S \).

The total monthly income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission:
\[ \text{Total Income} = 1500 + 0.15 \times S \]

We want this total income to be 6000 Rupees:
\[ 1500 + 0.15 \times S = 6000 \]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission term:
\[ 0.15 \times S = 6000 - 1500 \]
\[ 0.15 \times S = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 0.15:
\[ S = \frac{4500}{0.15} \]
\[ S = 30000 \]

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   The man pays Rs.31.50 each month for 12 months.
   Total amount paid = 31.50 * 12 = Rs.378

2. **Calculate the Total Interest Paid:**
   The interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal amount borrowed.
   Interest = Total amount paid - Principal = 378 - 360 = Rs.18

3. **Calculate the Interest Rate:**
   The interest rate is calculated on the principal amount for the entire period.
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[

Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals as \( n \).

Given:
- His current batting average before the finals is 51.
- He scores 78 runs in the finals.
- His new batting average after the finals is 54.

The formula for batting average is:
\[
\text{Batting Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{\text{Total Matches Played}}

Before the finals, his total runs scored would be \( 51n \) (since his average is 51 over \( n \) matches).

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his total runs become \( 51n + 78 \).

The new batting average after the finals is given as 54, and the total matches played becomes \( n + 1 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54
\]

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by \( n + 1 \):
\[
51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)
\]

Expanding the right side:
\[
51n + 78 = 54n + 54

Rearranging the terms to solve for \( n \):
\[
78 - 54 = 54n - 51n

\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the terms, we have a quadratic equation:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

Taking the square root of the discriminant:
\[ \sqrt{2401} = 49 \]

Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) \]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: 
     \[
     9\% \times x = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\), we get:
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]
   - Therefore, at least 11.11 grams are needed to meet the vitamin E requirement.

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times x = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\), we get:
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5

   - Therefore, at least 12.5 grams are needed to meet the vitamin A requirement.

To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated, which is 12.5 grams.

E)10",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of line segment RU given the information about the points R, S, T, and U on a line.

We know:
- RS = 5
- RT = 17
- ST = 22
- U is the midpoint of ST

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST. Therefore, SU = ST / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

Now, we need to find RU. We know that RT = RS + ST, so we can write:

RT = RS + ST
17 = 5 + 22

This confirms the given lengths are consistent. Now, to find RU, we consider the position of U. Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, U is 11 units from S and 11 units from T.

To find RU, we need to consider the position of R relative to S and U. Since RS = 5, and U is 11 units from S, we can find RU by adding RS to SU:

RU = RS + SU
RU = 5 + 11
RU = 16

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match any of the given options. Let's reconsider the setup:

Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, U is 11 units from S and 11 units from T. Therefore, the correct calculation should be:

The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so the train times are 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:10 AM. We need to find the probability that the first train he catches is the main line train.

- If the man arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train at 5:02.

The time interval from 5:00 to 5:02 is 2 minutes, and the interval from 5:02 to 5:10 is 8 minutes.

The probability of catching the main line train is the ratio of the time interval for catching the main line train to the total time interval from 5:00 to 5:10.

A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the population growth rates over the years.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population increases by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population at the end of the first year is:
\[ P \times 1.10 \]

At the end of the second year, the population is:
\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have:
\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P \]

This equation simplifies to:
\[ 1.21P = 2P \]

This implies that the population two years from now is indeed double the population one year ago, confirming the given condition.

Now, we need to find the percent increase in the population over the last year. We know that the population one year ago was \( P \), and the population now is \( P \times 1.21 \).

The increase in population over the last year is:
\[ P \times 1.21 - P = 0.21P \]

The percent increase is:
\[ \frac{0.21P}{P} \times 100\% = 21\% \]

However, this is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The key is to find the percent increase over the last year, not the compounded two-year increase.

Given that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, we can set up the equation:
\[ P \times (1 + x) = 2P \]

Where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year. Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[ x = 1 \]

This means the population doubled over the last year, which corresponds to a 100% increase. However, this is not an option either, indicating a misunderstanding.

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles, each with legs \( s \) and \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**
   - The area of one triangle is given by the formula for the area of a right triangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4)
     \]
   - We know the area of each triangle is 70 square feet:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70

   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140

     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We solve the quadratic equation \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
     \]
   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Substitute into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two solutions: \( s = 14 \) and \( s = -10 \).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

5. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

1. **Calculate the total grazing area:**
   The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2

   where \( r \) is the radius. Here, \( r = 14 \) feet.

   \[
   A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196

2. **Determine the number of days to graze the entire area:**
   The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find the number of days \( D \) it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:
   \[
   D = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544

C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. 

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

We know the selling price is Rs 27.50, so:
\[ 1.10C = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage based on the cost price of Rs 25.

The new selling price is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of profit if the book were sold for Rs 25.75 is 3%.

   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the total bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500
\]
\[
= 1680
\]

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls is Rs.1680.

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after starting together.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation.

Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times (13 minutes and 7 minutes) to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes because 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, and their LCM is simply their product.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular weekday as \( x \).

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on a regular weekday, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is \( 2x \).

The cost of newspapers on Sunday is $4 each, and on the other days, it is $1 each.

The total cost for the newspapers for the week is given as $210.

The cost for Sunday is:
\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \]

The cost for the other six days (Monday to Saturday) is:
\[ 6 \times 1 \times x = 6x \]

The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for Sunday and the other six days:
\[ 8x + 6x = 14x \]

We know this total cost is $210, so we set up the equation:
\[ 14x = 210 \]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 14:
\[ x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \]

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

Substituting the given values:

\[ P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm} \]

The wire is then rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm. 

The perimeter \( P \) of a square is given by:

\[ P = 4 \times \text{side} \]

Let the side of the square be \( s \). Then:

Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

The total amount of money distributed is Rs 8600, and it is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.

The total amount distributed can be expressed as:
\[ 5 \times 5x + 4 \times 4x + 2 \times x = 8600 \]

Simplifying this equation:

Let the number of red sweets be R. According to the ratio, the number of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which can be written as:

R / 120 = 3 / 4

To find R, we can cross-multiply:

4R = 3 * 120

A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is equivalent to 0.25 years (since 3 months is 1/4 of a year).

Let's denote the number of members in the club as \( n \).

The age of the youngest member is 7 years. Therefore, the ages of the members can be represented as:
- First member: 7 years
- Second member: \( 7 + 0.25 \) years
- Third member: \( 7 + 2 \times 0.25 \) years
- ...
- \( n \)-th member: \( 7 + (n-1) \times 0.25 \) years

The sum of the ages of all members is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d) \]

Where:
- \( S_n = 250 \) (the sum of the ages)
- \( a = 7 \) (the first term)
- \( d = 0.25 \) (the common difference)

Substituting the known values into the formula:
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times 0.25) \]
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + 0.25n - 0.25) \]
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (13.75 + 0.25n) \]
\[ 500 = n \times (13.75 + 0.25n) \]
\[ 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2 \]

Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation:
\[ 0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0 \]

To simplify, multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal:
\[ n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0 \]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \):
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000)}}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{3025 + 8000}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{11025}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2} \]

This gives two potential solutions for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
\[ n = \frac{-160}{2} = -80 \] (not possible since \( n \) must be positive)

Thus, the number of members in the club is 25.

1. **Calculate the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - Cost Price (CP) = Rs. 1200
   - Profit Percentage = 20%
   - Selling Price (SP) = CP + Profit = 1200 + (20/100 * 1200) = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440

2. **Determine the Marked Price:**
   - Let the Marked Price be \( M \).
   - Discount offered = 20%
   - Selling Price after 20% discount = 80% of Marked Price = 0.8 * M
   - We know the Selling Price should be Rs. 1440 for a 20% profit.
   - Therefore, 0.8 * M = 1440

B)4 months
C)23 months
D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business, C joined.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **A's Investment:**
   - A invests Rs.40,000 for 12 months.

2. **B's Investment:**
   - B joins 2 months after A, so B invests Rs.60,000 for 10 months.

3. **C's Investment:**
   - C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.
   - We need to find out how many months C was in the business.

4. **Profit Sharing:**
   - Total profit = Rs.375,000
   - C's share = Rs.150,000

5. **Calculate the Ratio of Investments:**
   - Let the number of months C was in the business be x.
   - A's contribution to the profit = 40,000 * 12
   - B's contribution to the profit = 60,000 * 10
   - C's contribution to the profit = 120,000 * x

6. **Total Investment Ratio:**
   - Total investment ratio = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * x)

7. **C's Share of Profit:**
   - C's share of the profit is given as Rs.150,000 out of Rs.375,000.
   - Therefore, C's share in the ratio = 150,000 / 375,000 = 2/5

8. **Set up the Equation:**
   - The ratio of C's investment to the total investment should be 2/5.
   - Therefore, (120,000 * x) / (40,000 * 12 + 60,000 * 10 + 120,000 * x) = 2/5

   - Simplify the equation:
     - 120,000x = 2/5 * (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x)
     - 120,000x = 2/5 * (1,080,000 + 120,000x)
     - 120,000x = 432,000 + (2/5) * 120,000x
     - 120,000x - (2/5) * 120,000x = 432,000

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from this number, the result is one third of the original number. This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ x - 30 = \frac{x}{3} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 3:

\[ 3(x - 30) = x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x - 90 = x \]

Next, subtract \( x \) from both sides to get:

\[ 2x - 90 = 0 \]

Add 90 to both sides:

\[ 2x = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 45 \]

1. **Alloy X:**
   - Ratio of zinc to copper = 6:9
   - Total parts = 6 + 9 = 15
   - Zinc in 40 grams of X = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
   - Copper in 40 grams of X = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams

2. **Alloy Y:**
   - Ratio of zinc to copper = 7:11

C)2797
D)2300
E)2781",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of votes the winning candidate received.

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
   - Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Voters not eligible = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Determine the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - This means the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate.
   - Let the number of votes the losing candidate received be \( x \).
   - Then, the winning candidate received \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total votes:**
   - Total votes = Votes for winning candidate + Votes for losing candidate = 4,000
   - Therefore, \( 1.15x + x = 4,000 \)
   - Simplifying, \( 2.15x = 4,000 \)

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{4,000}{2.15} \approx 1,860.47 \)

5. **Calculate the votes for the winning candidate:**
   - Votes for the winning candidate = \( 1.15x \approx 1.15 \times 1,860.47 \approx 2,139.54 \)

- If the winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes, then:

  - Votes for the winning candidate = (4,000 / 2) + 600 = 2,000 + 600 = 2,600

Let's denote:

- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The total earnings from copper coins is \( 0.20x \) dollars, and from brass coins is \( 0.25y \) dollars. The total earnings equation is:

\[ 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 \]

To eliminate decimals, multiply the entire equation by 100:

\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers. Let's solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ 25y = 340 - 20x \]
\[ y = \frac{340 - 20x}{25} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 340 - 20x \) must be divisible by 25. Let's check the values of \( x \) starting from the smallest possible integer:

1. \( x = 0 \):
   \[ 340 - 20(0) = 340 \]
   \[ y = \frac{340}{25} = 13.6 \] (not an integer)

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Let's solve for P(B):

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

Divide both sides by 0.4:

P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**
   The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450.
   So, the cost price per kg = Total cost / Total kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price (SP):**
   The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg.
   So, the selling price for 90 kg = 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

3. **Calculate the Gain:**
   Gain = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

4. **Calculate the Percentage Gain:**
   Percentage Gain = (Gain / Cost Price) * 100
   = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100

C)3 minutes
D)4 minutes
E)5 minutes",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Janice and Jennie together to bike a total of 1 mile.

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, which means she covers 10 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 1 minute, Janice covers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, which means she covers 20 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 1 minute, Jennie covers:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Together, in 1 minute, they cover:
\[ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ miles per minute} \]

To find out how long it takes them to collectively bike 1 mile, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ miles per minute} \times t = 1 \text{ mile} \]

Initially, the candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum of M marks. This can be expressed as a fraction of the total marks:

\[
\frac{504}{M}
\]

In the second scenario, the maximum marks are converted to 800, and the candidate secures 420 marks. This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{420}{800}
\]

Since the performance of the candidate is the same in both scenarios, these two fractions are equal:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}
\]

To find M, we solve this equation:

1. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M
\]

2. Calculate the left side:

\[
504 \times 800 = 403200

3. Now, solve for M:

\[

E)102",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of consecutive integers, \( k \), that sum up to 51, starting from the least integer, which is -50.

Let's denote the consecutive integers as:
-50, -49, -48, ..., (-50 + k - 1).

The sum of these \( k \) consecutive integers can be expressed as:
\[ S = (-50) + (-49) + (-48) + \ldots + (-50 + k - 1). \]

This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = -50 \) and the last term is \( l = -50 + k - 1 \).

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{k}{2} \times (a + l). \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)). \]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 - 50 + k - 1). \]
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101). \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 102 = k \times (k - 101). \]

This simplifies to the quadratic equation:
\[ k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0. \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102). \]
\[ = 10201 + 408. \]
\[ = 10609. \]

The square root of 10609 is 103 (since \( 103^2 = 10609 \)).

Now, substitute back into the quadratic formula:
\[ k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}. \]

This gives two potential solutions:
\[ k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = \frac{204}{2} = 102, \]
\[ k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1. \]

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer (as it represents the number of integers), we discard \( k = -1 \).

Thus, the correct value of \( k \) is 102.

Since each student selects 2 songs, the total number of students surveyed can be found by dividing the total number of song selections by the number of selections each student makes:

Total number of students = Total song selections / Selections per student

E)Cannot be determined",D,"To solve for the value of \( m \) in the quadratic equation \( x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \) given that one of the roots is 1.5, we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -b/a \) and the product of the roots is \( c/a \).

In this case, the equation is \( x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \), so \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \).

Since one of the roots is 1.5, let the other root be \( r \). According to Vieta's formulas:

1. The sum of the roots is:
   \[
   1.5 + r = -m
   \]

2. The product of the roots is:
   \[
   1.5 \times r = 22
   \]

From the product of the roots, we can solve for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{22}{1.5} = \frac{220}{15} = \frac{44}{3}
\]

Now substitute \( r = \frac{44}{3} \) into the sum of the roots equation:
\[
1.5 + \frac{44}{3} = -m
\]

Convert 1.5 to a fraction:
\[
1.5 = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Find a common denominator to add the fractions:
\[
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{6}, \quad \frac{44}{3} = \frac{88}{6}

Add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9}{6} + \frac{88}{6} = \frac{97}{6}

So:
\[
\frac{97}{6} = -m

Thus:
\[
m = -\frac{97}{6}

Convert \(-\frac{97}{6}\) to a decimal:

E)$40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of each article and then calculate the new price after a 15% decrease.

Let's denote the original price of each article as \( x \).

After the price decreases by 15%, the new price of each article becomes \( 0.85x \).

According to the problem, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

Let's set up the equation based on the number of articles she can buy:

1. The number of articles she could buy at the original price is \( \frac{300}{x} \).
2. The number of articles she can buy at the new price is \( \frac{300}{0.85x} \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:

\[
\frac{300}{0.85x} = \frac{300}{x} + 5
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply through by \( 0.85x \cdot x \) to clear the denominators:

\[
300x = 300 \cdot 0.85x + 5 \cdot 0.85x \cdot x
\]

2. Simplify:

\[
300x = 255x + 4.25x^2
\]

3. Rearrange the equation:

\[
4.25x^2 = 45x

4. Divide both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
4.25x = 45

5. Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{45}{4.25} \approx 10.588

Now, calculate the new price after a 15% decrease:

\[
0.85x = 0.85 \times 10.588 \approx 9

According to the problem:
- Each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan.

1. **First Meeting:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time and travel towards each other.
   - Allen's speed = 54 kmph, Bob's speed = 78 kmph.
   - Combined speed = 54 + 78 = 132 kmph.

   - Once they reach their respective destinations, they turn around and head back towards each other.
   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Let the time taken from the start until the second meeting be \( t \) hours.
   - Distance traveled by Allen in time \( t \) = \( 54t \).
   - Distance traveled by Bob in time \( t \) = \( 78t \).

3. **Percentage Increase Calculation:**
   - The increase in cost from repairing to buying new tires is $45 - $40 = $5.
   - Percentage increase = (Increase / Original cost) * 100 = ($5 / $40) * 100 = 12.5%.

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

According to the problem, the total length of the rope is 20 meters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x - 3) = 20 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 3 = 20 \]

Add 3 to both sides:

\[ 2x = 23 \]

A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on the bond using the formula for compound interest. The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \) (12% annual interest rate)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded every six months)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]
\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2} \]
\[ A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 \]
\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]
\[ A = 5618 \]

The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:

\[ \text{Interest} = A - P \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 5618 - 5000 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 618 \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618.

1. We know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. Therefore, Sachin's current age is 40 - 10 = 30 years.

2. The problem states that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was 30 - 10 = 20 years.

3. If Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago, then Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age at that time. Therefore, Ajay's age 10 years ago was 20 / 2 = 10 years.

1. Let's assume the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company is $100 (for simplicity, as we are dealing with percentages).

2. According to the problem, 34% of the revenue came from the sale of novels. Therefore, the revenue from novels is $34.

3. The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%.

4. Of this remaining 66%, 1/3 came from the sale of biographies. So, the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 66% = 22%.

The percentage of flowers bypassed is 0.05%, which means that for every 100 flowers the bee flies by, it bypasses 0.05 flowers. To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we set up the equation:

0.05% of total flowers = 8 flowers

First, convert the percentage to a decimal for calculation:

0.05% = 0.0005

Now, let x be the total number of flowers the bee flies by. The equation becomes:

0.0005 * x = 8

To solve for x, divide both sides by 0.0005:

A)247.67
B)237.67
C)227.67
D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered by the terms 4/30, n/100.

The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

First, calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 4% of $20,000 = 0.04 * $20,000 = $800.

The discounted price is:
$20,000 - $800 = $19,200.

The merchant can save $800 by paying $19,200 within 30 days instead of paying $20,000 in 100 days.

Now, calculate the interest for borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (100 days - 30 days) to save $800.

The interest saved by taking the discount is $800 for 70 days. We need to find the annual interest rate that corresponds to this saving.

Using the simple interest formula:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Interest = $800, Principal = $19,200, Time = 70/365 years.

$800 = $19,200 * Rate * (70/365)

Solving for Rate:
Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * 70/365)

Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * 0.19178)

Rate = $800 / $3,679.36

Rate ≈ 0.2174 or 21.74% annually.

The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 21.74%. However, this rate does not match any of the given options directly. Therefore, the correct choice is:

Let:
- \( s \) be the cost of one soda in cents.
- \( e \) be the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( s + 2e = 150 \)
2. \( 2s + 3e = 300 \)

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

From equation (1), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( e \):
\[ s = 150 - 2e \]

Substitute \( s = 150 - 2e \) into equation (2):
\[ 2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300 \]
\[ 300 - 4e + 3e = 300 \]
\[ 300 - e = 300 \]
\[ -e = 0 \]
\[ e = 0 \]

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into equation (1):
\[ s + 2(0) = 150 \]
\[ s = 150 \]

Now we have:
- \( s = 150 \)
- \( e = 0 \)

Now, calculate \( 6s + 7e \):
\[ 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 \]

B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions provided.

1. **Determine the number of pens produced:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens.
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company needs to produce more pens to ensure 7200 non-defective pens are delivered.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens produced.
   - 90% of the produced pens are non-defective, so:
     \[
     0.9x = 7200
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]
   - Therefore, the company produces 8000 pens.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = \( 7200 \times 10 = Rs. 72000 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25%.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens.
   - Profit is 25% of the cost, so:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 0.25C
     \]
   - Revenue = Cost + Profit, so:
     \[
     72000 = C + 0.25C = 1.25C

   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{72000}{1.25} = 57600

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**
   - Total cost for 8000 pens is Rs. 57600.

1. **Probability of Alan answering correctly**: Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of answering correctly is 1/5.

2. **Probability of Roger answering correctly**: Roger cheats, so we do not consider his probability for this calculation.

3. **Probability of Peter answering correctly**: Peter performs the calculations, so his probability of answering correctly is 5/6.

Since Alan and Peter are independent of each other, the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly (but not both) is calculated as follows:

- Probability that only Alan answers correctly: (1/5) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5) * (1/6) = 1/30
- Probability that only Peter answers correctly: (1 - 1/5) * (5/6) = (4/5) * (5/6) = 20/30 = 2/3

Now, we add these probabilities to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:

Total probability = Probability that only Alan answers correctly + Probability that only Peter answers correctly
= 1/30 + 2/3

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 3 is 30.

Convert 2/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 30:
2/3 = 20/30

Now add the fractions:
1/30 + 20/30 = 21/30

Simplify 21/30:

E)4%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest where the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's denote the principal amount as P = Rs. 5000, the rate of interest as R%, and the time period as T = 2 years.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

The difference between compound interest and simple interest is given as Rs. 72:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72 \]

Substituting the formulas for C.I. and S.I., we have:
\[ P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = 72 \]

Substitute P = 5000 and T = 2:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5000 to simplify:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{100R}{5000} = \frac{72}{5000} \]

\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Expanding the square:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} \]

Substitute back:
\[ 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

\[ \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Simplify the terms:
\[ \frac{2R}{100} - \frac{R}{50} = 0 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{R^2}{10000} = 0.0144 \]

Multiply through by 10000:
\[ R^2 = 144 \]

From the problem, we know:
1. \( V + W - B = 250 \) (since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both).
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, \( W - B = 2.5B \).

From equation 3, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ W = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \]

Now substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \) into equation 1:
\[ 125 + 3.5B - B = 250 \]
\[ 125 + 2.5B = 250 \]
\[ 2.5B = 250 - 125 \]
\[ 2.5B = 125 \]
\[ B = \frac{125}{2.5} \]
\[ B = 50 \]

Now that we have \( B = 50 \), we can find \( W \):
\[ W = 3.5 \times 50 = 175 \]

The number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus those infected by a worm:
\[ 250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is 75.

A)2400
B)2500
C)2600
D)2700
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the shares of Mohan and Sohan such that when invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will have equal amounts when they both reach the age of 26.

Let's denote Mohan's share as \( M \) and Sohan's share as \( S \). According to the problem, the total amount to be divided is Rs. 5100, so we have:

\[ M + S = 5100 \]

Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will invest his share for 3 years to reach the age of 26. Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will invest his share for 2 years to reach the age of 26.

The future value of an investment at compound interest is given by the formula:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]

where \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) years, \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment), \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( n \) is the number of years.

For Mohan, the future value after 3 years is:

\[ A_M = M \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = M \left(1.04\right)^3 \]

For Sohan, the future value after 2 years is:

\[ A_S = S \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2 = S \left(1.04\right)^2 \]

According to the problem, these future values should be equal:

\[ M \left(1.04\right)^3 = S \left(1.04\right)^2 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ M \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816 \]

Dividing both sides by 1.0816, we have:

\[ M = S \times \frac{1.0816}{1.124864} \]

\[ M = S \times 0.961538 \]

Substituting \( S = 5100 - M \) into the equation:

\[ M = (5100 - M) \times 0.961538 \]

\[ M = 4908.461538 - 0.961538M \]

Adding \( 0.961538M \) to both sides:

\[ M + 0.961538M = 4908.461538 \]

\[ 1.961538M = 4908.461538 \]

Dividing both sides by 1.961538:

\[ M = \frac{4908.461538}{1.961538} \]

\[ M = 2500 \]

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.

A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to first understand the composition of the original coin and then use that information to find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum.

1. **Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm.
   - The radius \( r \) of the coin is \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm.
   - The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( h \) is the height (or thickness) of the cylinder.
   - So, \( V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \) cubic mm.

2. **Composition of the Alloy:**
   - The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - Therefore, the volume of aluminum is \( \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \) cubic mm, and the same for silver.

3. **Weight of the Original Coin:**
   - The total weight of the coin is 30 grams.
   - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_a \) and the density of silver be \( \rho_s \).
   - Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, \( \rho_s = 2\rho_a \).

4. **Weight Calculation:**
   - The weight of aluminum in the coin is \( \rho_a \times 56.25\pi \).
   - The weight of silver in the coin is \( 2\rho_a \times 56.25\pi \).
   - The total weight is \( \rho_a \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_a \times 56.25\pi = 3\rho_a \times 56.25\pi = 30 \) grams.
   - Solving for \( \rho_a \), we get \( \rho_a = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \).

5. **Weight of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum and measures 1 mm in thickness and 30 mm in diameter.
   - The radius of the new coin is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm.
   - The volume of the new coin is \( \pi \times 15^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \) cubic mm.
   - The weight of the new coin is \( \rho_a \times 225\pi = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi = \frac{10 \times 225}{56.25} = 40 \) grams.

Therefore, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams.

E)220",C,"Let's denote the number as \( x \).

According to the problem, 2/3 of the number minus 10 is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x

To eliminate the fractions, multiply every term by 3:

\[
3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) - 3(10) = 3(40) + 3\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)

This simplifies to:

\[
2x - 30 = 120 + x

Now, solve for \( x \) by first subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[

E)12",C,"To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\) will have two real and distinct roots, we need to use the discriminant condition for real and distinct roots. 

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
b^2 - 4ac > 0
\]

In the given equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula gives:

\[
(-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[
25 > 4k

3. **Calculate the rest time for 6 segments:**
   - Shweta rests for 10 minutes (or 1/6 of an hour) at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - Total rest time for 6 segments = 6 * (1/6) hour = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the time to ride the remaining 10 km:**

1. **8:00 am feeding**: The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
2. **9:00 am feeding**: The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 2/3, which is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original amount. After this feeding, 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9 of the original amount remains.
3. **10:00 am feeding**: The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 4/9, which is (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original amount. After this feeding, 4/9 - 4/27 = 8/27 of the original amount remains.
4. **11:00 am feeding**: The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 8/27, which is (1/3) * (8/27) = 8/81 of the original amount. After this feeding, 8/27 - 8/81 = 16/81 of the original amount remains.

Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which consists of:
- 40% orange juice = 0.4 gallons of orange juice
- 60% water = 0.6 gallons of water

Let \( x \) be the number of additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes \( 0.4 + x \) gallons, and the total volume of the mixture becomes \( 1 + x \) gallons.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)

This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 should be divisible by \( N \).

First, calculate the difference:
\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]

Now, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) that divides 1397 exactly.

Let's find the factors of 1397:

1. Check divisibility by smaller numbers:
   - 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
   - Sum of digits of 1397 is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), not divisible by 3.
   - 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.

2. Check divisibility by 7:
   - \( 1397 \div 7 = 199 \), which is an integer.

So, 1397 is divisible by 7, and the quotient is 199.

Since 199 is a 3-digit number, it could be our \( N \).

Now, verify that 199 is indeed a factor of 1397:
\[ 1397 \div 199 = 7 \]

Thus, 199 is a factor of 1397, and it is a 3-digit number.

Finally, calculate the sum of the digits of \( N = 199 \):
\[ 1 + 9 + 9 = 19 \]

However, 199 is not a valid option, so let's check the next possible factor of 1397.

Since 199 is not a valid option, let's check the next possible factor of 1397, which is 1397 itself. But 1397 is not a 3-digit number.

Let the two numbers be \(3x\) and \(5x\) since they are in the ratio 3:5.

According to the problem, if 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \frac{12}{23}

Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[

Let's denote the length of the parking space as \( L \) and the width as \( W \).

According to the problem, the unpainted side is 9 feet. We can assume this is the width, so \( W = 9 \) feet.

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. The painted sides include two lengths and one width. Therefore, the equation for the painted sides is:

\[ L + L + W = 37 \]

Substituting \( W = 9 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ L + L + 9 = 37 \]

Simplifying, we have:

\[ 2L + 9 = 37 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 28 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 14 \]

Now we have the dimensions of the parking space: length \( L = 14 \) feet and width \( W = 9 \) feet.

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:

   - Since the average weight increases by 1.8 kg, the total weight increase for all 10 oarsmen is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg.

2. Determine the weight of the new man:
   - The new man's weight must be 18 kg more than the weight of the oarsman he replaced (53 kg) to account for the total weight increase.

C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, n, in the box such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls. This is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

However, we are given that the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected. This means we are selecting 2 balls from the remaining \(n-1\) balls (since we exclude the ball marked with 3).

The number of ways to select 2 balls from \(n-1\) balls is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

We are told that this number is 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:

We need two numbers that multiply to -88 and add to -3. These numbers are -11 and 8.

Thus, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(n - 11)(n + 8) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives:

\[
n - 11 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad n + 8 = 0
\]

Solving these gives:

\[
n = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -8

Since n represents the number of balls, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, \(n = 11\).

   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his work rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Work Completed by Jack:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work he has completed is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The correct answer is not listed among the options, indicating a potential error in the problem or options. However, based on the calculations, the correct number of valid groups is 68. Since this is not an option, we must choose the closest or most reasonable option given the context, which is not possible here. Therefore, the problem may have an error in the options provided.

Given the options, the closest reasonable choice based on typical problem-solving scenarios would be to select the option that might have been intended to represent the correct answer. However, since none of the options match, we must acknowledge the discrepancy.

In conclusion, the correct number of valid groups is 68, but since this is not an option, the problem may contain an error. If forced to choose, we would select the option that seems most plausible given the context, but in this case, none are correct.

A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set S (which contains integers from 1 to 1,000) is relatively prime to 1,000.

First, we find the prime factorization of 1,000:
1,000 = 10^3 = (2 * 5)^3 = 2^3 * 5^3.

A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not share any prime factors with 1,000. Therefore, a number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it is not divisible by 2 or 5.

To find the number of integers in S that are not relatively prime to 1,000, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

1. Count the numbers divisible by 2: There are 500 such numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 1,000).
2. Count the numbers divisible by 5: There are 200 such numbers (5, 10, 15, ..., 1,000).
3. Count the numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10): There are 100 such numbers (10, 20, 30, ..., 1,000).

Using inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers not relatively prime to 1,000 is:
500 (divisible by 2) + 200 (divisible by 5) - 100 (divisible by 10) = 600.

Therefore, the number of integers that are relatively prime to 1,000 is:
1,000 - 600 = 400.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is:
400/1,000 = 2/5.

240,,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money Charles invested, given that he received $54,080 after one year with an 8% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually.

The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8% as a decimal)
- \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P (1.04)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

To find \( P \), divide both sides by 1.0816:

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

Therefore, the original amount of money Charles invested is approximately $50,000.

Let's denote the number as \( x \).

According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of \( x \) is 21. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times x = 21
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times x = 21
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 21 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 84

Therefore, the number is 84.

We are given that x is m percent of 4y. This can be written as:

\[ x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ x = \frac{4my}{100} \]

\[ x = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{my}{25} \]

Now, we need to find m as a percentage of x. This means we need to express m in terms of x and then find what percentage m is of x.

From the equation \( x = \frac{my}{25} \), we can solve for m:

\[ m = \frac{25x}{y} \]

Now, to find m as a percentage of x, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{x}\right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the expression for m:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\frac{25x}{y}}{x}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{25}{y}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{2500}{y} \]

Thus, m is \(\frac{2500}{y}\) percent of x.

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 registered voters),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (in this case, exactly 4 voters who voted),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 90% or 0.9),
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} (0.9)^4 (0.1)^1 \]

First, calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{4! \times 1} = 5 \]

Now, calculate \( (0.9)^4 \):

1. **Identify the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is unfenced and is 10 meters, so either \( L = 10 \) or \( W = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the other dimension using the area:**
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters.
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( W \times 10 = 240 \).

First, calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:

Now, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let's denote these integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

The product of these three consecutive integers is:
\((n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = 2184\).

To find \( n \), we can estimate by taking the cube root of 2184, since the product of three consecutive numbers should be close to the cube of the middle number.

The cube root of 2184 is approximately 13, so let's test the integers around this value.

Try \( n = 13 \):
\((13-1) \times 13 \times (13+1) = 12 \times 13 \times 14 = 2184\).

The distance from home to work is:
Distance = 20 km/h × 0.15 h = 3 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cycle this same distance at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.

Next, let's find Q's rate. If Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, then Q's rate is 1/2 jar per 5 minutes, which simplifies to 1/10 of the jar per minute.

Now, we add their rates together to find the combined rate when they eat simultaneously:
P's rate + Q's rate = 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5 of the jar per minute.

This means together, they can eat 1/5 of the jar in one minute. To find out how many minutes it takes them to finish the entire jar, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:
