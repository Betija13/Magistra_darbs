0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the angle of elevation, the distance from the car to the base of the tower, and the height of the tower. The problem involves trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the opposite side (height of the tower) and the adjacent side (distance from the car to the base of the tower).

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( d_1 \) as the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( d_2 \) as the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know:
1. When the angle of elevation is 45°, \(\tan(45°) = 1\), so \( h = d_1 \).
2. When the angle of elevation is 60°, \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( h = d_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \).

Since \( h = d_1 \) and \( h = d_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \), we can equate these:
\[ d_1 = d_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \]

The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ d_1 - d_2 = d_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} - d_2 = d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

Since the car travels this distance in 10 minutes, the speed \( v \) of the car is:
\[ v = \frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from \( d_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( d_2 \)). The time \( t \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d_2}{v} = \frac{d_2}{\frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \]

The denominator simplifies as follows:
\[ (\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = (\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Thus, the time \( t \) is:
\[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes. The correct answer is:

A) 5(√3 + 1)
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 5(√3 + 1)

To arrive at this conclusion, we used trigonometric relationships and algebraic manipulation to determine the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes from 60° to 0°. By setting up the equations for the tangent of the angles and solving for the time, we found that the car will take an additional \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the item, which we'll denote as \( P \).

1. **Understanding the Discount**: The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( 78\% \) of the original price. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 0.78P
   \]

2. **Applying the Coupon**: After applying the $20-off coupon, the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   \text{Price Paid} = 0.78P - 20
   \]

3. **Relating to Half the Original Price**: According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation**: We need to solve for \( P \).

   - First, eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2(0.78P - 20) = P + 3.8
     \]
     \[
     1.56P - 40 = P + 3.8
     \]

   - Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( P \) on one side:
     \[
     1.56P - P = 3.8 + 40
     \]
     \[
     0.56P = 43.8
     \]

   - Solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 0.56:
     \[
     P = \frac{43.8}{0.56}
     \]
     \[
     P = 78.2142857

Therefore, the original price of the item is \(\boxed{78.20}\).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer for the math word problem, let's go through the reasoning process step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Discount**: The item is originally priced at \( P \). It is discounted by 22%, meaning the customer pays 78% of the original price. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 0.78P
   \]

2. **Applying the Coupon**: The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price. Therefore, the price the customer actually pays is:
   \[
   \text{Price Paid} = 0.78P - 20
   \]

3. **Relating to Half the Original Price**: The problem states that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation**: We need to solve for \( P \).

   - First, eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:

2,,"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?
A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. This means we are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. 

First, let's find the prime factorization of each number:

- 9 can be factored into prime numbers as \(9 = 3^2\).
- 12 can be factored into prime numbers as \(12 = 2^2 \times 3\).

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- For the prime number 2, the highest power is \(2^2\) (from 12).
- For the prime number 3, the highest power is \(3^2\) (from 9).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36\).

Now, we need to check which of the given options is a multiple of this LCM, 36. Let's evaluate each option:

- A) 36: This is exactly the LCM we calculated, so it is a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- B) 15: This is not a multiple of 36, as 36 is not divisible by 15.
- C) 17: This is not a multiple of 36, as 36 is not divisible by 17.
- D) 5: This is not a multiple of 36, as 36 is not divisible by 5.
- E) 7: This is not a multiple of 36, as 36 is not divisible by 7.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) 36, as it is the only number in the list that is a multiple of both 9 and 12.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 36

The reasoning process involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 9 and 12, as the problem asks for a value that is a multiple of both. The LCM is determined by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations of the numbers:

- The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\).
- The prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\).

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).

Thus, the LCM is \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36\).

We then check which of the given options is a multiple of 36:

- A) 36: This is exactly the LCM, so it is a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- B) 15, C) 17, D) 5, and E) 7 are not multiples of 36, as 36 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. 

First, let's define the events:
- Let \( P(A) \) be the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is given as 0.56.
- Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is given as 0.74.

We are interested in finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both events \( A' \) (Stock A does not increase) and \( B' \) (Stock B does not increase) occur.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is:
\[ P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. \]

The probability that Stock B does not increase is:
\[ P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

To find the greatest probability that neither event occurs, we need to consider the scenario where the events are independent. If \( A' \) and \( B' \) are independent, the probability that both \( A' \) and \( B' \) occur is:
\[ P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \times P(B') = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies that we should consider the scenario where the events are not independent and are instead mutually exclusive, which would maximize the probability of neither event occurring.

If \( A' \) and \( B' \) are mutually exclusive, then:
\[ P(A' \cup B') = P(A') + P(B') = 0.44 + 0.26 = 0.70. \]

The probability that neither event occurs is the complement of the probability that at least one event occurs:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - P(A \cup B). \]

To maximize \( P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) \), we minimize \( P(A \cup B) \). The minimum value of \( P(A \cup B) \) occurs when \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive, which is:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.56 + 0.74 = 1.30. \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, the maximum \( P(A \cup B) \) is 1. Therefore, the minimum \( P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) \) is:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - 1 = 0. \]

But this is not possible since we are looking for the greatest value. Therefore, we should consider the scenario where the events are independent, which gives us the greatest possible value for \( P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) \) as calculated earlier:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 0.1144. \]

However, this value does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the scenario where the events are not independent but overlap in such a way that maximizes the probability of neither occurring. 

The greatest value for \( P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) \) is when the events are as independent as possible, which gives us:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)). \]

Since we want to maximize \( P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) \), we minimize \( P(A \cap B) \). The minimum value of \( P(A \cap B) \) is 0, which gives:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.56 + 0.74 = 1.30. \]

Since this exceeds 1, the maximum \( P(A \cup B) \) is 1, and thus:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - 1 = 0. \]

Re-evaluating, the correct approach is to consider the overlap that maximizes the probability of neither occurring, which is:
\[ P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)) = 1 - 1 = 0. \]

The correct answer is the greatest value that can be achieved given the constraints, which is:

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs.360.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding Profit Percentage**: 
   - The article was sold at a 20% profit. This means the selling price (SP) is 120% of the cost price (CP). 
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as: 
     \[
     \text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.20 \times \text{CP} = 1.20 \times \text{CP}
     \]

2. **Given Selling Price**:
   - The selling price (SP) is given as Rs.360.

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - From the relationship between SP and CP, we have:
     \[
     1.20 \times \text{CP} = 360
     \]

4. **Solving for Cost Price (CP)**:
   - To find the cost price, we need to solve the equation for CP:
     \[
     \text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.20}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Cost Price**:
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300
     \]

6. **Verification**:
   - To verify, calculate 20% of Rs.300 and add it to Rs.300 to check if it equals Rs.360:
     \[
     0.20 \times 300 = 60
     \]
     \[
     300 + 60 = 360
     \]
   - The calculation confirms that the selling price is indeed Rs.360 when the cost price is Rs.300.

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300, which corresponds to option (B).

A)74453
B)64543
C)74325
D)65000
E)97656",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using a specific format: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The problem also asks how many letters need to be distinct, but this part seems to be a bit unclear in the context of the choices provided. However, let's focus on calculating the total number of distinct combinations.

1. **Understanding the Format**: 
   - The bike number consists of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.
   - The letters can be any of the 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).
   - The numbers can be any digit from 0 to 9.

2. **Calculating the Combinations**:
   - **Letters**: Since there are 26 letters and we need 2 letters, the number of combinations for the letters is \(26 \times 26\). This is because each letter can be any of the 26 letters, and they do not need to be distinct unless specified otherwise.
   - **Numbers**: For the numbers, since there are 10 possible digits (0-9) and we need 2 numbers, the number of combinations for the numbers is \(10 \times 10\).

3. **Total Combinations**:
   - Multiply the combinations of letters and numbers to get the total number of distinct bike numbers:
   \[
   (26 \times 26) \times (10 \times 10) = 676 \times 100 = 67600
   \]

4. **Matching with the Choices**:
   - The calculated total number of distinct bike numbers is 67600. However, this number does not match any of the given choices directly. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an additional constraint or misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding distinct letters or numbers.

5. **Re-evaluating the Problem**:
   - If the problem implies that the letters need to be distinct, then the calculation for the letters would change:
     - For the first letter, there are 26 options.
     - For the second letter, there would be 25 options (since it must be different from the first).
     - The combinations for the letters would then be \(26 \times 25\).

   - Recalculate with distinct letters:
   \[
   (26 \times 25) \times (10 \times 10) = 650 \times 100 = 65000
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - With the assumption that the letters need to be distinct, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 65000, which matches choice (D).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 65000.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (D) 65000.

Here's the reasoning process broken down:

1. **Understanding the Format**: The bike number format is 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.

2. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - **Letters**: If the letters need to be distinct, the first letter has 26 options, and the second letter has 25 options (since it must be different from the first). Thus, the combinations for the letters are \(26 \times 25\).
   - **Numbers**: Each number can be any digit from 0 to 9, so for two numbers, the combinations are \(10 \times 10\).

3. **Total Combinations**:
   - Multiply the combinations of letters and numbers:
   \[
   (26 \times 25) \times (10 \times 10) = 650 \times 100 = 65000
   \]

7,,"A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total journey duration of the train given the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination. Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Determine the Distance Covered Before the Speed Change:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining. Thus, the distance covered before the speed change is:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Initial Distance:**
   - The time taken to cover the first 250 miles at 100 miles/hour is:
     \[
     \text{Time for 250 miles} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the Remaining Distance:**
   - After covering 250 miles, the remaining distance is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Remaining Distance:**
   - The train covers the remaining 750 miles at a reduced speed of 75 miles/hour. The time taken for this part of the journey is:
     \[
     \text{Time for 750 miles} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Journey Duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the initial 250 miles and the time taken to cover the remaining 750 miles:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total journey duration is 12.5 hours. The correct answer is (C) 12.5.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 12.5.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed a systematic approach to break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Distance:** 
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is 1000 miles.

2. **Determine the Distance Covered Before the Speed Change:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining, which is 250 miles.

3. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Initial Distance:**
   - At 100 miles/hour, it takes 2.5 hours to cover 250 miles.

4. **Determine the Remaining Distance:**
   - After covering 250 miles, the remaining distance is 750 miles.

5. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Remaining Distance:**
   - The train covers the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour, taking 10 hours.

6. **Calculate the Total Journey Duration:**
   - Adding the time for the initial 250 miles (2.5 hours) and the time for the remaining 750 miles (10 hours) gives a total journey duration of 12.5 hours.

8,,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. We are given that there are 200 students in total, and we have the following percentages:

- At least 45% attended the prom night.
- At least 35% took part in the debating session.

First, let's calculate the minimum number of students who attended each event:

1. **Prom Night Attendance:**
   - 45% of 200 students = 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

2. **Debating Session Participation:**
   - 35% of 200 students = 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

To find the maximum number of students who attended neither event, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups. The maximum number of students who attended neither event occurs when the overlap between the two groups is maximized. This means we want to minimize the number of students who attended both events.

Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who attended at least one of the events:

- Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night.
- Let \( D \) be the set of students who participated in the debating session.

The number of students who attended at least one event is given by:

\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]

Where:
- \( |P| = 90 \) (students who attended the prom night)
- \( |D| = 70 \) (students who participated in the debating session)

To maximize the number of students who attended neither event, we want to minimize \( |P \cap D| \). The minimum value for \( |P \cap D| \) is 0, which occurs when there is no overlap between the two groups.

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 0 = 160 \]

This means 160 students attended at least one of the events. Therefore, the number of students who attended neither event is:

\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the overlap:

If we assume the maximum overlap, then all students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night. In this case, the overlap \( |P \cap D| \) would be 70 (since all 70 students who participated in the debating session also attended the prom night).

Recalculate using this overlap:

\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

Thus, the number of students who attended neither event is:

\[ 200 - 90 = 110 \]

This matches option (E). Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:

9,,"A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
A)15
B)24
C)25
D)40
E)52",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sales of $250 each are required for the salesperson to earn at least $1000 in commission.

1. **Understand the Commission Structure**: The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale. This means for each sale of $250, the commission earned is:
   \[
   \text{Commission per sale} = 10\% \times 250 = 0.10 \times 250 = 25
   \]
   So, the salesperson earns $25 for each $250 sale.

2. **Determine the Total Commission Needed**: The problem states that the salesperson wants to earn at least $1000 in commission. Therefore, we need to find out how many $25 commissions are needed to reach $1000.

3. **Set Up the Equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of sales needed. The total commission from \( x \) sales is:
   \[
   25x \geq 1000
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   25x = 1000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1000}{25} = 40
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation**: If the salesperson makes 40 sales, the total commission would be:
   \[
   40 \times 25 = 1000
   \]
   This matches the requirement of earning at least $1000.

6. **Conclusion**: The salesperson must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to earn a commission of at least $1000.

Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{40} \), which corresponds to option (D).

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

First, let's calculate the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:

- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

Next, we find the combined rate of both machines working together:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Converting each rate to have a denominator of 18:

- \( \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18} \)
- \( \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18} \)

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

This means together, the machines produce \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate. We set up the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

Solving for \( t \), we multiply both sides by 18 to clear the fraction:

\[
5t = 180
\]

Then, divide both sides by 5:

\[
t = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Therefore, it will take 36 minutes for the two machines to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

The correct answer is (C) 36 minutes.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 36 minutes.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first determined the individual production rates of the two machines. Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, which translates to a rate of \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute. Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, translating to a rate of \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

Next, we calculated the combined production rate of both machines by adding their individual rates. To do this, we found a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{1}{6} \) and \( \frac{1}{9} \), which is 18. Converting the rates to have this common denominator, we got \( \frac{3}{18} \) for Machine A and \( \frac{2}{18} \) for Machine B. Adding these gives a combined rate of \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

Finally, we set up an equation to find the time \( t \) it takes to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate: \( \frac{5}{18} \times t = 10 \). Solving for \( t \), we multiplied both sides by 18 to eliminate the fraction, resulting in \( 5t = 180 \). Dividing both sides by 5, we found \( t = 36 \).

Thus, the machines together will produce 10 yo-yos in 36 minutes, making the correct answer (C) 36 minutes.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

E)1.5",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability and the independence of events.

The problem asks for \( P(A/B) \), which is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is:

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

However, the problem states that events A and B are independent. For independent events, the probability of both events occurring, \( P(A \cap B) \), is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.8 \)

We can calculate \( P(A \cap B) \) as follows:

\[ P(A \cap B) = 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.16 \]

Now, we can substitute this into the formula for conditional probability:

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.16}{0.8} \]

Performing the division:

\[ P(A/B) = 0.2 \]

Thus, the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is 0.2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 0.2
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 0.2

To determine the correct answer, we used the concept of conditional probability and the property of independent events. The problem provided the probabilities of events A and B, and since they are independent, the probability of both events occurring together, \( P(A \cap B) \), is simply the product of their individual probabilities. We calculated this as \( 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.16 \).

Next, we applied the formula for conditional probability:

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.16}{0.8} \]

By performing the division, we found that \( P(A/B) = 0.2 \).

A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. **Scenario 1**: You walk 20 steps and then stop. You reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. **Scenario 2**: You walk 10 steps and then stop. You reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

**Scenario 1 Analysis:**
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes, which gives us the equation:
  \[
  S - 20 = 10v
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  S = 10v + 20
  \]

**Scenario 2 Analysis:**
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes, which gives us the equation:
  \[
  S - 10 = 20v
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  S = 20v + 10
  \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S = 10v + 20 \)
2. \( S = 20v + 10 \)

Since both expressions equal \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
10v + 20 = 20v + 10
\]

Solving for \( v \):
- Subtract \( 10v \) from both sides:
  \[
  20 = 10v + 10
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  10 = 10v
  \]
- Divide both sides by 10:
  \[
  v = 1
  \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
```
A) 1 step/minute
```
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, let's go through the reasoning process step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a staircase elevator, and we are given two scenarios with different walking steps and times to reach the bottom.
   - We need to find the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

2. **Defining Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

3. **Analyzing Scenario 1:**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - The elevator covers the remaining \( S - 20 \) steps.
   - The total time to reach the bottom is 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes, leading to the equation:
     \[
     S - 20 = 10v
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     S = 10v + 20
     \]

4. **Analyzing Scenario 2:**
   - You walk 10 steps and then stop.
   - The elevator covers the remaining \( S - 10 \) steps.
   - The total time to reach the bottom is 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes, leading to the equation:
     \[
     S - 10 = 20v
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     S = 20v + 10
     \]

5. **Equating the Two Expressions for \( S \):**
   - Since both expressions represent the total number of steps \( S \), we set them equal:
     \[
     10v + 20 = 20v + 10
     \]

6. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - Subtract \( 10v \) from both sides:
     \[
     20 = 10v + 10
     \]
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     10 = 10v
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     v = 1
     \]

E)None of the above",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over a 22-month period, given the sales data for two separate time frames: last year (12 months) and the first 10 months of this year.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month.
   - Therefore, the total number sold last year is:
     \[
     42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for the first 10 months.
   - Therefore, the total number sold in these 10 months is:
     \[
     20 \text{ ovens/month} \times 10 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ ovens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the entire 22-month period:**
   - Add the totals from last year and the first 10 months of this year:
     \[
     504 \text{ ovens} + 200 \text{ ovens} = 704 \text{ ovens}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Divide the total number of ovens sold by the total number of months:
     \[
     \frac{704 \text{ ovens}}{22 \text{ months}} = 32 \text{ ovens/month}
     \]

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. The correct answer is:

**D) 32**

To determine the correct answer, I followed these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales for last year:**
   - The store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sales last year = 42 ovens/month × 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first 10 months of this year:**
   - The store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sales for the first 10 months = 20 ovens/month × 10 months = 200 ovens.

3. **Calculate the total sales over the entire 22-month period:**
   - Combine the sales from last year and the first 10 months of this year.
   - Total sales over 22 months = 504 ovens + 200 ovens = 704 ovens.

4. **Calculate the average sales per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Divide the total sales by the total number of months.
   - Average sales per month = 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.

By following these calculations, I determined that the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. Therefore, the correct answer is option **D) 32**.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Definitions and Given Information:**
   - Let \( H \) be the highest score and \( L \) be the lowest score.
   - The average of the highest and lowest scores is given by:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x
     \]
     Therefore, \( H + L = 2x \).

   - The average score for the entire class is \( y \), and there are \( z \) students. Thus, the total score for the class is:
     \[
     zy
     \]

2. **Excluding the Highest and Lowest Scores:**
   - If we exclude the highest and lowest scores, we are left with \( z - 2 \) students.
   - The total score of the remaining \( z - 2 \) students is the total score of the class minus the highest and lowest scores:
     \[
     \text{Total score of remaining students} = zy - (H + L)
     \]

3. **Substitute \( H + L \):**
   - We know \( H + L = 2x \), so:

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6
\]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Simplify the Denominator:**

   The denominator of the fraction is:
   \[
   13 \times 13 - 156
   \]

   Calculate \(13 \times 13\):
   \[
   13 \times 13 = 169
   \]

   Subtract 156 from 169:
   \[
   169 - 156 = 13
   \]

   So, the denominator simplifies to 13.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**

   Now, substitute the simplified denominator back into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6
   \]

3. **Clear the Fraction:**

   Multiply both sides of the equation by 13 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 \times 13
   \]

   Calculate \(6 \times 13\):
   \[
   6 \times 13 = 78
   \]

   So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 78
   \]

4. **Simplify the Left Side:**

   Combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   5 - 15 - 7 = -17
   \]

   So, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   ? \times 19 - 17 = 78
   \]

5. **Solve for ?:**

   Add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the question mark:
   \[
   ? \times 19 = 78 + 17
   \]

   Calculate \(78 + 17\):
   \[
   78 + 17 = 95
   \]

   So, we have:
   \[
   ? \times 19 = 95
   \]

   Divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?:
   \[
   ? = \frac{95}{19}

20,,"A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?
A)12
B)16
C)24
D)30
E)40",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's understand what a 25% profit on the selling price means. If the selling price of each bag is $100, then the profit per bag is 25% of $100. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

This means the grocer makes a $25 profit for each bag sold.

Next, we need to find out how many bags were sold to achieve a total profit of $3,000. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Total profit} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold. Then:

\[ x \times 25 = 3000 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{3000}{25} \]

\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour to make a $3,000 profit.

However, the options provided are much smaller numbers, which suggests a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The profit is calculated based on the selling price, not the cost price. The problem states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the profit is 25% of $100 per bag. We already calculated that the profit per bag is $25.

Now, let's check the options again. The calculation of 120 bags is correct based on the profit per bag, but it seems there might be a misinterpretation of the options or the problem statement. The options provided do not match the calculated number of bags, which suggests a possible error in the problem setup or options.

Given the options, none of them match the calculated 120 bags. However, based on the problem statement and the calculation, the correct number of bags sold to achieve a $3,000 profit, with a $25 profit per bag, is indeed 120. The options provided do not align with this calculation, indicating a potential error in the options list.

Therefore, based on the correct calculation, the grocer sold 120 bags, but this is not reflected in the given options.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Upon reviewing the problem and the calculations, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the options. Let's go through the problem again to ensure clarity.

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100. Therefore, the profit per bag is:

\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

The total profit made is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we use the equation:

\[ \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Total profit} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold. Then:

\[ x \times 25 = 3000 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3000}{25} = 120 \]

The calculation shows that 120 bags were sold to make a $3,000 profit. However, the options provided do not include 120, which suggests a potential error in the options or a misinterpretation of the problem.

C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The time Alex spent making toys is \( 7A \) hours (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The time Jacob spent making toys is \( 9J \) hours (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both of them worked for almost the same number of hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can assume:
\[ 7A = 9J \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \)
2. \( 7A = 9J \)

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ A = \frac{9}{7}J \]

Substitute this expression for \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + J = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + \frac{7}{7}J = 35 \]

\[ \frac{16}{7}J = 35 \]

To solve for \( J \), multiply both sides by 7:
\[ 16J = 35 \times 7 \]

\[ 16J = 245 \]

Now, divide both sides by 16 to find \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{245}{16} \]

\[ J = 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number (as you can't make a fraction of a toy), we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
A)15.38%
B)42%
C)39.86%
D)22.35%
E)32.51%",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to track the concentration of tea in the solution as John makes his replacements with milk.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea solution is 50% strong milk tea. This means that 50% of the solution is tea, and the remaining 50% is milk.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - Initially, the solution is 100% (let's assume 100 units for simplicity), with 50 units of tea and 50 units of milk.
   - He removes 15% of the solution, which is 15 units. Since the solution is uniform, 15% of the tea and 15% of the milk are removed.
   - Tea removed = 15% of 50 = 7.5 units.
   - Milk removed = 15% of 50 = 7.5 units.
   - After removal, tea = 50 - 7.5 = 42.5 units, milk = 50 - 7.5 = 42.5 units.
   - He adds 15 units of milk back, so the new milk amount = 42.5 + 15 = 57.5 units.
   - Total solution = 42.5 (tea) + 57.5 (milk) = 100 units.
   - New concentration of tea = (42.5/100) * 100% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, he replaces 15% of the solution with milk.
   - 15% of the current solution (100 units) is 15 units.
   - Tea removed = 15% of 42.5 = 6.375 units.
   - Milk removed = 15% of 57.5 = 8.625 units.
   - After removal, tea = 42.5 - 6.375 = 36.125 units, milk = 57.5 - 8.625 = 48.875 units.
   - He adds 15 units of milk back, so the new milk amount = 48.875 + 15 = 63.875 units.
   - Total solution = 36.125 (tea) + 63.875 (milk) = 100 units.
   - New concentration of tea = (36.125/100) * 100% = 36.125%.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - He replaces 10% of the solution with milk.
   - 10% of the current solution (100 units) is 10 units.
   - Tea removed = 10% of 36.125 = 3.6125 units.
   - Milk removed = 10% of 63.875 = 6.3875 units.
   - After removal, tea = 36.125 - 3.6125 = 32.5125 units, milk = 63.875 - 6.3875 = 57.4875 units.
   - He adds 10 units of milk back, so the new milk amount = 57.4875 + 10 = 67.4875 units.
   - Total solution = 32.5125 (tea) + 67.4875 (milk) = 100 units.
   - New concentration of tea = (32.5125/100) * 100% = 32.5125%.

The final concentration of tea in the solution is approximately 32.51%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 32.51%.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (E) 32.51%.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed a systematic approach to track the concentration of tea in the solution as John made each replacement with milk. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Initial Concentration:** The solution starts as 50% tea and 50% milk.

2. **First Replacement:** 
   - 15% of the solution is replaced with milk.
   - This reduces the tea concentration to 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Another 15% of the solution is replaced with milk.
   - This further reduces the tea concentration to 36.125%.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - 10% of the solution is replaced with milk.
   - This results in a final tea concentration of approximately 32.5125%.

The calculations at each step involved removing a percentage of the solution, calculating the amount of tea and milk removed, and then adding back the same amount of milk to maintain the total volume. The final concentration of tea was calculated as a percentage of the total solution, leading to the answer (E) 32.51%.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

   - The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
   - The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
   - The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

   The LCM is determined by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:
   - For 2, the highest power is \( 2^4 \).
   - For 5, the highest power is \( 5^1 \).

   Therefore, the LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 80 \).

3. **Determining the range for \( N \):**
   Since \( N \) must be a 4-digit number, it must satisfy \( 1000 \leq N < 10000 \).

4. **Finding the minimum \( N \):**
   The smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is found by dividing 1000 by 80 and rounding up to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{80} = 12.5
   \]
   Rounding up gives 13. Therefore, the smallest \( N \) is:
   \[
   13 \times 80 = 1040
   \]

5. **Finding the maximum \( N \):**

   - This 40% markup resulted in a gross profit of $20.00.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of the appliance.
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost, which can be expressed as \( C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).
   - The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is given as $20.00. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     1.4C - C = 20
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation gives:
     \[
     0.4C = 20

26,,"At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
A)750
B)700
C)620
D)600
E)None of these",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest on the borrowed amount.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money borrowed or invested),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years.

In this problem:
- \( P = 500 \) (the amount Rahul borrowed),
- \( R = 6\% \) per annum,
- \( T = 4 \) years.

Substituting these values into the simple interest formula gives:

\[ \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. Multiply the principal amount by the rate and the time:
   \[ 500 \times 6 \times 4 = 12000 \]

2. Divide the result by 100 to find the simple interest:
   \[ \frac{12000}{100} = 120 \]

So, the simple interest for 4 years is Rs. 120.

To find the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{SI} = 500 + 120 = 620 \]

Therefore, the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years is Rs. 620.

Looking at the choices provided:

   - Principal amount (\( P \)) = Rs. 500
   - Rate of interest (\( R \)) = 6% per annum
   - Time period (\( T \)) = 4 years

2. **Apply the simple interest formula**:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]

3. **Substitute the values into the formula**:
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100}
   \]

4. **Calculate the intermediate steps**:
   - Multiply the principal, rate, and time: \( 500 \times 6 \times 4 = 12000 \)
   - Divide by 100 to find the simple interest: \( \frac{12000}{100} = 120 \)

5. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**:
   - Add the simple interest to the principal: \( 500 + 120 = 620 \)

A)(99,10)
B)(85,9)
C)(50,7)
D)(1,1)
E)(1,0)",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate each pair of numbers (x, y) given in the options and determine if they satisfy the conditions of the computer routine. The conditions are:

1. The first number, x, must be a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive.
2. The second number, y, must be less than or equal to the square root of the first number, x.

Let's analyze each option:

**Option A: (99, 10)**
- x = 99, which is within the range 0 to 100.
- The square root of 99 is approximately 9.95.
- y = 10, which is greater than 9.95.
- Therefore, this pair does not satisfy the condition that y must be less than or equal to the square root of x.

**Option B: (85, 9)**
- x = 85, which is within the range 0 to 100.
- The square root of 85 is approximately 9.22.
- y = 9, which is less than 9.22.
- This pair satisfies the condition.

**Option C: (50, 7)**
- x = 50, which is within the range 0 to 100.
- The square root of 50 is approximately 7.07.
- y = 7, which is less than 7.07.
- This pair satisfies the condition.

**Option D: (1, 1)**
- x = 1, which is within the range 0 to 100.
- The square root of 1 is 1.
- y = 1, which is equal to 1.
- This pair satisfies the condition.

**Option E: (1, 0)**
- x = 1, which is within the range 0 to 100.
- The square root of 1 is 1.
- y = 0, which is less than 1.
- This pair satisfies the condition.

After evaluating all the options, we find that option A (99, 10) is the only pair that does not satisfy the condition that y must be less than or equal to the square root of x. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(A) (99, 10)**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) (99, 10)

The reasoning process involves checking each pair of numbers against the conditions specified by the computer routine. For each pair, we verify that the first number, x, is within the range of 0 to 100, and then we calculate the square root of x to ensure that the second number, y, is less than or equal to this square root. 

In option A, the first number is 99, which is within the specified range. However, the square root of 99 is approximately 9.95, and the second number is 10, which is greater than 9.95. This violates the condition that y must be less than or equal to the square root of x, making option A the only pair that does not satisfy the routine's conditions.

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. We are given two scenarios: the forward journey and the return journey.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (which is the same for both forward and return journeys).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey in km/hr.

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Speed = \( v \) km/hr
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( v \times 6 = 6v \)

3. **Return Journey:**
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Speed = \( v + 12 \) km/hr (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr)
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( (v + 12) \times 4 = 4v + 48 \)

4. **Set the Distances Equal:**
   Since the distance for both journeys is the same, we equate the two expressions for distance:
   \[
   6v = 4v + 48
   \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**
   - Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:
     \[
     6v - 4v = 48

     \]

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. The correct answer is:

**B) 144km**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: **B) 144km**

Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep.
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey in km/hr.

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - The jeep takes 6 hours to travel the distance \( d \).
   - Therefore, the speed during the forward journey is \( v \) km/hr.
   - The distance can be expressed as: 
     \[
     d = v \times 6
     \]

3. **Return Journey:**
   - The jeep takes 4 hours to travel the same distance \( d \) on the return journey.
   - The speed during the return journey is \( v + 12 \) km/hr (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr).
   - The distance can be expressed as:
     \[
     d = (v + 12) \times 4
     \]

4. **Set the Distances Equal:**
   Since the distance \( d \) is the same for both journeys, we equate the two expressions:
   \[
   6v = 4(v + 12)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**
   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     6v = 4v + 48
     \]
   - Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( v \):
     \[
     6v - 4v = 48
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2v = 48
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = 24
     \]

6. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - Substitute \( v = 24 \) back into the expression for distance:
     \[
     d = 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144

     \[
     S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W
     \]

4. **Determine the Percent Increase Over Wholesale Cost:**
   - The selling price \( S \) is \( 1.28W \), which means it is 28% more than the wholesale cost \( W \).
   - To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{S - W}{W}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 1.28W \):
     \[
     \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{1.28W - W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{0.28W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = 28\%

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of folding a rectangular sheet into two equal halves and how it affects the perimeter.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each half will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 48 cm.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Therefore, for the folded part: 
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each half will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, for the folded part:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

**Step 1: Solve for one variable.**

From Equation 1:
\[ l = 48 - 2w \]

**Step 2: Substitute into Equation 2.**

Substitute \( l = 48 - 2w \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2w) + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4w + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3w = 66 \]
\[ 3w = 96 - 66 \]
\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

**Step 3: Find \( l \).**

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[ l = 48 - 2(10) \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the area of the sheet.**

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]
\[ A = 28 \times 10 \]
\[ A = 280 \]

It seems there is a mistake in the calculation or interpretation, as the area calculated does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Upon re-evaluation, it seems there was a misinterpretation of the folding process. Let's correct this:

1. **Re-evaluate the folding process:**

   - When folded along the length, the perimeter of the folded part is 48 cm:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48 \implies l + 2w = 48
     \]

   - When folded along the width, the perimeter of the folded part is 66 cm:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66 \implies 2l + w = 66
     \]

2. **Re-solve the equations:**

   - From \( l + 2w = 48 \), we have \( l = 48 - 2w \).
   - Substitute into \( 2l + w = 66 \):
     \[
     2(48 - 2w) + w = 66
     \]
     \[
     96 - 4w + w = 66
     \]
     \[
     96 - 3w = 66
     \]
     \[
     3w = 30
     \]
     \[
     w = 10

   - Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into \( l = 48 - 2w \):
     \[
     l = 48 - 2(10) = 28
     \]

3. **Re-calculate the area:**

   - The area \( A \) is:

\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

**Step 3: Find \( l \).**

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[ l = 48 - 2(10) \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the area of the sheet.**

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:

33,,"Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
A)24
B)36
C)72
D)84
E)None",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of ways to travel from place M to place Q, given the number of bus options available between each pair of consecutive places.

The journey from M to Q involves traveling through the intermediate places N, O, and P. We can break down the journey into segments and calculate the number of ways to travel each segment:

1. **From M to N:** There are 3 different buses available. Therefore, there are 3 ways to travel from M to N.

2. **From N to O:** There are 4 different buses available. Therefore, there are 4 ways to travel from N to O.

3. **From O to P:** There is only 1 bus available. Therefore, there is only 1 way to travel from O to P.

4. **From P to Q:** There are 3 different buses available. Therefore, there are 3 ways to travel from P to Q.

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways to travel each segment together. This is because for each way to travel one segment, there are multiple ways to travel the next segment, and so on.

The total number of ways is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total ways} = (\text{ways from M to N}) \times (\text{ways from N to O}) \times (\text{ways from O to P}) \times (\text{ways from P to Q})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total ways} = 3 \times 4 \times 1 \times 3
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\]
\[
12 \times 1 = 12
\]
\[
12 \times 3 = 36
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 36.

The correct answer is (B) 36.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 36.

To determine the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the number of bus options available for each segment of the journey and multiply them together. This is because each choice of bus for one segment can be combined with each choice of bus for the next segment, resulting in a multiplication of options.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **From M to N:** There are 3 buses available, so there are 3 ways to travel this segment.
2. **From N to O:** There are 4 buses available, so there are 4 ways to travel this segment.
3. **From O to P:** There is 1 bus available, so there is only 1 way to travel this segment.
4. **From P to Q:** There are 3 buses available, so there are 3 ways to travel this segment.

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each segment:

\[
\text{Total ways} = 3 \times 4 \times 1 \times 3
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, multiply the ways from M to N and N to O: \(3 \times 4 = 12\).
- Then, multiply by the ways from O to P: \(12 \times 1 = 12\).
- Finally, multiply by the ways from P to Q: \(12 \times 3 = 36\).

Thus, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 36, which corresponds to option (B).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: 
   - The rectangular solid is a 3D shape with dimensions 3, 4, and 15.
   - When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid. This is because the diagonal is the longest line that can be drawn within the solid, and it will pass through the center of the sphere, touching the sphere at two opposite vertices of the solid.

2. **Calculating the Diagonal of the Rectangular Solid**:
   - The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
     \]
   - For our rectangular solid, the dimensions are \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 15\).

3. **Substitute the Dimensions into the Formula**:
   - Calculate the square of each dimension:
     \[
     3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
     \]
   - Sum these squares:
     \[
     9 + 16 + 225 = 250
     \]
   - Take the square root of the sum to find the diagonal:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{250}
     \]

4. **Simplify the Square Root**:
   - Calculate \(\sqrt{250}\):
     \[
     \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5 \times \sqrt{10}

4. **Calculate the Diagonal**: Take the square root of the sum to find the diagonal:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{250}
   \]

D)5km
E)6km",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to track A's movements on a coordinate plane, starting from the origin point, which we'll consider as A's home.

1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume A starts at the origin, which is point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement (South 3 km)**: 
   - Moving south means moving in the negative y-direction.
   - New position: (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement (East 5 km)**:
   - Moving east means moving in the positive x-direction.
   - New position: (5, -3).

4. **Third Movement (North 3 km)**:
   - Moving north means moving in the positive y-direction.
   - New position: (5, 0).

5. **Fourth Movement (West 2 km)**:
   - Moving west means moving in the negative x-direction.
   - New position: (3, 0).

Now, we need to calculate the distance from A's final position (3, 0) back to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on a coordinate plane is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

Substituting the coordinates of the final position and the origin:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3

     \frac{7}{x} \left( \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{18} \right) = 770
     \]
   - Find a common denominator for \( \frac{1}{8} \) and \( \frac{1}{18} \), which is 72:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} = \frac{9}{72}, \quad \frac{1}{18} = \frac{4}{72}
     \]
   - Subtract the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9}{72} - \frac{4}{72} = \frac{5}{72}
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{7}{x} \times \frac{5}{72} = 770
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{35}{72}x = 770
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 72 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     35x = 770 \times 72
     \]
   - Calculate \( 770 \times 72 \):
     \[
     770 \times 72 = 55440
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 35 to solve for \( x \):

38,,"The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. The salary structure is given as a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of the monthly sales.

Let's denote the monthly sales as \( x \).

The total monthly salary \( S \) can be expressed as:
\[ S = 500 + 0.05x \]

We want the salary \( S \) to be $1500, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05x \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 500 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05x \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.05:
\[ x = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

Calculating the division:
\[ x = 1000 \div 0.05 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500.

Now, let's check the options provided:
- A) $50000
- B) $40000
- C) $30000
- D) $20000
- E) None of these

The correct answer is option D) $20000.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: D) $20000.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed these steps:

1. **Understand the Salary Structure**: The shop assistant's salary is composed of a fixed part ($500) and a variable part (5% of monthly sales).

2. **Set Up the Equation**: The total salary \( S \) is given by:
   \[
   S = 500 + 0.05x
   \]
   where \( x \) is the monthly sales.

3. **Target Salary**: We want the salary to be $1500, so we set:
   \[
   1500 = 500 + 0.05x
   \]

4. **Isolate the Variable**: Subtract $500 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   1500 - 500 = 0.05x
   \]
   \[
   1000 = 0.05x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1000}{0.05}
   \]

6. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division:
   \[
   x = 1000 \div 0.05 = 20000

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the average speed of the airplane as it flies around the four sides of a square, each at different speeds. The average speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The airplane flies along the four sides of a square.
   - The speeds for each side are 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.

2. **Assumptions:**
   - Let the length of each side of the square be \( d \). Therefore, the total distance traveled is \( 4d \).

3. **Calculate the Time Taken for Each Side:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr: \( \frac{d}{200} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr: \( \frac{d}{400} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the third side at 600 km/hr: \( \frac{d}{600} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr: \( \frac{d}{800} \) hours.

4. **Total Time Taken:**
   - Total time \( T \) is the sum of the times for each side:
   \[
   T = \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Total Time Expression:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 2400.
   - Convert each fraction:
     \[
     \frac{d}{200} = \frac{12d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{400} = \frac{6d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{600} = \frac{4d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{800} = \frac{3d}{2400}
     \]
   - Sum these fractions:
     \[
     T = \frac{12d + 6d + 4d + 3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - The average speed \( V \) is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   V = \frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}} = \frac{4d \times 2400}{25d} = \frac{9600}{25} = 384 \text{ km/hr}
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the airplane around the field is 384 km/hr.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 384.

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( w \) as the number of white sharpeners.
- \( b \) as the number of brown sharpeners.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of sharpeners is 18:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we can write the equation for the total cost as:
   \[
   w(x + 1) + bx = 100
   \]

Substituting \( w = 18 - b \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
   \[
   (18 - b)(x + 1) + bx = 100
   \]

Expanding this equation:
   \[
   (18 - b)x + (18 - b) + bx = 100
   \]

Simplifying:
   \[
   18x - bx + 18 - b + bx = 100
   \]

The \( bx \) terms cancel out:
   \[
   18x + 18 - b = 100
   \]

Rearranging gives:
   \[
   18x - b = 82
   \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( w + b = 18 \)
2. \( 18x - b = 82 \)

We need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) that satisfy both equations. Let's solve for \( b \) in terms of \( x \) from the second equation:
   \[
   b = 18x - 82
   \]

Substitute \( b = 18 - w \) from the first equation into this:
   \[
   18 - w = 18x - 82
   \]

Rearranging gives:
   \[
   w = 100 - 18x
   \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) such that both \( w \) and \( b \) are non-negative integers. Let's test the options:

- If \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  w = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 100 - 90 = 10
  \]
  \[
  b = 18 - w = 18 - 10 = 8

This gives us \( w = 10 \) and \( b = 8 \), which matches option (A).

     \]

   - Rearrange to find:
     \[
     18x - b = 82
     \]

4. **Solve for Integer Solutions:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( w + b = 18 \)
     2. \( 18x - b = 82 \)

   - Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     b = 18x - 82

     \]

   - Rearrange to find:

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then use that information to find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool on its own.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining portion of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is the combined rate minus the rate of hose A:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Thus, hose B also fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool on its own.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) 8.

The reasoning process involves calculating the rates at which hoses A and B fill the pool and using these rates to determine how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Rate of Hose A:** Hose A fills the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Portion Filled by Hose A in 2 Hours:** In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Remaining Pool to be Filled:** After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains.

4. **Combined Rate of Hoses A and B:** Together, they fill \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours, so their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Rate of Hose B:** The rate of hose B is the combined rate minus the rate of hose A:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]
   Thus, hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Time for Hose B Alone:** Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Appending a 1 to \( N \):**  
   When we append a 1 to the number \( N \), the new number becomes \( 10N + 1 \).

2. **Prepending a 1 to \( N \):**  
   When we prepend a 1 to the number \( N \), the new number becomes \( 100000 + N \).

According to the problem, appending a 1 makes the number three times as large as prepending a 1:

\[
10N + 1 = 3(100000 + N)

1. 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
2. 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team.
- \( C \) as the percentage of all students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team, which is given as 24%.

From the second piece of information, we know that 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This implies that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club.

Since 80% of the swim team members are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and we know that this group (members of both) constitutes 24% of all students, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.8S = 24\% \]

To find \( S \), the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team, we solve the equation:

\[ S = \frac{24\%}{0.8} \]

A)30000
B)415000
C)31500
D)50000
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must achieve to reach a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees, given his fixed salary and commission rate.

1. **Identify the fixed salary and desired total income:**
   - The servant's fixed monthly salary is 1500 Rupees.
   - The desired total monthly income is 6000 Rupees.

2. **Calculate the required income from commission:**
   - The total income needed from both salary and commission is 6000 Rupees.
   - Since the fixed salary is 1500 Rupees, the income needed from commission is:
     \[
     6000 - 1500 = 4500 \text{ Rupees}
     \]

3. **Determine the commission rate and calculate the required sales:**
   - The commission rate is 15% of the monthly sales.
   - Let \( x \) be the required sales in Rupees.
   - The commission earned from sales is \( 0.15 \times x \).
   - We set up the equation for the commission to equal the required commission income:
     \[
     0.15 \times x = 4500
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:
     \[
     x = \frac{4500}{0.15}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 30000
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - If the sales are 30000 Rupees, the commission would be:
     \[
     0.15 \times 30000 = 4500 \text{ Rupees}
     \]
   - Adding the fixed salary:
     \[
     1500 + 4500 = 6000 \text{ Rupees}

A)1.5%
B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount of Rs.360, given that the man pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 12 \times 31.50 = 378
\]

The man borrowed Rs.360 and paid back Rs.378, so the total interest paid is:

\[
\text{Total interest} = 378 - 360 = 18
\]

Next, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to determine the annual interest rate that would result in Rs.18 interest over the course of one year.

The formula for simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Interest is Rs.18
- Principal is Rs.360
- Time is 1 year

We need to solve for the Rate:

\[
18 = 360 \times \text{Rate} \times 1
\]

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{18}{360}
\]

\[
\text{Rate} = 0.05
\]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Rate} = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%
\]

Therefore, the interest rate is 5%. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D) 5\%}
\]
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, let's go through the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   The man pays Rs.31.50 each month for 12 months. Therefore, the total amount paid is:
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 12 \times 31.50 = 378
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Interest Paid:**
   The man originally borrowed Rs.360. The total amount he paid back is Rs.378. Thus, the total interest paid is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 378 - 360 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the Interest Rate:**
   We need to find the annual interest rate that results in Rs.18 interest over one year. Using the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   where:
   - Interest = Rs.18
   - Principal = Rs.360
   - Time = 1 year

A)41.86%
B)42.86%
C)43.86%
D)44.86%
E)45.86%",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between percentage decrease and the subsequent percentage increase required to return to the original value.

1. **Understanding the Initial Reduction:**
   - The product's price is reduced by 30%. This means the new price is 70% of the original price. If we denote the original price as \( P \), the reduced price is \( 0.7P \).

2. **Finding the Required Increase:**
   - We need to determine the percentage increase required to bring the price back to the original price \( P \) from the reduced price \( 0.7P \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the percentage increase needed. The increased price should be equal to the original price:
     \[
     0.7P \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = P
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     0.7P + 0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = P
     \]
   - Subtract \( 0.7P \) from both sides:
     \[
     0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = P - 0.7P
     \]
     \[
     0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = 0.3P
     \]
   - Divide both sides by \( 0.7P \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{100} = \frac{0.3P}{0.7P}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{x}{100} = \frac{0.3}{0.7}
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{x}{100} = \frac{3}{7}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 100 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3}{7} \times 100
     \]
     \[
     x = 42.8571\ldots

56,,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how the painting affects the smaller cubes.

1. **Understanding the Hollow Cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the outer layer of the cube is 1 cm thick, and the inner part is hollow.
   - The inner cube, which is not hollow, will have a size of 3 cm (since 5 cm - 2*1 cm = 3 cm).

2. **Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The entire cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - The outer cube (5 cm) consists of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) consists of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Cubes in the Hollow Part:**
   - Since the cube is hollow, the 27 smaller cubes in the center are not present.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface of the cube is painted, only the outer layer of smaller cubes is affected.
   - The outer layer consists of the cubes that are on the surface of the 5 cm cube.

5. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The total number of faces for all 98 smaller cubes is \(98 \times 6 = 588\).

6. **Painted Faces:**
   - The outer surface of the 5 cm cube is painted, which means the outermost layer of cubes has their outer faces painted.
   - The outer surface area of the 5 cm cube is \(6 \times (5 \times 5) = 150\) square cm.
   - Since each face of a smaller cube is 1 square cm, 150 faces are painted.

7. **Unpainted Faces:**
   - The number of unpainted faces is the total number of faces minus the painted faces.
   - Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is \(588 - 150 = 438\).

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 438.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) 438.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first analyzed the structure of the hollow cube and determined the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube. We calculated the total number of faces for these smaller cubes and subtracted the number of faces that were painted on the outer surface. This gave us the number of unpainted faces, which is 438.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)25 days
B)26 days
C)27 days
D)28 days
E)29 days",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the frog to climb out of a 30-meter deep well, given that it climbs 3 meters up each day but slips back 2 meters each night.

Let's break down the frog's progress:

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog effectively climbs 1 meter (3 meters up during the day minus 2 meters down at night).

2. **Final Day**: On the final day, the frog will not slip back because it will have reached or exceeded the top of the well.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The frog needs to reach a height of 30 meters to get out of the well.
   - If the frog climbs 1 meter per day, it will take 27 days to reach 27 meters (since 27 meters is the last point where it will slip back).
   - On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters up from 27 meters, reaching 30 meters, and will not slip back because it has exited the well.

Therefore, the frog will take 28 days to climb out of the well.

The correct answer is (D) 28 days.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (D) 28 days.

To arrive at this conclusion, we need to consider the frog's net progress each day and the point at which it will finally exit the well. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Daily Net Progress**: Each day, the frog climbs 3 meters up but slips back 2 meters at night. This results in a net gain of 1 meter per day.

2. **Approaching the Exit**: The frog needs to reach a height of 30 meters to exit the well. However, we must consider that on the final day, the frog will not slip back if it reaches or exceeds the top of the well.

3. **Days Calculation**:
   - For the first 27 days, the frog will make a net progress of 1 meter per day, reaching a height of 27 meters by the end of the 27th day.
   - On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters up from 27 meters, reaching a height of 30 meters. Since this is the top of the well, the frog will exit and not slip back.

Thus, the frog will take a total of 28 days to climb out of the well. The correct answer is (D) 28 days.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
59,,"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find a set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. We then need to determine which of the given options could be one of these numbers.

Let's denote the first of these 5 consecutive odd numbers as \( n \). The next four consecutive odd numbers would then be \( n+2 \), \( n+4 \), \( n+6 \), and \( n+8 \).

The sum of these 5 numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

We are given that this sum, when divided by 10, should be a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This expression, \(\frac{n + 4}{2}\), must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as \( k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Thus:
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \]
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, it must satisfy:
1. \( 10 \leq n \leq 99 \)
2. \( n \) is odd

Let's find the range of \( k \) that satisfies these conditions:
- For the lower bound: \( 10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \)
  \[ 2k^2 \geq 14 \]
  \[ k^2 \geq 7 \]
  \[ k \geq \sqrt{7} \approx 2.65 \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, \( k \geq 3 \).

- For the upper bound: \( 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99 \)
  \[ 2k^2 \leq 103 \]
  \[ k^2 \leq 51.5 \]
  \[ k \leq \sqrt{51.5} \approx 7.18 \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, \( k \leq 7 \).

Thus, \( k \) can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Let's calculate \( n \) for each possible \( k \):
- \( k = 3 \): \( n = 2(3^2) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) (not odd)
- \( k = 4 \): \( n = 2(4^2) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \) (not odd)
- \( k = 5 \): \( n = 2(5^2) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \) (not odd)
- \( k = 6 \): \( n = 2(6^2) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \) (not odd)
- \( k = 7 \): \( n = 2(7^2) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \) (not odd)

None of these values of \( n \) are odd, which suggests a mistake in the calculation or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the condition for odd numbers:

Since \( n \) must be odd, we should have:
\[ 2k^2 - 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \]
\[ 2k^2 \equiv 5 \pmod{2} \]
This is not possible since \( 2k^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \).

Re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the condition should be:
\[ n = 2k^2 - 3 \]
This ensures \( n \) is odd.

Re-calculating for \( k = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \):
- \( k = 3 \): \( n = 2(3^2) - 3 = 18 - 3 = 15 \) (odd)
- \( k = 4 \): \( n = 2(4^2) - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29 \) (odd)

- \( k = 7 \): \( n = 2(7^2) - 3 = 98 - 3 = 95 \) (odd)

A)850
B)800
C)900
D)950
E)1000",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the class. We are given percentages of students interested in different sports and the number of students not interested in any games.

Let's denote the total number of students in the class as \( x \).

1. **Football Interest**: 8% of the students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).

2. **Cricket Interest**: 4/5 of the students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).

3. **Basketball Interest**: 10% of the students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

4. **Not Interested in Any Games**: We are told that 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of all these groups should equal the total number of students, \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

First, convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal to make calculations easier:

\[
\frac{4}{5} = 0.80
\]

Now substitute back into the equation:

\[
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
(0.08 + 0.80 + 0.10)x + 20 = x
\]

\[
0.98x + 20 = x
\]

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides to isolate the constant:

\[
20 = x - 0.98x
\]

\[
20 = 0.02x
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.02:

\[
x = \frac{20}{0.02}
\]

\[
x = 1000

Thus, the total number of students in the class is 1000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E) 1000

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed these steps:

1. **Identify the variables and given data**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of students.
   - 8% of students are interested in Football: \( 0.08x \).
   - 4/5 of students are interested in Cricket: \( \frac{4}{5}x = 0.80x \).
   - 10% of students are interested in Basketball: \( 0.10x \).
   - 20 students are not interested in any games.

2. **Set up the equation**: 
   - The sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, and those not interested in any games should equal the total number of students, \( x \).

3. **Formulate the equation**:
   \[
   0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Combine the terms involving \( x \):
   \[
   0.98x + 20 = x
   \]

5. **Isolate the constant**:
   - Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:
   \[
   20 = x - 0.98x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Simplify the right side:
   \[
   20 = 0.02x
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.02:
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000

This equation tells us that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.

We can rearrange the equation to find a relationship between the ages:
\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r + t = 2q \]

The problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we find:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R's age and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \), we know:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

And from \( r + t = 2q \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms that our equations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[ r + t = 50 \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

This doesn't directly give us \( r - q \) without additional information about individual ages of R and T. However, we can use the equation \( r - q = q - t \) to express \( r \) in terms of \( q \) and \( t \):
\[ r = 2q - t \]

Substituting \( q = 25 \) into the equation:
\[ r = 2 \times 25 - t = 50 - t \]

Now, we substitute back into the equation \( r + t = 50 \):
\[ (50 - t) + t = 50 \]

This equation is always true, but it doesn't help us find a specific value for \( r - q \) without knowing \( t \).

Therefore, the difference between R's age and Q's age cannot be determined with the given information alone. The correct answer is:

A)11.75 miles
B)12.75 miles
C)17.75 miles
D)14.75 miles
E)10.75 miles",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how far you can travel in a cab with $8.50, given the cab's pricing structure. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.

1. **Initial Cost for the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - The first quarter-mile costs $3.50. This is a fixed cost that must be paid regardless of how far you travel beyond the first quarter-mile.

2. **Remaining Money After the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - After paying $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left to spend on additional distance.

3. **Cost for Additional Distance:**
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents ($0.10).

4. **Calculate the Number of Additional Quarter-Miles:**
   - With $5.00 remaining, you can afford $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

5. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - The total distance traveled includes the first quarter-mile plus the additional quarter-miles.
   - The first quarter-mile is 0.25 miles.
   - The additional 50 quarter-miles amount to 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.

6. **Total Distance:**
   - Add the first quarter-mile to the additional distance: 0.25 miles + 12.5 miles = 12.75 miles.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

The correct answer is **B) 12.75 miles**.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: B) 12.75 miles.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Initial Cost for the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - The cab charges a flat rate of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. This is a mandatory cost that must be deducted from the total amount of money available, which is $8.50.

2. **Remaining Money After the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - After paying for the first quarter-mile, the remaining money is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \$8.50 - \$3.50 = \$5.00
     \]
   - This $5.00 is what you have left to spend on additional distance.

3. **Cost for Additional Distance:**
   - The cab charges 10 cents ($0.10) for each additional quarter-mile. This means that for every $0.10 you spend, you can travel an additional 0.25 miles.

4. **Calculate the Number of Additional Quarter-Miles:**
   - With the remaining $5.00, you can calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can afford:
     \[
     \$5.00 \div \$0.10 = 50 \text{ additional quarter-miles}
     \]

5. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - The total distance traveled is the sum of the initial quarter-mile and the additional quarter-miles:
     - The first quarter-mile is 0.25 miles.
     - The additional 50 quarter-miles amount to:
       \[
       50 \times 0.25 = 12.5 \text{ miles}
       \]
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ miles} + 12.5 \text{ miles} = 12.75 \text{ miles}
     \]

63,,"In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a batting average in cricket. The batting average is calculated as the total number of runs scored divided by the number of matches played.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51. This means:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51
\]

From this equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54. The total number of matches after the finals is \( x + 1 \), and the total runs scored becomes \( y + 78 \). Therefore, the new batting average equation is:

\[
\frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
\]

Expand the right side:

\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \):

\[
51x + 78 - 54 = 54x
\]

\[
51x + 24 = 54x
\]

Subtract \( 51x \) from both sides:

\[
24 = 3x
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 8
\]

Since \( x \) represents the number of matches before the finals, the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season, including the finals, is \( x + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

C) 9
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: C) 9

To arrive at this conclusion, we first set up the equations based on the information given in the problem. We used the concept of batting average, which is the total runs scored divided by the number of matches played. By setting up the equations for the batting average before and after the finals, we were able to solve for the number of matches played before the finals, \( x \), and then add one to account for the finals match. This led us to determine that the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season is 9.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

D)10
E)20",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, where each code can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, meaning that a pair like ""AB"" is the same as ""BA"".

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use a single letter as a code, each letter represents one type of book. If we have \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use a pair of letters, the number of unique pairs we can create from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is the number of ways to choose 2 letters from \( n \) without regard to order.

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the total number of unique codes (single letters + pairs of letters) is at least 10.

Let's calculate for different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3 (A, B, C)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) (AB, AC, BC)
  - Total codes = 3 + 3 = 6

  This is not enough, as we need at least 10 codes.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 4 (A, B, C, D)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD)
  - Total codes = 4 + 6 = 10

  This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **\( n = 5 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 5 (A, B, C, D, E)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \) (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE)
  - Total codes = 5 + 10 = 15

  This exceeds the requirement, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) is the smallest number of letters that allows us to create at least 10 unique codes, the correct answer is:

**B) 4**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: **B) 4**

To determine the correct answer, we need to find the smallest number of letters, \( n \), that allows us to create at least 10 unique codes using either single letters or pairs of letters. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: With \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: The number of unique pairs of letters that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 letters from \( n \) without regard to order.

3. **Total Codes**: The total number of unique codes is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-of-letters codes, which is \( n + \binom{n}{2} \).

We need this total to be at least 10. Let's calculate for different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3 (A, B, C)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) (AB, AC, BC)
  - Total codes = 3 + 3 = 6

  This is not enough, as we need at least 10 codes.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 4 (A, B, C, D)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD)
  - Total codes = 4 + 6 = 10

  This is exactly 10, which meets the requirement.

- **\( n = 5 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 5 (A, B, C, D, E)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \) (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE)
  - Total codes = 5 + 10 = 15

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle and then use those dimensions to calculate the perimeter.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 150 square meters.
   - The length (L) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth (B). This can be expressed as:
     \[
     L = 4B + 1
     \]

2. **Use the area formula for a rectangle:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Breadth}
     \]
   - Substituting the given area and the expression for the length, we have:
     \[
     150 = (4B + 1) \times B
     \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Expanding the equation:
     \[
     150 = 4B^2 + B
     \]
   - Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:
     \[
     4B^2 + B - 150 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \(a = 4\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -150\).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
     \]
   - The square root of 2401 is 49, so:
     \[
     B = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for B:
     \[
     B = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad B = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25
     \]
   - Since a breadth cannot be negative, we take \(B = 6\).

5. **Find the length using the expression for L:**
   - Substitute \(B = 6\) into the expression for L:
     \[
     L = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25
     \]

6. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Breadth})
     \]
   - Substitute the values of L and B:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62
     \]

7. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters, which corresponds to option (C).

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need to solve for the number of grams, \( x \), such that:
     \[
     9\% \times x = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]
   - Therefore, at least 11.11 grams are needed to meet the vitamin E requirement.

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need to solve for the number of grams, \( y \), such that:
     \[
     8\% \times y = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]
   - Therefore, at least 12.5 grams are needed to meet the vitamin A requirement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - To satisfy both requirements simultaneously, we need to consume the greater of the two amounts calculated above, since each gram contributes to both vitamins.
   - The greater amount is 12.5 grams.

First, let's calculate the total work needed in terms of large cakes and small cakes:

1. **Large Cakes Requirement:**
   - We need 20 large cakes.

2. **Small Cakes Requirement:**
   - We need 700 small cakes.

Next, let's determine the work capacity of one helper:

- A helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
- A helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total time required for one helper to make the required number of cakes:

1. **Time for Large Cakes:**
   - To make 20 large cakes, the time required by one helper is:
     \[
     \text{Time for large cakes} = \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{2 \text{ large cakes/hr}} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Time for Small Cakes:**
   - To make 700 small cakes, the time required by one helper is:
     \[
     \text{Time for small cakes} = \frac{700 \text{ small cakes}}{35 \text{ small cakes/hr}} = 20 \text{ hours}

Since the kitchen is available for only 3 hours, we need to calculate how many helpers are required to complete both tasks within this time frame.

- **Total time required by one helper to complete both tasks:**
  \[
  \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ hours (for large cakes)} + 20 \text{ hours (for small cakes)} = 30 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total time available per helper:**
  \[
  \text{Time available per helper} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]

To find the number of helpers required, we divide the total time required by the time available per helper:

\[

B)7
C)8
D)9
E)10",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the line segment RU given the information about the points R, S, T, and U on a line.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Use the midpoint information:**
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is equal to the length of UT. Therefore, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

3. **Determine the position of the points:**
   - We know the total length from S to T is 22, and U is exactly in the middle, so SU = 11 and UT = 11.
   - We also know that the total length from R to T is 17.

4. **Calculate RU:**
   - We have the following segments: RS = 5, ST = 22, and RT = 17.
   - Since RT = RS + ST, we can check if this holds: RT = 5 + 22 = 27, which is not equal to 17. This means R is not between S and T.
   - Instead, R must be on the opposite side of S from T. Therefore, the line is arranged as R, S, U, T.

**Final Answer: A) 6**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the line segment RU given the information about the points R, S, T, and U on a line.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Use the midpoint information:**
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is equal to the length of UT. Therefore, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

3. **Determine the position of the points:**
   - We know the total length from S to T is 22, and U is exactly in the middle, so SU = 11 and UT = 11.
   - We also know that the total length from R to T is 17.

4. **Calculate RU:**
   - We have the following segments: RS = 5, ST = 22, and RT = 17.
   - Since RT = RS + ST, we can check if this holds: RT = 5 + 22 = 27, which is not equal to 17. This means R is not between S and T.
   - Instead, R must be on the opposite side of S from T. Therefore, the line is arranged as R, S, U, T.
   - Since RT = 17 and ST = 22, the segment RS must be subtracted from ST to find RU.
   - RU = RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6.

5. **Verify the calculation:**
   - We have calculated RU = 6, which is consistent with the arrangement of points and the given lengths.

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 6, which corresponds to option (A).

69,,"Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain. Let's define variables for the amount of falafel in each type of bread:

- Let \( P \) be the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- Let \( R \) be the amount of falafel in one roll.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of falafel in one baguette.

We are given the following relationships:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   3P = R
   \]

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B
   \]
   We can substitute \( R \) from the first equation:
   \[
   3(3P) = 5B
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   9P = 5B
   \]

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Let's express two baguettes in terms of pita breads:

- From the equation \( 9P = 5B \), we can express \( B \) in terms of \( P \):
  \[
  B = \frac{9}{5}P
  \]

- Therefore, two baguettes contain:
  \[
  2B = 2 \times \frac{9}{5}P = \frac{18}{5}P
  \]

Now, we need to determine how many pita breads contain \(\frac{18}{5}P\) amount of falafel. Since each pita bread contains \( P \) amount of falafel, the number of pita breads required is:
\[
\frac{\frac{18}{5}P}{P} = \frac{18}{5}
\]

Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \(\frac{18}{5}\) pita breads. However, this value is not directly listed in the options. Let's check the options to see if any of them match this value:

None of these options directly match \(\frac{18}{5}\). However, upon reviewing the problem, it seems there might be a mistake in the interpretation or simplification. Let's re-evaluate the simplification:

- From \( 9P = 5B \), we have \( B = \frac{9}{5}P \).
- For two baguettes: \( 2B = 2 \times \frac{9}{5}P = \frac{18}{5}P \).

This should indeed be the correct simplification, but it seems there is a mismatch with the options. Let's verify the calculations:

- If \( 9P = 5B \), then \( B = \frac{9}{5}P \).

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding the Discount**: 
   - The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items. This means that the selling price on the discount day is 80% of the original price. 
   - If the original price of an item is \( P \), the discounted price is \( 0.8P \).

2. **Finding the Required Increase**:
   - The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price \( P \).
   - We need to find the percentage increase from the discounted price \( 0.8P \) back to the original price \( P \).

3. **Calculating the Increase**:
   - The difference between the original price and the discounted price is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).
   - To find the percentage increase, we calculate the increase relative to the discounted price:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Simplifying the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{0.2P}{0.8P} = \frac{0.2}{0.8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage increase is:
     \[
     0.25 \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) 25%.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 25%.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first understood that a 20% discount means the selling price is 80% of the original price. If the original price is \( P \), the discounted price becomes \( 0.8P \). To revert to the original price \( P \), we need to calculate the percentage increase from \( 0.8P \) back to \( P \).

The increase needed is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \). To find the percentage increase, we divide this increase by the discounted price \( 0.8P \) and multiply by 100%:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{0.2}{0.8}\right) \times 100\% = 0.25 \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price, making the correct answer (C) 25%.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the train fare for one person.
- \( B \) as the bus fare for one person.

According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2B = \frac{4}{3}T \]

From this equation, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( T \):
\[ B = \frac{2}{3}T \]

Next, we are given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. We can express this as:
\[ 6B + 8T = 1512 \]

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The ship travels 180 miles before the plane starts.
   - The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship.
   - We need to find the total distance from the starting point when they meet.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the speed of the plane is \( 10v \).

3. **Time Analysis:**
   - The ship has already traveled 180 miles. The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is \( \frac{180}{v} \) hours.
   - Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.

4. **Distance Analysis:**
   - In time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( vt \).
   - In the same time \( t \), the plane travels a distance of \( 10vt \).

5. **Equation Setup:**
   - At the meeting point, the total distance traveled by the ship is \( 180 + vt \).
   - The total distance traveled by the plane is \( 10vt \).
   - Since they meet at the same point, the total distance from the starting point is the same for both:
     \[
     180 + vt = 10vt
     \]

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     180 = 10vt - vt
     \]
     \[
     180 = 9vt
     \]

7. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - Substitute \( t = \frac{20}{v} \) back into the distance equation for the ship:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 180 + vt = 180 + v \left(\frac{20}{v}\right) = 180 + 20 = 200
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The total distance from the starting point when the ship and the plane meet is 200 miles.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 200.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 200.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We identified that the ship travels 180 miles before the plane starts, and the plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship.

2. **Defining Variables:** We set the ship's speed as \( v \) and the plane's speed as \( 10v \).

3. **Time Analysis:** We calculated the time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles as \( \frac{180}{v} \) hours. We introduced \( t \) as the time after the plane starts when they meet.

4. **Distance Analysis:** We expressed the additional distance traveled by the ship as \( vt \) and the distance traveled by the plane as \( 10vt \).

5. **Equation Setup:** We set up the equation \( 180 + vt = 10vt \) to represent the meeting point.

6. **Solving the Equation:** We simplified the equation to \( 180 = 9vt \) and solved for \( t \) as \( \frac{20}{v} \).

7. **Calculating the Total Distance:** We substituted \( t = \frac{20}{v} \) back into the equation for the ship's total distance, resulting in \( 180 + 20 = 200 \).

8. **Conclusion:** The total distance from the starting point when the ship and the plane meet is 200 miles, which corresponds to option (C).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
76,,"In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of proportions to estimate the total deer population in the forest. The key idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample should be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Proportion of Tagged Deer in the Sample:**
   - In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of these were tagged.
   - The proportion of tagged deer in this sample is \( \frac{20}{500} = 0.04 \).

2. **Set Up the Proportion for the Entire Population:**
   - We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. We assume this number represents the total number of tagged deer in the forest in 2002, as there is no change in population.
   - Let \( N \) be the total deer population in the forest.
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population should be the same as the proportion in the sample, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{300}{N} = 0.04
     \]

3. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - To find \( N \), solve the equation:
     \[
     300 = 0.04 \times N
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.04 to isolate \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{0.04} = 7500
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The total deer population in the forest is 7500.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 7500.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (E) 7500.

The reasoning process involves using the concept of proportions to estimate the total deer population. By setting up the proportion of tagged deer in the sample to be representative of the entire population, we can solve for the total number of deer. The calculation confirms that the total deer population in the forest is 7500, making option (E) the correct choice.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
A)0.9
B)0.8
C)0.6
D)0.65
E)1.5",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. We have two train lines: the main line and the harbor line. The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M., and the harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M.

Let's break down the schedule:

- Main line train schedule: 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, ...
- Harbor line train schedule: 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, ...

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:10 A.M. (since the problem doesn't specify an exact time, we assume he arrives uniformly at random within this interval).

To find the probability of catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals during which each train is the first to arrive:

1. If the man arrives between 5:00 and 5:02, the main line train is the first train he can catch.
2. If the man arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, the harbor line train is the first train he can catch.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

- The total time interval is 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10).
- The time interval where the main line train is the first to arrive is 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02).
- The time interval where the harbor line train is the first to arrive is 8 minutes (from 5:02 to 5:10).

The probability of catching the first train (the main line train) is the length of the interval where it is the first to arrive divided by the total interval:

Probability = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval) = 2/10 = 0.2

However, the problem asks for the probability of catching the first train that arrives, regardless of which line it is. Since the man will catch the first train that arrives, and there are no other trains arriving between 5:00 and 5:10, the probability of catching the first train is actually 1.0 (since he will definitely catch one of the trains).

Given the choices, none of them directly match 1.0, but the closest logical interpretation is that the man will always catch a train, so the probability of catching the first train is effectively 1.0. However, since the choices do not include 1.0, we must consider the context of the problem and the options provided.

Upon reviewing the options, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem's context or the options provided. The correct interpretation based on the problem's setup should be that the man will always catch a train, so the probability should be 1.0, but since this is not an option, we must assume there is an error in the options or the problem's interpretation.

Therefore, based on the given options and the logical reasoning, the closest answer that reflects the man catching a train (though not perfectly matching the expected probability of 1.0) is not directly available.

1. The average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons.
2. After adding the heavy-duty truck, the average weight of the 11 vehicles becomes 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

Let's break down the steps to find the weight of the heavy-duty truck:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles.**

The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Therefore, the total weight of these 10 vehicles is:

\[ \text{Total weight of 10 vehicles} = 10 \times 12.2 = 122 \text{ tons} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the 11 vehicles after adding the heavy-duty truck.**

The new average weight of the 11 vehicles is 14.8 tons. Therefore, the total weight of these 11 vehicles is:

\[ \text{Total weight of 11 vehicles} = 11 \times 14.8 = 162.8 \text{ tons} \]

**Step 3: Determine the weight of the heavy-duty truck.**

The weight of the heavy-duty truck is the difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:

\[ \text{Weight of the heavy-duty truck} = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

The correct answer is (A) 40.8.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) 40.8.

To solve the problem, we followed these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:**

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the population changes over the years.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population one year from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \]

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

\[ 1.21 = 2 \]

This equation is not correct, which means we need to adjust our understanding. The equation should actually reflect the relationship between the population one year ago and the population two years from now. Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P_0 \), the population now as \( P_1 \), and the population two years from now as \( P_2 \).

Given:
- \( P_2 = 2 \times P_0 \)
- \( P_2 = P_1 \times 1.21 \)

From the first equation, we have:

\[ P_2 = 2 \times P_0 \]

From the second equation, we have:

\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.21 \]

Equating the two expressions for \( P_2 \):

\[ 2 \times P_0 = P_1 \times 1.21 \]

Solving for \( P_1 \):

\[ P_1 = \frac{2 \times P_0}{1.21} \]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( P_0 \) to \( P_1 \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0}\right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute \( P_1 \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{\frac{2 \times P_0}{1.21} - P_0}{P_0}\right) \times 100\% \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{2 - 1.21}{1.21}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{0.79}{1.21}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} \approx 65.29\% \]

The closest option to 65.29% is 65%.

   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( P_1 \):
     \[
     P_1 = \frac{2 \times P_0}{1.21}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Percent Increase:**
   - The percent increase from \( P_0 \) to \( P_1 \) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0}\right) \times 100\%

   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - According to the problem, \( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \).

Now, let's write these equations:

1. \( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)
   - Simplifying: \( S + 30 = 2A - 60 \)
   - Rearranging: \( S = 2A - 90 \)  (Equation 1)

2. \( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \)
   - Simplifying: \( A + 10 = 3S - 30 \)

Now, we have a system of two equations:
- \( S = 2A - 90 \)
- \( A = 3S - 40 \)

We can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

Substitute \( S = 2A - 90 \) into \( A = 3S - 40 \):

\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]

Rearrange to solve for \( A \):

\[ 310 = 6A - A \]
\[ 310 = 5A \]

83,,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) (the untrimmed side) and \( s - 4 \) (the trimmed side).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles. The legs of each triangle are \( s \) and \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**
   - The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For one of the triangles, the base is \( s \) and the height is \( s - 4 \).
   - Therefore, the area of one triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation: \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: \(s \times (s - 4) = 140\).
   - Expand the equation: \(s^2 - 4s = 140\).
   - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation: \(s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\).

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula: \(s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -140\).
   - Calculate the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576\).
   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Substitute into the quadratic formula: \(s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}\).

6. **Finding the Positive Solution:**
   - The solutions are \(s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14\) and \(s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10\).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, we take \(s = 14\).

7. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The side length of the original square is 14 feet.
   - The perimeter of a square is \(4 \times \text{side length}\).
   - Therefore, the perimeter is \(4 \times 14 = 56\) feet.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) 56**.

84,,"The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now?
A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means for the length of the ribbon to be reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the original length of the ribbon is divided into two parts in the ratio 5:3, and the new length corresponds to the smaller part of this division.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, the new length is 3 parts. This implies that the original length is divided into a total of 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

2. **Calculating the Length of Each Part**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. Since this length is divided into 8 equal parts, each part is:
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Finding the New Length**: The new length corresponds to 3 parts of the original 8 parts (as per the ratio 5:3). Therefore, the new length is:
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, upon reviewing the options provided, 11.25 cm is not listed. This suggests a potential misinterpretation of the problem or a need to reassess the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

- The problem states the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3, which means the new length is 3 parts out of the total 8 parts of the original length.

4. **Re-evaluating the Calculation**: 
   - The original length is 30 cm.
   - The new length is 3 parts out of 8 parts of the original length.
   - Therefore, the new length should be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{New length} = \frac{3}{8} \times 30 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
     \]

Given the options, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem setup or the options provided. However, if we consider the closest whole number approximation or a potential oversight in the problem statement, the closest option to 11.25 cm is 12 cm.

Therefore, the most reasonable choice given the options is:
\[
\boxed{E) 12}
\]
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem correctly, let's carefully analyze the given information and the concept of ratio reduction.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The problem states that the ribbon's length is reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the original length is divided into two parts where the first part is 5 units and the second part is 3 units. The new length corresponds to the smaller part of this division, which is the 3-unit part.

2. **Total Parts in the Ratio**: The total number of parts in the ratio 5:3 is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

3. **Calculating the Length of Each Part**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. Since this length is divided into 8 equal parts, each part is:
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Finding the New Length**: The new length corresponds to the 3 parts of the original 8 parts (as per the ratio 5:3). Therefore, the new length is:
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, 11.25 cm is not one of the options provided. Let's reassess the problem statement and the options:

- The problem might be interpreted differently, or there might be a rounding or approximation involved in the options.

5. **Re-evaluating the Options**: Given the options, the closest whole number to 11.25 cm is 12 cm. This suggests that the problem might expect a rounded or approximate answer.

Therefore, the most reasonable choice given the options is:

85,,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations involving the three-digit numbers \( M \) and \( N \).

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number where \( a, b, c \) are digits.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Expressing \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substituting into the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a + 297c = 990
   \]

6. **Dividing the Entire Equation by 99:**
   \[
   a + 3c = 10
   \]

7. **Finding Possible Values of \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we solve \( a + 3c = 10 \).
   - Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are:
     - \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit)
     - \( c = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
     - \( c = 2 \), \( a = 4 \)
     - \( c = 3 \), \( a = 1 \)

8. **Checking the Condition \( M > N \):**
   - For each valid pair \((a, c)\), we need to ensure \( M > N \).

9. **Calculating \( M \) for Each Pair:**
   - For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\):
     - \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 7 = 107 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is always true since \( 701 > 107 \).

   - For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\):
     - \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 2 + 10b + 4 = 204 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is always true since \( 402 > 204 \).

   - For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\):
     - \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 3 + 10b + 1 = 301 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is not possible since \( 103 < 301 \).

10. **Counting Valid \( M \) Values Greater Than 300:**
    - For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 701 + 10b \) (all values are > 300)
      - \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
    - For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 402 + 10b \) (all values are > 300)
      - \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.

11. **Total Values of \( M \) Greater Than 300:**
    - Total = 10 (from \( a = 7, c = 1 \)) + 10 (from \( a = 4, c = 2 \)) = 20.

C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area at a rate of 10 square feet per day.

1. **Determine the Grazing Area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - Substituting the radius (14 feet) into the formula gives:
     \[
     A = \pi \times (14)^2 = \pi \times 196
     \]
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 3.14 \times 196 = 615.44 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
   - To find the number of days required to graze the entire area, divide the total area by the grazing rate:
     \[
     \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} = 61.544
     \]
   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since the options provided are whole numbers and 62 is not an option, we consider the closest available option.

   - The closest option to 62 is 61, which is option (B).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 61 days.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 61 days.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed these steps:

1. **Calculate the Grazing Area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, allowing it to graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \).
   - Substituting the radius (14 feet) into the formula gives:
     \[
     A = \pi \times (14)^2 = \pi \times 196
     \]
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 3.14 \times 196 = 615.44 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
   - To find the number of days required to graze the entire area, divide the total area by the grazing rate:
     \[
     \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} = 61.544
     \]
   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since 62 is not an option, we choose the closest available option.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Determine the Cost Price:**
   - The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%.
   - Let the cost price be \( C \).
   - The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C
     \]
   - We know the selling price is Rs. 27.50, so:
     \[
     1.10C = 27.50
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**
   - If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this with the cost price of Rs. 25.00.
   - The difference between the selling price and the cost price is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
     \]
   - Since the selling price (Rs. 25.75) is greater than the cost price (Rs. 25.00), this is a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**
   - The profit percentage is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 = 3\%
     \]

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit. The correct answer is:

**B) 3% Profit**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: **B) 3% Profit**

Here's a detailed breakdown of how I arrived at this conclusion:

1. **Determine the Cost Price:**
   - The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price is 110% of the cost price.
   - Let the cost price be \( C \).
   - The equation for the selling price with a 10% profit is:
     \[
     1.10C = 27.50
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \) gives:
     \[
     C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
     \]
   - Thus, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**
   - If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we compare this with the cost price of Rs. 25.00.
   - The difference between the selling price and the cost price is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
     \]
   - Since the selling price (Rs. 25.75) is greater than the cost price (Rs. 25.00), this results in a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**
   - The profit percentage is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 = 3\%
     \]

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit. The correct answer is **B) 3% Profit**.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)7
B)3
C)2
D)1
E)6",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan must be on the left of Tim.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is given by the factorial of 3, which is:

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

These 6 arrangements are:
1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Susan, Zen, Tim
3. Tim, Susan, Zen
4. Tim, Zen, Susan
5. Zen, Susan, Tim
6. Zen, Tim, Susan

Next, we apply the condition that Susan must be on the left of Tim. This condition affects the arrangements where Susan and Tim are directly compared. 

Let's analyze the 6 arrangements:
- In arrangement 1 (Susan, Tim, Zen), Susan is on the left of Tim. This is valid.
- In arrangement 2 (Susan, Zen, Tim), Susan is on the left of Tim. This is valid.
- In arrangement 3 (Tim, Susan, Zen), Susan is not on the left of Tim. This is invalid.
- In arrangement 4 (Tim, Zen, Susan), Susan is not on the left of Tim. This is invalid.
- In arrangement 5 (Zen, Susan, Tim), Susan is on the left of Tim. This is valid.
- In arrangement 6 (Zen, Tim, Susan), Susan is not on the left of Tim. This is invalid.

From the above, we see that there are 3 valid arrangements where Susan is on the left of Tim:
1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Susan, Zen, Tim
3. Zen, Susan, Tim

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the children such that Susan is on the left of Tim is 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 3.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first calculated the total number of permutations of the three children, which is 6. Then, we applied the condition that Susan must be on the left of Tim. By examining each of the 6 possible arrangements, we identified the ones that satisfy this condition. Specifically, arrangements 1, 2, and 5 meet the requirement, resulting in 3 valid arrangements.

91,,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. The bill is composed of a fixed part and a variable part that depends on the number of calls made.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.
- \( C \) as the number of calls made.

The total bill can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Bill} = F + V \times C \]

We have two scenarios given in the problem:

1. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[ F + 540V = 1800 \]

2. When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[ F + 620V = 2040 \]

We have two equations with two unknowns (F and V). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of F and V.

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):
\[ (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800 \]
\[ 620V - 540V = 240 \]
\[ 80V = 240 \]
\[ V = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Let's use the first equation:
\[ F + 540 \times 3 = 1800 \]
\[ F + 1620 = 1800 \]
\[ F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 \]

Now we have determined:
- The fixed part of the bill, \( F = 180 \)
- The variable cost per call, \( V = 3 \)

Now, we need to calculate the bill for a month when 500 calls are made:
\[ \text{Total Bill} = F + V \times C \]
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 180 + 3 \times 500 \]
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 180 + 1500 \]
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 1680 \]

Therefore, the bill for the month when 500 calls are made is Rs.1680.

The correct answer is (B) Rs.1680.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) Rs.1680.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first set up the equations based on the information given in the problem. The bill is composed of a fixed part \( F \) and a variable part that depends on the number of calls \( C \) made, with a variable cost per call \( V \). The total bill can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Total Bill} = F + V \times C \]

We used the two scenarios provided to create two equations:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[ F + 540V = 1800 \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[ F + 620V = 2040 \]

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we eliminated \( F \) and solved for \( V \):

\[ 80V = 240 \]
\[ V = 3 \]

With \( V = 3 \), we substituted back into the first equation to solve for \( F \):

\[ F + 540 \times 3 = 1800 \]
\[ F + 1620 = 1800 \]
\[ F = 180 \]

Now, with both \( F \) and \( V \) known, we calculated the bill for 500 calls:

\[ \text{Total Bill} = 180 + 3 \times 500 \]
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 180 + 1500 \]
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 1680 \]

Thus, the bill for the month when 500 calls are made is Rs.1680, which corresponds to option (B).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after they begin rotating. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

1. **Ball A:**
   - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball A is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.

2. **Ball B:**
   - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball B is \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

- 13 is a prime number, and 7 is also a prime number.
- Since 13 and 7 have no common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply their product: \( 13 \times 7 = 91 \).

Thus, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Finally, we convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes make 1 hour, and 91 - 60 = 31).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 1 hour and 31 minutes
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 1 hour and 31 minutes

To arrive at this conclusion, we calculated the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation and then found the least common multiple (LCM) of these times. Ball A completes one rotation in 13 minutes, and Ball B completes one rotation in 7 minutes. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product, which is 91 minutes. Converting 91 minutes into hours and minutes gives us 1 hour and 31 minutes. Thus, the correct answer is option A.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
93,,"A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
A)10
B)15
C)18
D)20
E)30",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction. We are given the following information:

- Total number of books on the bookshelf: 45
- Number of hardcover books: 30
- Number of fiction books: 20

We are looking for the maximum overlap between the hardcover books and the fiction books. This is essentially asking for the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction.

To find this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of elements in the union of two sets is:

\[ |H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \]

Where:
- \( |H| \) is the number of hardcover books (30),
- \( |F| \) is the number of fiction books (20),
- \( |H \cap F| \) is the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction,
- \( |H \cup F| \) is the total number of books (45).

We want to maximize \( |H \cap F| \). Rearranging the formula gives us:

\[ |H \cap F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cup F| \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ |H \cap F| = 30 + 20 - 45 = 5 \]

However, this calculation gives us the minimum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, not the maximum. To find the maximum, we need to consider the constraints:

1. The maximum number of hardcover books is 30.
2. The maximum number of fiction books is 20.

The maximum overlap occurs when all fiction books are hardcover. Since there are 20 fiction books, and we can have up to 30 hardcover books, all 20 fiction books can be hardcover. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D) 20
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem:

1. There are 30 hardcover books.
2. There are 20 fiction books.

The goal is to find the maximum overlap between these two categories, meaning we want to find the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction.

Since there are 20 fiction books, the maximum number of these that can also be hardcover is 20, assuming all fiction books are hardcover. This is possible because the number of hardcover books (30) is greater than the number of fiction books (20), allowing all fiction books to potentially be hardcover.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**
   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})
   \]
   For the given rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm}
   \]
   This means the total length of the wire is 88 cm.

2. **Form a Square with the Same Perimeter:**
   When the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. The perimeter of a square is given by:
   \[
   P = 4 \times \text{side length}

Here's the detailed reasoning process:

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \).
   - For the given rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm, the calculation is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - This means the total length of the wire is 88 cm.

2. **Form a Square with the Same Perimeter:**
   - When the wire is reshaped into a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm.
   - The formula for the perimeter of a square is \( P = 4 \times \text{side length} \).

3. **Solve for the Side Length of the Square:**
   - Set the perimeter of the square equal to the perimeter of the wire:
     \[
     4 \times \text{side length} = 88
     \]
   - Solve for the side length by dividing the total perimeter by 4:
     \[
     \text{side length} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \text{ cm}

A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each daughter receives based on the given conditions.

Let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed among all the children:
- There are 5 sons, so the total amount for the sons is \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so the total amount for the daughters is \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- There are 2 nephews, so the total amount for the nephews is \( 2 \times x = 2x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of the amounts given to the sons, daughters, and nephews:
\[ 25x + 16x + 2x = 43x \]

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so we set up the equation:
\[ 43x = 8600 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 43:
\[ x = \frac{8600}{43} \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ x = 200 \]

Now that we know \( x = 200 \), we can find out how much each daughter receives:
Each daughter receives \( 4x = 4 \times 200 = 800 \).

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information she provided. Meenu stated that her weight is 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( W \).

According to the problem, Meenu's weight can be expressed by the equation:
\[ W = 29 + \frac{1}{2}W \]

To solve for \( W \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the fraction by multiplying every term in the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 2W = 58 + W \]

Next, we subtract \( W \) from both sides to solve for \( W \):
\[ 2W - W = 58 \]
\[ W = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. 

Now, let's verify our solution by substituting \( W = 58 \) back into the original statement:
- Half of Meenu's weight is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 58 = 29 \).
- Adding 29 to this half-weight gives \( 29 + 29 = 58 \), which matches the weight we calculated.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 58.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (D) 58.

To determine Meenu's weight, we set up the equation based on her statement: ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" Let \( W \) represent Meenu's weight. The equation becomes:

\[ W = 29 + \frac{1}{2}W \]

To solve for \( W \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2W = 58 + W \]

Next, we subtract \( W \) from both sides to isolate \( W \):

\[ 2W - W = 58 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ W = 58 \]

Thus, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. We verified this by checking that half of 58 is 29, and adding 29 to 29 gives 58, which is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 58.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

101,,"A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. Since the ages are given in years, we need to convert the common difference into years. 

1. **Convert the common difference to years:**
   - 3 months is equivalent to \( \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) years.

2. **Define the terms of the A.P.:**
   - Let the number of members in the club be \( n \).
   - The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term \( a = 7 \).
   - The ages of the members are: \( 7, 7 + \frac{1}{4}, 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4}, \ldots, 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Sum of the A.P.:**
   - The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
     \]
   - Here, \( S_n = 250 \), \( a = 7 \), and \( d = \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Substitute the values into the sum formula:**
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(\frac{56 + n - 1}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{55 + n}{4}
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n(55 + n)}{8}
   \]
   \[
   2000 = n(55 + n)
   \]
   \[
   2000 = 55n + n^2
   \]
   \[
   n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
   \]

5. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \).
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000)}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{3025 + 8000}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{11025}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2}
   \]

   - Calculate the two possible values for \( n \):
     - \( n = \frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
     - \( n = \frac{-55 - 105}{2} = \frac{-160}{2} = -80 \) (not possible since \( n \) must be positive)

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of members in the club is \( n = 25 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{25} \), which corresponds to option (C).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 25.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach:

1. **Convert the common difference to years:** The common difference of 3 months is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{4} \) years.

2. **Define the terms of the A.P.:** The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression starting at 7 years, with a common difference of \( \frac{1}{4} \) years.

3. **Sum of the A.P.:** We used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
   \]
   Substituting the known values, we set up the equation:
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we obtained:
   \[
   2000 = n(55 + n)
   \]
   \[
   n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic equation:** Using the quadratic formula, we found the possible values for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2}
   \]
   This gave us \( n = 25 \) as the only positive solution.

Thus, the number of members in the club is 25, which matches option (C).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

   - Therefore, the initial contribution per man is \( \frac{D}{M} \).

2. **New Contribution per Man After 3 Men Drop Out:**
   - If 3 men drop out, the number of men left is \( M - 3 \).
   - The total cost of the gift remains Rs. D.
   - The new contribution per man is \( \frac{D}{M-3} \).

3. **Increase in Contribution per Man:**
   - The increase in contribution per man is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution.
   - Increase = New Contribution - Initial Contribution
   - Increase = \( \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M} \)

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - To simplify \( \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M} \), we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M-3) \).
   - Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{D \cdot M}{M(M-3)} - \frac{D \cdot (M-3)}{M(M-3)}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we arrived at this conclusion:

1. **Initial Contribution per Man:**
   - Originally, each of the M men contributes equally to the total cost of Rs. D.
   - Therefore, the initial contribution per man is \( \frac{D}{M} \).

2. **New Contribution per Man After 3 Men Drop Out:**
   - After 3 men drop out, the number of men left is \( M - 3 \).
   - The total cost of the gift remains Rs. D.
   - The new contribution per man is \( \frac{D}{M-3} \).

3. **Increase in Contribution per Man:**
   - The increase in contribution per man is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution.
   - Increase = New Contribution - Initial Contribution
   - Increase = \( \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M} \)

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - To simplify \( \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M} \), we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M-3) \).
   - Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{D \cdot M}{M(M-3)} - \frac{D \cdot (M-3)}{M(M-3)}
     \]

A)1,879
B)1,875
C)1,876
D)1,872
E)1,800",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the sewing machine such that after offering a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit on the cost price.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Cost Price and Desired Profit:**
   - The cost price (CP) of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - Karan wants to make a 20% profit on this cost price.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - A 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200 means the selling price (SP) should be:
     \[
     \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit} = 1200 + (0.20 \times 1200) = 1200 + 240 = 1440
     \]
   - So, Karan needs to sell the sewing machine for Rs. 1440 to achieve a 20% profit.

3. **Determine the Marked Price with a 20% Discount:**
   - The selling price after a 20% discount should be Rs. 1440.
   - Let the marked price be \( M \).
   - A 20% discount on the marked price means the selling price is 80% of the marked price:
     \[
     0.80 \times M = 1440
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{1440}{0.80} = 1800
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If the marked price is Rs. 1800, a 20% discount would reduce it by:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1800 = 360
     \]
   - The selling price after the discount would be:
     \[
     1800 - 360 = 1440
     \]
   - This matches the required selling price to achieve a 20% profit.

Therefore, the correct marked price is Rs. 1800, which corresponds to option (E).

The correct answer is (E) 1,800.

A)12 am on the next day
B)5 am on the next day
C)5 pm on the next day
D)2 pm on the next day
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine when Train 'B' will catch up to Train 'A'. 

1. **Understand the problem setup:**
   - Train 'A' departs at 11 am and travels at 40 kmph.
   - Train 'B' departs at 2 pm and travels at 72 kmph.
   - Both trains are traveling the same route from Mumbai Central to Lucknow.

2. **Calculate the head start of Train 'A':**
   - Train 'A' leaves 3 hours before Train 'B' (from 11 am to 2 pm).
   - In these 3 hours, Train 'A' travels a distance of:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 40 \, \text{kmph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{km}
     \]
   - Therefore, Train 'A' has a 120 km head start when Train 'B' starts at 2 pm.

3. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - The relative speed between Train 'B' and Train 'A' is the difference in their speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative Speed} = 72 \, \text{kmph} - 40 \, \text{kmph} = 32 \, \text{kmph}
     \]
   - This means Train 'B' is closing the gap between itself and Train 'A' at a rate of 32 km per hour.

4. **Calculate the time it takes for Train 'B' to catch up:**
   - To catch up the 120 km head start, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{32 \, \text{kmph}} = 3.75 \, \text{hours}
     \]

5. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train 'B' starts at 2 pm. Adding 3.75 hours to this time gives:
     \[

Since 5:45 pm on the same day is not listed among the options, the correct answer is:

E) None of these
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) None of these

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Train 'A' departs at 11 am and travels at 40 kmph.
   - Train 'B' departs at 2 pm and travels at 72 kmph.
   - Both trains are on the same route from Mumbai Central to Lucknow.

2. **Head Start Calculation:**
   - Train 'A' has a 3-hour head start (from 11 am to 2 pm).
   - In 3 hours, Train 'A' covers:
     \[
     40 \, \text{kmph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{km}
     \]
   - Thus, Train 'A' is 120 km ahead when Train 'B' starts at 2 pm.

3. **Relative Speed:**
   - The relative speed of Train 'B' with respect to Train 'A' is:
     \[
     72 \, \text{kmph} - 40 \, \text{kmph} = 32 \, \text{kmph}
     \]
   - This means Train 'B' is closing the gap at 32 km per hour.

4. **Time to Catch Up:**
   - Time taken for Train 'B' to close the 120 km gap:
     \[
     \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{32 \, \text{kmph}} = 3.75 \, \text{hours}
     \]

5. **Meeting Time:**
   - Train 'B' starts at 2 pm. Adding 3.75 hours:
     \[
     2 \, \text{pm} + 3.75 \, \text{hours} = 5:45 \, \text{pm}

A)22
B)60
C)28
D)26
E)18",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given in the problem.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the amount of money Mark has.
- \( J \) as the amount of money John has.

According to the problem, Mark tells John, ""If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \]

John then says, ""If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \]

We have two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

We need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( M \) and \( J \).

First, let's solve the first equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \]

Substitute this expression for \( M \) into the second equation:
\[ J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75 \]
\[ J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ J - \frac{J}{6} = 50 \]

Combine the terms involving \( J \):
\[ \frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50 \]
\[ \frac{5J}{6} = 50 \]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[ 5J = 300 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ J = 60 \]

Thus, John has Rs.60. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 60.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, we need to solve the system of equations derived from the problem statement.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Mark says, ""If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75."" This translates to:
   \[
   M + \frac{J}{2} = 75
   \]
   where \( M \) is the amount of money Mark has, and \( J \) is the amount of money John has.

2. John says, ""If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75."" This translates to:
   \[
   J + \frac{M}{3} = 75
   \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

First, solve the first equation for \( M \):
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}

Substitute this expression for \( M \) into the second equation:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]
\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[
J - \frac{J}{6} = 50
\]

Combine the terms involving \( J \):
\[
\frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50
\]
\[
\frac{5J}{6} = 50
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[
5J = 300
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
J = 60
\]

A)x2/y2 units
B)y3/x2 units
C)x3/y2 units
D)y2/x2 units
E)None of these",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work they can complete.

The problem states that ""x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days."" This implies that the total work done is a function of the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. Specifically, the total work done (W) can be expressed as:

\[ W = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Number of hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days}) \]

Given that x men working x hours per day can complete x units of work in x days, we can set up the equation:

\[ x \times x \times x = x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x^3 = x \]

Since x is not zero (as it represents a number of men, hours, and days), we can divide both sides by x:

\[ x^2 = 1 \]

Now, we need to determine how much work y men working y hours per day can complete in y days. Using the same formula for work:

\[ W' = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Number of hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days}) \]

Substituting y for the number of men, hours per day, and days, we get:

\[ W' = y \times y \times y = y^3 \]

Now, we need to express this in terms of x, using the relationship we found earlier (x^2 = 1). Since x^2 = 1, we can substitute this into our expression for y^3:

\[ W' = y^3 \]

We need to express y^3 in terms of x^2. Since x^2 = 1, we can consider the ratio of y^3 to x^2:

\[ \frac{y^3}{x^2} = y^3 \]

Thus, the amount of work that y men working y hours per day can complete in y days is:

\[ \frac{y^3}{x^2} \]

This matches option (B) from the choices given:

B) y^3/x^2 units

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) y^3/x^2 units.

108,,"ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F?
A)12
B)10
C)5
D)15
E)20",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different quadrilaterals can be formed by selecting 4 points from the 6 given points: A, B, C, D, E, and F. 

First, let's consider the total number of ways to choose 4 points from these 6 points. This can be calculated using the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of points, and \( k \) is the number of points to choose. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \).

\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 ways to choose 4 points from the 6 points.

Next, we need to ensure that each selection of 4 points forms a quadrilateral. In this context, a quadrilateral is formed as long as the 4 points do not all lie on the same line (which is not possible here since no 4 points are collinear in a regular pentagon with a center point).

Since the problem involves a regular pentagon and its center, any selection of 4 points will indeed form a quadrilateral. This is because:

1. If we choose 4 points from A, B, C, D, and E (the vertices of the pentagon), they will form a quadrilateral.
2. If we include the center point F in our selection, the remaining 3 points from A, B, C, D, and E will form a triangle with F, which is also a valid quadrilateral.

Therefore, all 15 combinations of choosing 4 points from the 6 available points will result in a valid quadrilateral.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D) 15
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate how many different quadrilaterals can be formed by selecting 4 points from the 6 given points: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

1. **Calculate the Total Combinations:**
   We use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 4 points from 6:
   \[
   \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. **Verify Quadrilateral Formation:**
   In a regular pentagon with a center point, any selection of 4 points will form a quadrilateral. This is because:
   - Choosing 4 points from the vertices (A, B, C, D, E) will always form a quadrilateral.
   - Including the center point F with any 3 vertices will also form a quadrilateral, as the center point ensures no collinearity.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since all 15 combinations of choosing 4 points from the 6 available points result in a valid quadrilateral, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is 15.

B)130°
C)140°
D)160°
E)220°",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the arcs and the points on the circle.

1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference.
   - Minor arc AC is 160°.
   - Minor arc BD is 150°.
   - Point B bisects minor arc AC.

2. **Analyzing the Bisection:**
   - Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that arc AB = arc BC.
   - Therefore, arc AB = arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.

3. **Determining Arc AD:**
   - We need to find the measure of minor arc AD.
   - Arc AD can be expressed as the sum of arcs AB and BD.
   - We already know arc AB = 80°.
   - We are given that minor arc BD = 150°.

4. **Calculating Arc AD:**
   - Arc AD = arc AB + arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.

5. **Checking the Options:**
   - The calculated measure of arc AD is 230°, but this is not one of the options provided.
   - Let's reconsider the problem: the options suggest a possible oversight or misinterpretation.

6. **Re-evaluating the Problem:**
   - Since B bisects arc AC, and we calculated arc AB = 80°, we should consider the circle's total 360°.
   - Arc AC = 160°, and arc BD = 150°, which means the remaining arc (arc CD) is 360° - 160° - 150° = 50°.
   - Arc AD is the sum of arcs AB and BD, but we need to consider the circle's totality.

7. **Correct Calculation:**

1. **75% of employees take a winter vacation.**
2. **40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.**
3. **20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.**

We need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

First, let's determine the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither vacation, the remaining 80% take at least one type of vacation (either winter, summer, or both).

Next, we know that 75% take a winter vacation. Out of these, 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation (and not a summer vacation) is:

\[ 75\% - 40\% = 35\% \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one vacation and 20% take neither, we know that:

\[ \text{Percentage taking at least one vacation} = 80\% \]

The percentage of employees who take a summer vacation (either only summer or both summer and winter) can be calculated by considering the total percentage of employees who take at least one vacation minus those who take only a winter vacation:

\[ \text{Percentage taking a summer vacation} = 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

This 45% includes those who take both a summer and a winter vacation (40%) and those who take only a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is:

\[ 45\% - 40\% = 5\% \]

Thus, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%.

The correct answer is:

A) 5%
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 5%

To arrive at this conclusion, we carefully analyzed the given information and broke it down step by step:

1. **75% of employees take a winter vacation.**
2. **40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.**
3. **20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.**

From this, we deduced that 80% of employees take at least one type of vacation (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Next, we calculated the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation by subtracting those who take both vacations from those who take a winter vacation:

\[ 75\% - 40\% = 35\% \]

This means 35% of employees take only a winter vacation.

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation, we subtracted those who take only a winter vacation from those who take at least one vacation:

\[ 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

This 45% includes both those who take only a summer vacation and those who take both vacations. Since 40% take both vacations, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is:

\[ 45\% - 40\% = 5\% \]

Thus, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%, making the correct answer A) 5%.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

- \( b_2 = 6 \) meters (the bottom width of the canal),
- \( A = 640 \) square meters (the area of the cross-section).

We need to find the depth \( h \) of the canal.

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[

1. **Identify the radius of the circle**: The point is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, so the radius \( r \) of the circle is 10 cm.

2. **Determine the circumference of the circle**: The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula \( C = 2\pi r \). Substituting the radius:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of revolutions in 30 seconds**: The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute. First, convert this rate to revolutions per second:

The expression for \( x \) is:

\[
x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}
\]

First, let's simplify the expression in the numerator:

1. The term \( n^2 \) is straightforward.
2. The term \( 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be expanded to \( 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} \).
3. The constant term is \( 16 \).

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4
\]

Notice that the expression in the numerator can be rewritten by completing the square:

\[
n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2
\]

This is because:

\[
(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 = n^2 + 2n\cdot4\sqrt{n} + 2\cdot4\sqrt{n}\cdot4 + 16 = n^2 + 8n\sqrt{n} + 32\sqrt{n} + 16
\]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) simplifies to:

\[
x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4
\]

Now, we need to find the range of \( x = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \) for \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

1. For \( n = 36 \):
   \[
   x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64
   \]

2. For \( n = 72 \):
   \[
   x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4
   \]

   To find \( 4\sqrt{72} \), note that \( \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   4\sqrt{72} = 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} = 24\sqrt{2}
   \]

   Approximating \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we get:
   \[
   24\sqrt{2} \approx 24 \times 1.414 = 33.936
   \]

   So:
   \[
   x \approx 72 + 33.936 + 4 = 109.936
   \]

Thus, the range of \( x \) is approximately \( 64 \leq x \leq 109.936 \).

Now, let's compare this range with the given options:

- (A) \( 20 < x < 54 \) is incorrect.

1. For \( n = 36 \):
   \[
   x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64
   \]

2. For \( n = 72 \):
   \[
   x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4
   \]

   To find \( 4\sqrt{72} \), note that \( \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   4\sqrt{72} = 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} = 24\sqrt{2}
   \]

   Approximating \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we get:
   \[
   24\sqrt{2} \approx 24 \times 1.414 = 33.936
   \]

   So:
   \[
   x \approx 72 + 33.936 + 4 = 109.936
   \]

Thus, the range of \( x \) is approximately \( 64 \leq x \leq 109.936 \).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A starts with Rs.40,000.
   - B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000.
   - C joins later with Rs.120,000.
   - Total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.
   - C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000.

2. **Determine the Time Each Partner Invested:**
   - A is in the business for 12 months.
   - B joins after 2 months, so he is in the business for 10 months.
   - Let C join 'x' months after B. Since B joins after 2 months, C joins after (2 + x) months from the start. Therefore, C is in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.

3. **Calculate the Profit Sharing Ratio:**
   - The profit share is based on the product of capital and time.
   - A's contribution: \( 40,000 \times 12 \)

117,,"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
A)8.75
B)8.79
C)8.75
D)8.71
E)8.72",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the square paper and then subtract the area of the two semi-circles that are cut out.

1. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   - The paper is in the form of a square with each side measuring 20 cm.
   - The area of a square is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \text{side} \times \text{side} \).
   - Therefore, the area of the square is \( 20 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

2. **Calculate the area of the semi-circles:**
   - Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square, using the sides of the square as diameters.
   - The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, which is the same as the side of the square.
   - The radius of each semi-circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \, \text{cm} \).
   - The area of a full circle is given by the formula: \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \).
   - Therefore, the area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is \( \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - Since we have semi-circles, the area of one semi-circle is half of the full circle: \( \frac{100\pi}{2} = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - There are two semi-circles, so the total area of the semi-circles is \( 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper.
   - The area of the remaining paper is \( 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).

4. **Approximate the value:**
   - Use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \).
   - Therefore, \( 100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314 \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - The area of the remaining paper is approximately \( 400 - 314 = 86 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

Upon reviewing the choices, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misprint in the options provided, as none of them match the calculated area of 86 cm². However, based on the calculations, the correct area of the remaining paper should be approximately 86 cm².

1. **Area of the Square:**
   - The square has a side length of 20 cm.
   - Area of the square = \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

2. **Area of the Semi-Circles:**
   - Each semi-circle has a diameter of 20 cm, so the radius is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).
   - Area of a full circle = \( \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - Area of one semi-circle = \( \frac{100\pi}{2} = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - Total area of two semi-circles = \( 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).

3. **Area of the Remaining Paper:**
   - Remaining area = \( 400 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), \( 100\pi \approx 314 \, \text{cm}^2 \).
   - Remaining area = \( 400 - 314 = 86 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

A)93 men
B)94 men
C)95 men
D)96 men
E)97 men",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of days, and the amount of work completed. The problem states that 8 men can complete the work in 6 days. We need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.

First, let's determine the total amount of work done in terms of ""man-days."" A ""man-day"" is the amount of work one man can complete in one day. If 8 men complete the work in 6 days, the total work is:

\[ \text{Total work} = 8 \, \text{men} \times 6 \, \text{days} = 48 \, \text{man-days} \]

This means the entire work requires 48 man-days to complete.

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's denote the number of men required as \( x \).

The equation for the work done in terms of man-days is:

\[ x \, \text{men} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{day} = 48 \, \text{man-days} \]

Solving for \( x \), we have:

\[ x \times \frac{1}{2} = 48 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:

\[ x = 48 \times 2 \]

\[ x = 96 \]

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day.

The correct answer is (D) 96 men.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (D) 96 men.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first calculated the total amount of work in terms of ""man-days,"" which is a measure of the work done by one man in one day. Given that 8 men complete the work in 6 days, the total work is 48 man-days (8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days).

Next, we needed to determine how many men are required to complete the same amount of work in just 1/2 day. We set up the equation for the work done in terms of man-days:

\[ x \, \text{men} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{day} = 48 \, \text{man-days} \]

Solving for \( x \), we multiplied both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):

\[ x = 48 \times 2 \]

\[ x = 96 \]

Thus, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day, making the correct answer (D) 96 men.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)277
B)288
C)200
D)277
E)168",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boys and girls joined the group such that the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We start with the initial numbers and then use the given ratio to find the number of new members.

Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. Let's denote the number of boys and girls who joined the group as \( x \). Therefore, after the membership drive, the number of boys becomes \( 64 + x \) and the number of girls becomes \( 40 + x \).

According to the problem, the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We can set up the equation based on this ratio:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:

\[
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
\]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[
192 = 160 + x
\]

Subtract 160 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 32
\]

This means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. Now, we calculate the total number of members in the group:

- New number of boys: \( 64 + 32 = 96 \)
- New number of girls: \( 40 + 32 = 72 \)

The total number of members in the group is:

\[
96 + 72 = 168

Thus, the group now has 168 members. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E) 168
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) 168

To arrive at this conclusion, we first set up the problem by identifying the initial number of boys and girls in the group, which are 64 and 40, respectively. We then introduced a variable \( x \) to represent the number of boys and girls who joined the group during the membership drive. This means the new number of boys is \( 64 + x \) and the new number of girls is \( 40 + x \).

The problem states that after the membership drive, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We used this information to set up the equation:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

By cross-multiplying, we obtained:

\[
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
\]

Expanding both sides, we had:

\[
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we subtracted \( 3x \) from both sides, resulting in:

\[
192 = 160 + x
\]

Subtracting 160 from both sides gave us:

\[
x = 32
\]

This indicates that 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group. We then calculated the new total number of members:

- New number of boys: \( 64 + 32 = 96 \)
- New number of girls: \( 40 + 32 = 72 \)

Adding these together, the total number of members in the group is:

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let the original number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, subtracting 30 from this number gives us one third of the number:
     \[
     x - 30 = \frac{x}{3}
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3 to get rid of the denominator:
     \[
     3(x - 30) = x
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     3x - 90 = x
     \]
   - Move \( x \) from the right side to the left side to isolate terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     3x - x = 90
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2x = 90
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 45
     \]

4. **Finding 50% of the Number:**
   - Now that we know the original number \( x \) is 45, we need to find 50% of this number.
   - Calculate 50% of 45:
     \[
     0.5 \times 45 = 22.5
     \]

5. **Selecting the Correct Answer:**
   - The value of 50% of the original number is 22.5, which corresponds to option (A).

A)15 kmph
B)6 kmph
C)12 kmph
D)14 kmph
E)6 kmph",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the man's rowing speed in still water, the speed of the current, and his effective speed against and along the current.

1. **Identify the given speeds:**
   - The man's rowing speed in still water is 4 kmph.
   - His speed against the current is 2 kmph.

2. **Understand the concept:**
   - When rowing against the current, the effective speed is reduced by the speed of the current. Therefore, the equation for rowing against the current is:
     \[
     \text{Speed against current} = \text{Speed in still water} - \text{Speed of current}
     \]
   - When rowing along the current, the effective speed is increased by the speed of the current. Therefore, the equation for rowing along the current is:
     \[
     \text{Speed along current} = \text{Speed in still water} + \text{Speed of current}
     \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the current:**
   - From the equation for rowing against the current:
     \[
     2 = 4 - \text{Speed of current}
     \]
   - Solving for the speed of the current:
     \[
     \text{Speed of current} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ kmph}

E)112",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find a three-digit number \( \overline{abc} \) where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are its digits. We are given three conditions:

1. The sum of the digits is 17: 
   \[
   a + b + c = 17
   \]

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
   \]

3. Subtracting 495 from the number results in the reverse of the number:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
   \]

Let's simplify the third condition:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
\]
\[
100a + c - 495 = 100c + a
\]
\[
99a - 99c = 495
\]
\[
a - c = 5
\]

Now we have three equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)
3. \( a - c = 5 \)

From equation 3, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
\[
a = c + 5
\]

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(c + 5) + b + c = 17
\]
\[
2c + b = 12
\]
\[
b = 12 - 2c
\]

Now substitute \( a = c + 5 \) and \( b = 12 - 2c \) into equation 2:
\[
(c + 5)^2 + (12 - 2c)^2 + c^2 = 109
\]

Expanding each term:
\[
(c + 5)^2 = c^2 + 10c + 25
\]
\[
(12 - 2c)^2 = 144 - 48c + 4c^2
\]
\[
c^2 = c^2
\]

Substitute these into the equation:
\[
c^2 + 10c + 25 + 144 - 48c + 4c^2 + c^2 = 109
\]
\[
6c^2 - 38c + 169 = 109
\]
\[
6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0
\]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1
\]

Since the discriminant is 1, the roots are:
\[
c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}
\]

This gives us:
\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(not an integer, discard)}
\]
\[
c = \frac{18}{6} = 3
\]

So, \( c = 3 \). Substitute back to find \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8

\[
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 6 = 6

A)18
B)20
C)22
D)24
E)26",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many senators can be attributed to Hoopsmot based on his contribution to the total bribery pool.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money in the bribery pool. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 and Smolapon contributes $4,000. Therefore, the total pool is:

\[ 16,000 + 4,000 = 20,000 \]

Next, we know that this total amount of $20,000 is used to influence 30 senators. We need to find out how many senators can be attributed to Hoopsmot's contribution of $16,000.

To do this, we calculate the cost per senator by dividing the total amount by the number of senators:

\[ \text{Cost per senator} = \frac{20,000}{30} = \frac{2000}{3} \]

Now, we determine how many senators Hoopsmot's $16,000 can influence. We do this by dividing his contribution by the cost per senator:

\[ \text{Senators influenced by Hoopsmot} = \frac{16,000}{\frac{2000}{3}} = 16,000 \times \frac{3}{2000} = 16 \times 3 = 24 \]

ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many senators can be attributed to Hoopsmot based on his contribution to the total bribery pool.

1. **Calculate the Total Bribery Pool:**
   - Hoopsmot contributes $16,000.
   - Smolapon contributes $4,000.
   - Total pool = $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

2. **Determine the Cost per Senator:**
   - The total pool of $20,000 is used to influence 30 senators.
   - Cost per senator = Total pool / Number of senators = $20,000 / 30 = $666.67 (approximately).

3. **Calculate Senators Attributed to Hoopsmot:**
   - Hoopsmot's contribution = $16,000.
   - Senators influenced by Hoopsmot = Hoopsmot's contribution / Cost per senator.
   - Senators influenced by Hoopsmot = $16,000 / $666.67 ≈ 24.

D)None of these
E)Cannot be determined",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers, let's call them \( x \) and \( y \), such that:

1. The difference of their squares is 256000: \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000: \( x + y = 1000 \)

We can use the identity for the difference of squares, which states:

\[ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \]

Given that \( x + y = 1000 \), we can substitute this into the identity:

\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]

Substituting \( x + y = 1000 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

To find \( x - y \), we divide both sides by 1000:

\[ x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 1256 \]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[ x = 628 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 628 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 1000 \):

\[ 628 + y = 1000 \]

Solving for \( y \), we subtract 628 from both sides:

\[ y = 1000 - 628 = 372 \]

Thus, the two numbers are 628 and 372. We can verify this solution by checking the difference of their squares:

\[ x^2 - y^2 = 628^2 - 372^2 \]

Calculating each square:

\[ 628^2 = 394384 \]
\[ 372^2 = 138384 \]

The difference is:

\[ 394384 - 138384 = 256000 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B) 628, 372
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: B) 628, 372

The reasoning process involves using the given conditions and applying algebraic identities to solve for the unknowns. We start with the equations derived from the problem:

1. \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. \( x + y = 1000 \)

Using the difference of squares identity, we rewrite the first equation as:

\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]

Substituting the known sum \( x + y = 1000 \) into the equation gives:

\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

Solving for \( x - y \) by dividing both sides by 1000:

\[ x - y = 256 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

Adding these equations:

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]
\[ 2x = 1256 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628 \]

Substituting \( x = 628 \) back into \( x + y = 1000 \):

\[ 628 + y = 1000 \]
\[ y = 1000 - 628 = 372 \]

Thus, the numbers are 628 and 372. Verification by calculating the difference of their squares confirms the solution:

   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{km} + 48 \, \text{km} = 78 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 6 \, \text{h} + 12 \, \text{h} = 18 \, \text{h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average speed:**

   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{78 \, \text{km}}{18 \, \text{h}} = \frac{78}{18} \, \text{km/h}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**

   \[
   \frac{78}{18} = \frac{39}{9} = \frac{13}{3} \, \text{km/h}
   \]

   Converting \(\frac{13}{3}\) to a mixed number:
   \[
   \frac{13}{3} = 4 \frac{1}{3} \, \text{km/h}

The correct answer is **(A) 4 1/3 km/h**.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, let's go through the reasoning process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the distance for each part of the journey:**

   - **First part:** The man walks at 5 km/h for 6 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{km/h} \times 6 \, \text{h} = 30 \, \text{km}
     \]

   - **Second part:** The man walks at 4 km/h for 12 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 4 \, \text{km/h} \times 12 \, \text{h} = 48 \, \text{km}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance:**

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{km} + 48 \, \text{km} = 78 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 6 \, \text{h} + 12 \, \text{h} = 18 \, \text{h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average speed:**

   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{78 \, \text{km}}{18 \, \text{h}} = \frac{78}{18} \, \text{km/h}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**

   \[
   \frac{78}{18} = \frac{39}{9} = \frac{13}{3} \, \text{km/h}
   \]

   Converting \(\frac{13}{3}\) to a mixed number:
   \[
   \frac{13}{3} = 4 \frac{1}{3} \, \text{km/h}

A)2
B)3
C)4
D)5
E)6",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.

1. **Understanding the Median**: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. If the median income is $3000, it means that when the incomes are listed in ascending order, $3000 is the middle value.

2. **Understanding the Total Income**: The total income of the family is $9000. This is the sum of all individual incomes in the family.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - If there are 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes, which cannot be $3000 unless both earn $3000, which would make the total $6000, not $9000.
   - If there are 3 members, the median is the second income when arranged in order. If the median is $3000, the total could be $3000 + $3000 + $3000 = $9000, which fits the total income.
   - If there are 4 members, the median would be the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes must average to $3000. This scenario is possible, but it complicates the distribution of the remaining income to fit the total of $9000.
   - If there are 5 members, the median is the third income. If the median is $3000, the total could be $3000 + $3000 + $3000 + $0 + $0 = $9000, but this doesn't fit the total income.
   - If there are 6 members, the median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes must average to $3000. This scenario is possible, but it complicates the distribution of the remaining income to fit the total of $9000.

4. **Conclusion**: The simplest and most straightforward scenario is with 3 members, where each member earns $3000. This satisfies both the condition of the median being $3000 and the total income being $9000.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3.

   - **3 Members**: The median is the second income when arranged in order. If the median is $3000, the incomes could be $3000, $3000, and $3000, which sums to $9000. This fits both the median and total income conditions perfectly.
   - **4 Members**: The median would be the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes must average to $3000. This scenario is possible, but it complicates the distribution of the remaining income to fit the total of $9000.
   - **5 Members**: The median is the third income. If the median is $3000, the total could be $3000 + $3000 + $3000 + $0 + $0 = $9000, but this doesn't fit the total income.
   - **6 Members**: The median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes must average to $3000. This scenario is possible, but it complicates the distribution of the remaining income to fit the total of $9000.

4. **Conclusion**: The simplest and most straightforward scenario is with 3 members, where each member earns $3000. This satisfies both the condition of the median being $3000 and the total income being $9000.

134,,"An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization?
A)300
B)200
C)400
D)100
E)500",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of employees in the organization based on the given conditions about their contributions.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial Contribution:**
   - The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh.
   - Let the number of employees be \( n \).
   - Each employee contributes an equal amount, so the contribution per employee is \( \frac{600000}{n} \).

2. **Increased Contribution:**
   - If each employee contributes Rs. 60 more, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh.
   - The new contribution per employee is \( \frac{600000}{n} + 60 \).
   - The total contribution with the increased amount is \( n \times \left(\frac{600000}{n} + 60\right) = 624000 \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We equate the total increased contribution to Rs. 6.24 lakh:
     \[
     n \times \left(\frac{600000}{n} + 60\right) = 624000
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
     \[
     600000 + 60n = 624000
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 600000 from both sides:
     \[
     60n = 24000
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 60 to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{24000}{60} = 400
     \]

Thus, the number of employees in the organization is 400.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 400.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 400.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach to set up and solve the equation based on the problem's conditions. We first defined the initial contribution per employee and then considered the scenario where each employee contributes an additional Rs. 60. By equating the total increased contribution to Rs. 6.24 lakh, we derived an equation that allowed us to solve for the number of employees, \( n \). The calculations confirmed that there are 400 employees in the organization, making option (C) the correct choice.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)3267
B)2678
C)2797
D)2300
E)2781",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of eligible voters:**
   - We start with a total of 5,000 voters.
   - 20% of these voters are not eligible to vote.
   - To find the number of ineligible voters, calculate 20% of 5,000:
     \[
     0.20 \times 5000 = 1000
     \]
   - Subtract the ineligible voters from the total to find the number of eligible voters:
     \[
     5000 - 1000 = 4000
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - Since there are two candidates, the winning candidate received more than half of the total votes.
   - First, calculate 15% of the total eligible votes (4,000):
     \[
     0.15 \times 4000 = 600
     \]
   - The winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate. Therefore, the winning candidate received half of the votes plus the additional 15%:
     \[
     \text{Votes for winning candidate} = \frac{4000}{2} + 600 = 2000 + 600 = 2600
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - The losing candidate received the remaining votes:
     \[
     4000 - 2600 = 1400
     \]
   - The difference between the winning and losing candidate's votes is:
     \[
     2600 - 1400 = 1200
     \]
   - This difference should be 15% of the total votes:
     \[
     0.15 \times 4000 = 600
     \]
   - There seems to be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the winning candidate's votes:
     - The winning candidate should have received 15% more than half of the votes:
     \[
     \text{Votes for winning candidate} = \frac{4000}{2} + 0.15 \times 4000 = 2000 + 600 = 2600
     \]

Upon reviewing the calculations, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The winning candidate should have received 15% more than the other candidate, not 15% of the total votes. Therefore, the correct calculation should be:

- The winning candidate received 57.5% of the total votes (since 50% + 15% of the remaining 50%):
  \[
  0.575 \times 4000 = 2300
  \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D) 2300**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: **D) 2300**

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Ineligible voters = 20% of 5,000 = 1,000
   - Eligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% more votes than the other candidate.
   - This means the winning candidate received 57.5% of the total votes (since 50% + 15% of the remaining 50% = 57.5%).
   - Calculate 57.5% of the eligible votes:
     \[
     0.575 \times 4000 = 2300
     \]

3. **Verification:**
   - The losing candidate received the remaining votes:
     \[
     4000 - 2300 = 1700
     \]
   - The difference between the winning and losing candidate's votes is:
     \[
     2300 - 1700 = 600
     \]
   - This difference is indeed 15% of the total eligible votes:
     \[

A)4
B)3
C)2
D)1
E)0",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought up to earn exactly $3.40, given the payment rates for copper and brass coins.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.
- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The diver earns:
- 20 cents for each copper coin, so \( 20x \) cents for \( x \) copper coins.
- 25 cents for each brass coin, so \( 25y \) cents for \( y \) brass coins.

The total earnings from one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) (the number of copper coins) that satisfies this equation with non-negative integer values for both \( x \) and \( y \).

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:
\[ 4x + 5y = 68 \]

Now, we need to find integer solutions for this equation. We are particularly interested in minimizing \( x \).

To find the minimum \( x \), let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 5y = 68 - 4x \]
\[ y = \frac{68 - 4x}{5} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 68 - 4x \) must be divisible by 5. Let's check the values of \( x \) starting from 0 upwards to find the smallest \( x \) that makes \( y \) an integer.

1. **\( x = 0 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(0)}{5} = \frac{68}{5} = 13.6 \] (not an integer)

2. **\( x = 1 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(1)}{5} = \frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \] (not an integer)

3. **\( x = 2 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(2)}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \] (integer)

Since \( y = 12 \) is an integer when \( x = 2 \), this is a valid solution. We have found that the minimum number of copper coins \( x \) is 2.

A)9
B)6
C)4
D)3
E)2",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between Winson's home and his school, given his speeds and the total time for the round trip.

Let's denote the distance from Winson's home to his school as \( d \) miles.

1. **Calculate the time taken to run to school:**
   - Winson runs to school at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to run to school is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to walk back home:**
   - Winson walks back home at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk back is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{d}{5} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total time:**
   - The total time for the entire journey (running to school and walking back) is 1 hour.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{5} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - First, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10.
   - Rewrite the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} + \frac{2d}{10} = 1
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{10} = 1
     \]
   - Solve for \( d \) by multiplying both sides by 10:
     \[
     3d = 10
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. Let's break down the information given and the steps needed to find the solution:

1. **Initial Inventory**: The store started with 600 golf balls in total.

2. **Sales Information**: By the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory. Therefore, the number of golf balls sold is:
   \[
   0.8 \times 600 = 480
   \]
   So, 480 golf balls were sold.

3. **Equal Sales of Yellow and White Balls**: The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

4. **Determine the Number of White Golf Balls Sold**: Since all the white golf balls were sold, and they were sold in equal numbers to the yellow golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total number of golf balls sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of white golf balls sold} = \frac{480}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Initial Number of White Golf Balls**: Since all white golf balls were sold, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

6. **Calculate Initial Number of Yellow Golf Balls**: The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600. Since 240 of these were white, the remaining must be yellow:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow golf balls} = 600 - 240 = 360
   \]

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. The correct answer is:

E) 360
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) 360

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a logical sequence of steps based on the information provided in the problem:

1. **Initial Inventory**: The store started with 600 golf balls.

2. **Sales Calculation**: The store sold 80% of its inventory, which amounts to 480 golf balls (0.8 * 600 = 480).

3. **Equal Sales of Yellow and White Balls**: The problem specifies that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all white golf balls were sold.

4. **Determine the Number of White Golf Balls Sold**: Since the sales were equal and all white golf balls were sold, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total sold, which is 240 (480 / 2 = 240).

5. **Initial Number of White Golf Balls**: Since all white golf balls were sold, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

6. **Calculate Initial Number of Yellow Golf Balls**: Subtract the initial number of white golf balls from the total to find the initial number of yellow golf balls: 600 - 240 = 360.

A)12 metre
B)12.5 metre
C)13.5 metre
D)14 metre
E)15 metre",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand that the situation described involves similar triangles. The flagstaff and its shadow form one right triangle, and the building and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the triangles are similar, and we can use the properties of similar triangles to find the height of the building.

Given:
- Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
- Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
- Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

We need to find the height of the building.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the flagstaff should be equal to the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the building. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of flagstaff}}{\text{Length of flagstaff's shadow}} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{\text{Length of building's shadow}}
\]

Substituting the known values into the proportion:

\[
\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{28.75}
\]

To find the height of the building, we solve for it by cross-multiplying:

\[
\text{Height of building} = \frac{17.5 \times 28.75}{40.25}
\]

Now, let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the product of 17.5 and 28.75:
   \[
   17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125
   \]

2. Divide this product by 40.25 to find the height of the building:
   \[
   \frac{503.125}{40.25} \approx 12.5
   \]

Therefore, the height of the building is approximately 12.5 meters.

The correct answer is (B) 12.5 metre.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 12.5 metre.

To arrive at this conclusion, we used the concept of similar triangles, which states that corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional. Given the height and shadow length of the flagstaff, we set up a proportion with the shadow length of the building to find its height. By solving the proportion, we calculated the height of the building to be approximately 12.5 meters, which matches option (B).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)3 hours
B)5 hours
C)6 hours
D)4 hours
E)7 hours",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the two cars to be 15 miles apart, given their different speeds.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Car 1 travels at 55 mph.
   - Car 2 travels at 52 mph.
   - We need to find the time it takes for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds. Since they are traveling in the same direction, the relative speed is:
     \[
     \text{Relative Speed} = 55 \text{ mph} - 52 \text{ mph} = 3 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - We want the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles. Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ mph} \times \text{Time}
     \]

3. **Solve for Time:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - After 5 hours, Car 1 will have traveled \( 55 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 275 \text{ miles} \).
   - Car 2 will have traveled \( 52 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 260 \text{ miles} \).
   - The difference in distance is \( 275 \text{ miles} - 260 \text{ miles} = 15 \text{ miles} \), which matches the required condition.

A)0.5
B)0.6
C)0.7
D)0.8
E)0.9",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of probability for independent events. We are given:

- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)

We need to find \( P(B) \).

For independent events, the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is given by:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Substituting this into the formula for \( P(A \cup B) \), we get:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \times P(B) \]

We know \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \) and \( P(A) = 0.6 \). Plug these values into the equation:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:

\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E) 0.9
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) 0.9

To arrive at this conclusion, we used the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events, \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \), and the fact that for independent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \). By substituting the given probabilities and solving the resulting equation, we determined that the probability of event B occurring is 0.9.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

\[ \text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Cost Price (CP):**
   - The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450.
   - Therefore, the Cost Price (CP) is Rs. 450.

2. **Determine the Selling Price (SP):**
   - The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg.
   - Therefore, the Selling Price (SP) for 90 kg is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{SP} = 90 \, \text{kg} \times 7.50 \, \text{Rs/kg} = 675 \, \text{Rs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Gain:**

To find when the two trains cross each other, we need to determine their relative positions at any given time after both have started their journeys.

Let's establish a common timeline:

- Train M starts at 5 am.
- Train N starts at 7 am.

Since Train M starts 2 hours earlier than Train N, by the time Train N starts at 7 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. 

Now, let's calculate the speeds of the trains:

- Train M travels the entire distance from City A to City B in 4 hours. Let's denote the distance between City A and City B as D. Therefore, the speed of Train M is D/4 per hour.

- Train N travels the entire distance from City B to City A in 3.5 hours. Therefore, the speed of Train N is D/3.5 per hour.

At 7 am, Train M has already covered a distance of (D/4) * 2 = D/2. This means Train M is halfway to City B when Train N starts its journey.

From 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. The combined speed of the two trains is the sum of their individual speeds:

- Combined speed = (D/4) + (D/3.5) = (7D/28) + (4D/14) = (7D/28) + (8D/28) = 15D/28 per hour.

The remaining distance between the two trains at 7 am is D/2 (since Train M has already covered D/2).

To find the time it takes for the trains to meet, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

The distance to be covered is D/2, and the speed is 15D/28. Therefore:

Time = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/15D) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours.

14/15 hours is equivalent to 14 * 60 / 15 = 56 minutes.

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

The correct answer is (D) 56 min.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem of determining when the two trains cross each other, we need to analyze the given information and calculate the time based on their speeds and starting times.

1. **Train M's Journey:**
   - Leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time = 4 hours.
   - Speed of Train M = Distance (D) / 4 hours.

2. **Train N's Journey:**
   - Leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time = 3.5 hours.
   - Speed of Train N = Distance (D) / 3.5 hours.

3. **Timeline Analysis:**
   - Train M starts at 5 am.
   - Train N starts at 7 am.
   - By 7 am, Train M has been traveling for 2 hours and has covered half the distance (D/2).

4. **Relative Motion:**
   - From 7 am, both trains are moving towards each other.
   - Combined speed = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N = (D/4) + (D/3.5).
   - Simplifying the combined speed: 
     - Convert to a common denominator: (D/4) = (7D/28) and (D/3.5) = (8D/28).
     - Combined speed = (7D/28) + (8D/28) = 15D/28.

5. **Time Calculation:**
   - Remaining distance to be covered after 7 am = D/2.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = (D/2) / (15D/28).
   - Simplifying: (D/2) * (28/15D) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours.

6. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
   - 14/15 hours = 14 * 60 / 15 = 56 minutes.

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at 7:56 am. The correct answer is (D) 56 min.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
150,,"Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
A)1 minute
B)2 minutes
C)3 minutes
D)4 minutes
E)5 minutes",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Janice and Jennie together to bike a total of 1 mile. We know their individual biking speeds: Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate their combined biking speed. Since they are biking together, we can add their speeds:

- Janice's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Jennie's speed: 20 miles per hour

Combined speed = 10 miles per hour + 20 miles per hour = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at this combined speed of 30 miles per hour.

The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

In this case, the distance is 1 mile, and the speed is 30 miles per hour. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} \]

Since the answer choices are given in minutes, we need to convert this time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{1}{30} \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile. The correct answer is:

B) 2 minutes
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: B) 2 minutes

To arrive at this conclusion, I first calculated the combined biking speed of Janice and Jennie by adding their individual speeds: 10 miles per hour for Janice and 20 miles per hour for Jennie, resulting in a total of 30 miles per hour. 

Next, I used the formula for time, which is the distance divided by speed, to determine how long it would take them to collectively bike 1 mile at this combined speed. The calculation was:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} \]

Since the answer choices were in minutes, I converted the time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{1}{30} \times 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the correct answer is B) 2 minutes.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

5. **Calculating the Value:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     M = 960

152,,"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?
A)6
B)8
C)10
D)12
E)14",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the number of people attending the party and the number of bottles of soda needed. The problem states that Jill needed 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. We need to find out how many bottles she will need for a party with 12 people.

First, let's calculate the number of bottles of soda per person for the initial party:

- Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people.
- Therefore, the number of bottles per person is \( \frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \) bottles per person.

Now, we need to apply this rate to a party with 12 people:

- If each person requires 1.25 bottles, then for 12 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \) bottles.

However, 15 is not one of the options provided. This suggests that the problem might be interpreted differently, or there might be a mistake in the options. Let's consider another approach:

The problem might be asking for a direct proportionality based on the number of people, assuming the same total number of bottles per person ratio. Let's calculate the ratio of people:

- The ratio of the number of people in the new party to the original party is \( \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \).

If the number of bottles scales directly with the number of people, then:

- The number of bottles needed for 12 people would be \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \).

Again, 15 is not an option. Let's consider the closest logical option based on the given choices:

- The closest option to 15 is 14, which is option (E).

Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice, considering potential rounding or estimation, is:

E) 14
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) 14

Here's the reasoning process broken down:

1. **Initial Calculation**: Jill needed 10 bottles for 8 people. This gives us a rate of 1.25 bottles per person (\( \frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \)).

2. **Scaling Up**: For 12 people, using the same rate of 1.25 bottles per person, the calculation would be \( 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \) bottles.

3. **Options Analysis**: The calculated number of 15 bottles is not listed among the options. This suggests that the problem might involve rounding or estimation.

4. **Proportionality Check**: We also considered the direct proportionality approach:
   - The ratio of the number of people in the new party to the original party is \( \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \).
   - Scaling the original 10 bottles by this ratio gives \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \).

5. **Choosing the Closest Option**: Since 15 is not an option, we look for the closest available choice. The options provided are 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The closest to 15 is 14.

A)36
B)28
C)42
D)15
E)20",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the height of an object and the length of its shadow. This is a classic problem involving similar triangles, where the height of the object and the length of its shadow are proportional.

Given:
- The first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
- The second ant is 6 inches tall, and we need to find the length of its shadow.

The relationship between the height of the ant and the length of its shadow can be expressed as a ratio. For the first ant, the ratio of height to shadow length is:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{4}{10}
\]

This ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2}{5}
\]

We assume that the same ratio applies to the second ant because they are standing side-by-side, meaning the light source and angle are the same for both ants. Therefore, the ratio for the second ant should also be:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of second ant}}{\text{Shadow of second ant}} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the length of the shadow of the second ant. Then we have:

\[
\frac{6}{x} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
2x = 6 \times 5
\]

\[
2x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.

The correct answer is:

D) 15
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: D) 15

To arrive at this solution, we used the concept of similar triangles, which tells us that the ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow remains constant when the light source and angle are the same. We applied this principle to set up a proportion based on the given information about the first ant and used it to find the shadow length of the second ant. By solving the proportion, we determined that the shadow of the taller ant is 15 inches long.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)2.6m
B)3.9m
C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   - The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means if the height is \( h \), then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{5}{2}h \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls**:
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters.
   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
   - We need to find the total area of the walls that is papered.

3. **Calculating the Area of the Walls**:
   - The total cost of Rs. 260 at Rs. 2 per meter means 130 meters of paper is used (since 260 / 2 = 130).
   - Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the total area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.

4. **Accounting for Doors and Windows**:
   - We are told that 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows.
   - Therefore, the actual area of the walls that needs to be papered is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) square meters.

5. **Relating the Area to the Room Dimensions**:
   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{P}{2} \).
   - From the ratio, we have \( h : \frac{P}{2} = 2 : 5 \), which implies \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{P}{2} = \frac{P}{5} \).

6. **Solving for the Height**:
   - The area of the walls is \( P \times h = 80 \) square meters.
   - Substitute \( h = \frac{P}{5} \) into the equation: \( P \times \frac{P}{5} = 80 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( \frac{P^2}{5} = 80 \).
   - Multiply both sides by 5: \( P^2 = 400 \).
   - Taking the square root of both sides, \( P = 20 \).

7. **Finding the Height**:
   - Since \( h = \frac{P}{5} \), substitute \( P = 20 \) into the equation: \( h = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \).

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters.

The correct answer is (C) 4m.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 4m.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach:

1. **Ratio Understanding**: We started by understanding the given ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter, which is 2:5. This allowed us to express the height in terms of the semi-perimeter.

2. **Cost and Area Calculation**: We calculated the total area of the walls that were papered by using the cost and dimensions of the paper. The cost of Rs. 260 at Rs. 2 per meter meant 130 meters of paper was used, and since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the total area covered was 65 square meters.

3. **Inclusion of Doors and Windows**: We added the area for doors and windows (15 square meters) to the papered area to get the total wall area of 80 square meters.

4. **Relating Area to Dimensions**: We used the relationship between the perimeter, height, and area of the walls to set up an equation. By substituting the expression for height in terms of the semi-perimeter, we solved for the perimeter and then the height.

5. **Final Calculation**: Solving the equation \( \frac{P^2}{5} = 80 \) led us to find the perimeter \( P = 20 \), and subsequently, the height \( h = \frac{P}{5} = 4 \).

Thus, the height of the room is 4 meters, making option (C) the correct choice.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

B)62
C)82
D)92
E)102",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of consecutive integers and how their sum is calculated.

1. **Understanding Consecutive Integers:**
   - Consecutive integers are numbers that follow each other in order without any gaps. For example, if the least integer is \( n \), then the consecutive integers can be represented as \( n, n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+(k-1) \).

2. **Sum of Consecutive Integers:**
   - The sum of \( k \) consecutive integers starting from \( n \) is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + \ldots + (n+k-1)
     \]
   - This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
   - Here, the first term is \( n \) and the last term is \( n + (k-1) \).

3. **Applying the Given Information:**
   - We are given that the least integer is \(-50\) and the sum of these \( k \) integers is 51.
   - Therefore, the first term \( n = -50 \) and the sum is 51.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers:
     \[
     \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) = 51
     \]
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:
     \[
     -50 + (-50 + k - 1) = -101 + k
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{k}{2} \times (-101 + k) = 51
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     k \times (-101 + k) = 102
     \]
   - Distribute \( k \):
     \[
     -101k + k^2 = 102
     \]
   - Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609
     \]
   - Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{10609} = 103
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( k \):
     \[
     k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102 \quad \text{and} \quad k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = -1
     \]
   - Since \( k \) must be a positive integer (as it represents the number of integers), we discard \( k = -1 \).

A)-23.5
B)-17.5
C)-10.5
D)-16.2
E)Cannot be determined",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of quadratic equations and the information given about the roots.

The quadratic equation given is:

\[ x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \]

We are told that one of the roots of this equation is 1.5. Let's denote the roots of the equation as \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \). According to the problem, \( r_1 = 1.5 \).

For a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots (\( r_1 + r_2 \)) is given by the formula:

\[ r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a} \]

And the product of the roots (\( r_1 \times r_2 \)) is given by:

\[ r_1 \times r_2 = \frac{c}{a} \]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \).

Using the sum of the roots formula:

\[ r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{m}{1} = -m \]

Since \( r_1 = 1.5 \), we can express \( r_2 \) as:

\[ 1.5 + r_2 = -m \]

Thus:

\[ r_2 = -m - 1.5 \]

Now, using the product of the roots formula:

\[ r_1 \times r_2 = \frac{22}{1} = 22 \]

Substituting \( r_1 = 1.5 \) and \( r_2 = -m - 1.5 \) into the product formula:

\[ 1.5 \times (-m - 1.5) = 22 \]

Expanding this equation:

\[ 1.5(-m) - 1.5 \times 1.5 = 22 \]

\[ -1.5m - 2.25 = 22 \]

To solve for \( m \), first add 2.25 to both sides:

\[ -1.5m = 22 + 2.25 \]

\[ -1.5m = 24.25 \]

Now, divide both sides by -1.5 to isolate \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{24.25}{-1.5} \]

\[ m = -16.1667 \]

This value is approximately -16.2, which matches one of the given options.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{D) -16.2} \]
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To determine the correct answer, we need to solve the quadratic equation using the given information that one of the roots is 1.5. The quadratic equation is:

\[ x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \]

Given that one root, \( r_1 \), is 1.5, we can use the properties of quadratic equations to find the value of \( m \).

1. **Sum of the Roots**: For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

   \[ r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a} \]

   In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \). Therefore:

   \[ r_1 + r_2 = -m \]

   Since \( r_1 = 1.5 \), we have:

   \[ 1.5 + r_2 = -m \]

   Solving for \( r_2 \):

   \[ r_2 = -m - 1.5 \]

2. **Product of the Roots**: The product of the roots is given by:

   \[ r_1 \times r_2 = \frac{c}{a} \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[ 1.5 \times (-m - 1.5) = 22 \]

   Expanding this equation:

   \[ 1.5(-m) - 1.5 \times 1.5 = 22 \]

   \[ -1.5m - 2.25 = 22 \]

3. **Solving for \( m \)**: Add 2.25 to both sides to isolate the term with \( m \):

   \[ -1.5m = 22 + 2.25 \]

   \[ -1.5m = 24.25 \]

   Divide both sides by -1.5:

   \[ m = \frac{24.25}{-1.5} \]

   \[ m = -16.1667 \]

This value is approximately -16.2, which matches option (D).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)10!/3
B)10!/6
C)10!/2
D)10!/4
E)10!/5",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 10 speakers such that the prime minister (pm) speaks before the member of parliament (mp), and the mp speaks before the member of legislative assembly (mla). 

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Number of Arrangements Without Restrictions:**
   - If there were no restrictions, the 10 speakers could be arranged in any order. The total number of arrangements is given by the factorial of the number of speakers, which is \(10!\).

2. **Applying the Restrictions:**
   - We have a specific order constraint for 3 of the speakers: pm, mp, and mla. These three must speak in the order pm before mp before mla.
   - For any specific arrangement of the 10 speakers, the 3 specific speakers (pm, mp, mla) can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) (factorial of 3) different ways if there were no restrictions on their order.

3. **Calculating the Valid Arrangements:**
   - Since we need pm to speak before mp and mp to speak before mla, only 1 of the \(3!\) arrangements of these three speakers is valid (i.e., the arrangement pm, mp, mla).
   - Therefore, the number of valid arrangements of the 10 speakers is the total number of arrangements divided by the number of invalid arrangements of the 3 specific speakers. This is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{10!}{3!}
     \]
   - Since \(3! = 6\), the number of valid arrangements is:
     \[
     \frac{10!}{6}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct answer is the number of ways to arrange the speakers such that the order constraint is satisfied, which is \(\frac{10!}{6}\).

Thus, the correct choice is **(B) 10!/6**.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 10!/6

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions:**
   - If there were no restrictions, the 10 speakers could be arranged in any order, which is \(10!\) (factorial of 10) ways.

2. **Applying the Order Restriction:**
   - We have a specific order constraint for 3 of the speakers: the prime minister (pm) must speak before the member of parliament (mp), and the mp must speak before the member of legislative assembly (mla).
   - For any specific arrangement of the 10 speakers, the 3 specific speakers (pm, mp, mla) can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) (factorial of 3) different ways if there were no restrictions on their order.

3. **Valid Arrangements:**
   - Since we need pm to speak before mp and mp to speak before mla, only 1 of the \(3!\) arrangements of these three speakers is valid (i.e., the arrangement pm, mp, mla).
   - Therefore, the number of valid arrangements of the 10 speakers is the total number of arrangements divided by the number of invalid arrangements of the 3 specific speakers. This is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{10!}{3!}
     \]
   - Since \(3! = 6\), the number of valid arrangements is:
     \[
     \frac{10!}{6}

B)20/7
C)30/7
D)40/7
E)50/7",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the original mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve a mixture with equal parts of sand and clay.

1. **Understand the Initial Composition:**
   - The original mixture is 10 kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay.
   - This means there are 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay in the mixture.

2. **Define the Desired Composition:**
   - We want the final mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay, i.e., 50% sand and 50% clay.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of the original mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand.
   - After removing \( x \) kg of the mixture, the remaining mixture will be \( 10 - x \) kg.
   - The sand in the remaining mixture will be \( 0.3(10 - x) \) kg.
   - The clay in the remaining mixture will be \( 0.7(10 - x) \) kg.

4. **Add Pure Sand:**
   - We add \( x \) kg of pure sand to the remaining mixture.
   - The total sand in the new mixture becomes \( 0.3(10 - x) + x \).

5. **Set the Sand and Clay Equal:**
   - For the final mixture to have equal parts of sand and clay, the amount of sand should equal the amount of clay:
   \[
   0.3(10 - x) + x = 0.7(10 - x)
   \]

6. **Solve the Equation:**

   \[
   3 + 1.4x = 7
   \]
   - Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   1.4x = 4
   \]
   - Divide by 1.4:
   \[
   x = \frac{4}{1.4} = \frac{40}{14} = \frac{20}{7}
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand is \( \frac{20}{7} \) kg.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) \( \frac{20}{7} \).

A)58.3%
B)62.5%
C)63.5%
D)64.5%
E)65.5%",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's new expenditure after his income increases by 20%. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let's assume the man's initial income is \( I \).
   - He spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%. Therefore, his new income is:
     \[
     I_{\text{new}} = I + 0.2I = 1.2I
     \]

3. **New Expenditure:**
   - Since the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, his expenditure as a percentage of his income remains the same. Therefore, his new expenditure is 70% of his new income:
     \[
     E_{\text{new}} = 0.7 \times 1.2I = 0.84I
     \]

4. **Expenditure as a Percentage of New Income:**
   - We need to express the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. Since the new income is \( 1.2I \), the percentage of the new income that is spent is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of new income spent} = \left(\frac{0.84I}{1.2I}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Simplifying the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{0.84I}{1.2I} = \frac{0.84}{1.2} = 0.7
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage of the new income that is spent is:
     \[
     0.7 \times 100\% = 70\%
     \]

   - The man's new expenditure is 70% of his new income. However, the problem seems to be asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income, which is not directly provided in the options. The options given (A) 58.3%, (B) 62.5%, (C) 63.5%, (D) 64.5%, (E) 65.5% do not match the 70% calculated.

This means we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of white tulips (28) and the number of red tulips (98).

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Here's how we can find the GCD of 28 and 98:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - First, we find the prime factorization of each number.
   - 28 can be factored into prime numbers as follows: \(28 = 2^2 \times 7\).
   - 98 can be factored into prime numbers as follows: \(98 = 2 \times 7^2\).

2. **Identify Common Factors:**

   - The lowest power of these common factors is \(2^1\) and \(7^1\).

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - Multiply the lowest powers of all common prime factors: \(2^1 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

Therefore, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is 14, as this is the GCD of 28 and 98. Each bouquet will contain:
- \(28 \div 14 = 2\) white tulips

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - For 28: The prime factorization is \(28 = 2^2 \times 7\).
   - For 98: The prime factorization is \(98 = 2 \times 7^2\).

2. **Identify Common Prime Factors:**
   - The common prime factors between 28 and 98 are 2 and 7.

3. **Determine the Lowest Power of Each Common Factor:**
   - For the prime factor 2, the lowest power is \(2^1\).
   - For the prime factor 7, the lowest power is \(7^1\).

4. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - Multiply the lowest powers of all common prime factors: \(2^1 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

The GCD of 28 and 98 is 14, which means we can make 14 identical bouquets. Each bouquet will contain:
- \(28 \div 14 = 2\) white tulips

A)1 hour
B)2 hours
C)3 hours
D)4 hours
E)5 hours",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Sharon and Karen need to work together to earn enough tips to buy the ice cream cake.

First, let's establish the rate at which each person earns tips:

1. **Sharon's rate**: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is 1 cake per 5 hours, or \(\frac{1}{5}\) of a cake per hour.

2. **Karen's rate**: Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is 1 cake per 4 hours, or \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a cake per hour.

Next, we need to find their combined rate of earning tips when they work together:

- **Combined rate**: The combined rate of Sharon and Karen working together is the sum of their individual rates:
  \[
  \text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}
  \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. Therefore, we convert the fractions:

- \(\frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{20}\)
- \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}\)

Adding these gives:
\[
\frac{4}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{9}{20}
\]

This means that together, Sharon and Karen earn \(\frac{9}{20}\) of a cake per hour.

Finally, we need to determine how many hours they need to work together to earn 1 whole cake:

- We set up the equation:
  \[
  \frac{9}{20} \times \text{hours} = 1
  \]

- Solving for hours, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{9}{20}\):
  \[

  \]

- \(\frac{20}{9}\) is approximately 2.22 hours.

Since the problem asks for the number of whole hours, we round up to the nearest whole number because they cannot complete the task in less than the required time. Therefore, they need to work for 3 hours together to earn enough for the cake.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C) 3 hours
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: C) 3 hours

Here's the reasoning process broken down:

1. **Determine Individual Rates**:
   - Sharon earns enough for a cake in 5 hours, so her rate is \(\frac{1}{5}\) of a cake per hour.
   - Karen earns enough for a cake in 4 hours, so her rate is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a cake per hour.

2. **Calculate Combined Rate**:
   - Add their rates: \(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}\).
   - Find a common denominator (20): \(\frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{20}\) and \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}\).
   - Combined rate: \(\frac{4}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{9}{20}\).

A)x > y
B)y^2 > x^2
C)-x^3 < y^2

1. \( x < 0 \)
2. \( y > 0 \)
3. \( |x^3| > |y^2| \)

Let's break down each part:

- Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^3 \) will also be negative because the cube of a negative number is negative. Therefore, \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).

- Since \( y > 0 \), \( y^2 \) will be positive, and thus \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

Given the inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \), we can substitute the expressions for the absolute values:

\[ -x^3 > y^2 \]

Now, let's evaluate each option:

**Option A: \( x > y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( x \) cannot be greater than \( y \). This option is false.

**Option B: \( y^2 > x^2 \)**

- We know \( -x^3 > y^2 \). However, this does not directly imply \( y^2 > x^2 \). We need more information about the relationship between \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) to conclude this. This option is not necessarily true.

**Option C: \( -x^3 < y^2 \)**

- This is the opposite of what we have from the inequality \( -x^3 > y^2 \). Therefore, this option is false.

**Option D: \( -x < y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \), \( -x \) is positive. We know \( -x^3 > y^2 \), which implies \( -x^3 \) is a larger positive number than \( y^2 \). However, this does not directly translate to \( -x < y \) without additional information. This option is not necessarily true.

**Option E: \( x < -y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( -y \) is negative. The condition \( x < -y \) is consistent with \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \) because \( x \) being negative and less than a negative number like \(-y\) is plausible. This option aligns with the given conditions.

After evaluating all options, the only statement that must be true given the conditions is:

**E) \( x < -y \)**

This is because \( x \) is negative and \( -y \) is also negative, and since \( y \) is positive, \( -y \) is less than zero, making it plausible for \( x \) to be less than \(-y\). Thus, the correct answer is:

To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given conditions and the inequality involving absolute values:

1. \( x < 0 \)
2. \( y > 0 \)

Let's break down the implications of these conditions:

- Since \( x < 0 \), the cube of \( x \) will also be negative, i.e., \( x^3 < 0 \). Therefore, the absolute value \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).

- Since \( y > 0 \), the square of \( y \) will be positive, i.e., \( y^2 > 0 \). Therefore, the absolute value \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

Given the inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \), we can substitute the expressions for the absolute values:

A)45
B)48
C)51
D)54
E)57",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how far ant A travels before meeting ant B. We know the following:

- Ant A's speed is 9 cm per hour.
- Ant B's speed is 6 cm per hour.
- The total distance between the two farms is 75 cm.

Since both ants are moving towards each other, we can calculate their combined speed by adding their individual speeds:

Combined speed = Speed of Ant A + Speed of Ant B = 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the two ants to meet. Since they are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 15 cm/hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed.

The distance they need to cover together is 75 cm, so:

Time = 75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours.

Now that we know it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet, we can calculate how far ant A travels in that time. Since ant A travels at a speed of 9 cm per hour, the distance ant A travels is:

Distance traveled by Ant A = Speed of Ant A × Time = 9 cm/hour × 5 hours = 45 cm.

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 45 cm.

A)9 Trousers
B)8 Trousers
C)10 Trousers
D)7 Trousers
E)11 Trousers",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trousers and shirts the man can buy with a total of Rs 810, given that trousers cost Rs 70 each and shirts cost Rs 30 each. We are specifically asked to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased:**
   - Each trouser costs Rs 70.
   - To find the maximum number of trousers, we divide the total amount of money (Rs 810) by the cost of one trouser (Rs 70).
   - \( \text{Maximum trousers} = \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \)
   - Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum whole number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the maximum number of trousers:**
   - If 11 trousers are purchased, the cost is \( 11 \times 70 = 770 \).
   - The remaining money is \( 810 - 770 = 40 \).

3. **Determine how many shirts can be purchased with the remaining money:**
   - Each shirt costs Rs 30.
   - With Rs 40 remaining, the number of shirts that can be purchased is \( \frac{40}{30} \approx 1.33 \).
   - Again, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a shirt, the maximum whole number of shirts that can be purchased is 1.

4. **Calculate the ratio of trousers to shirts:**
   - With 11 trousers and 1 shirt, the ratio of trousers to shirts is \( 11:1 \).

5. **Verify the options:**
   - The problem asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased, not the ratio itself.
   - The correct answer is the number of trousers, which is 11.

Therefore, the correct choice is:

E) 11 Trousers
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) 11 Trousers

The reasoning process involves calculating the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with the given budget, ensuring that the remaining money is used to buy as many shirts as possible. By dividing the total budget by the cost of one trouser, we determine that 11 trousers can be purchased. After buying 11 trousers, the remaining money allows for the purchase of 1 shirt.

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
     \[
     x = \frac{42}{0.75}
     \]
   - Calculating the division:
     \[
     x = 56
     \]
   - So, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.00.

4. **Finding the Cover Price Per Issue**:
   - Since $56.00 is the total cover price for 15 issues, the cover price per issue is:
     \[
     \text{Cover price per issue} = \frac{56}{15}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \text{Cover price per issue} = 3.7333\ldots

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
A)10
B)23
C)16
D)18
E)12",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the coin landed on heads given the conditions of the bets between Christopher and Jonathan.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin lands on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin lands on tails.

According to the problem:
1. The coin is flipped 20 times, so we have the equation:
   \[
   H + T = 20
   \]

2. Each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. Therefore, the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is \( 2H \).

3. Each time the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. Therefore, the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is \( 3T \).

4. At the end of the 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan has won or lost any money. This means the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan equals the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher:
   \[
   2H = 3T
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( H \) and \( T \).

From the second equation, express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[
T = \frac{2H}{3}
\]

Substitute \( T = \frac{2H}{3} \) into the first equation:
\[
H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{3H}{3} + \frac{2H}{3} = 20
\]

\[
\frac{5H}{3} = 20
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
5H = 60
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( H \):
\[
H = 12

Thus, the number of times the coin landed on heads is 12.

ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movements of Allen and Bob and determine the distance between X and Y based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from points X and Y, respectively.
   - Allen travels at 54 kmph, and Bob travels at 78 kmph.
   - They meet for the second time when Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.

2. **First Meeting:**
   - Let the distance between X and Y be \( D \) km.
   - When they first meet, the sum of the distances they have traveled is \( D \).
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time taken to meet for the first time.
   - Allen's distance = \( 54t_1 \)
   - Bob's distance = \( 78t_1 \)
   - \( 54t_1 + 78t_1 = D \)
   - \( 132t_1 = D \)
   - \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \)

3. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues towards Y and Bob towards X.
   - They meet again after both have turned around and are heading back towards their starting points.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time from the first meeting to the second meeting.
   - In this time, Allen travels \( 54t_2 \) and Bob travels \( 78t_2 \).
   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.
   - Total distance covered by Allen = \( 54(t_1 + t_2) \)
   - Total distance covered by Bob = \( 78(t_1 + t_2) \)
   - \( 78(t_1 + t_2) = 54(t_1 + t_2) + 48 \)
   - \( 24(t_1 + t_2) = 48 \)
   - \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \)

4. **Substitute \( t_1 \) and Solve for \( D \):**
   - We know \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \) and \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \).
   - Substitute \( t_1 \) into the equation:
   - \( \frac{D}{132} + t_2 = 2 \)
   - \( t_2 = 2 - \frac{D}{132} \)
   - Substitute \( t_2 \) back into the equation for the second meeting:
   - \( \frac{D}{132} + 2 - \frac{D}{132} = 2 \)
   - This confirms our equation is consistent.

5. **Calculate \( D \):**
   - From \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \), we have:
   - \( \frac{D}{132} + 2 - \frac{D}{132} = 2 \)
   - This simplifies to \( \frac{D}{132} = 1 \)

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the cost of repairing to the cost of purchasing new tires.

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - The cost of purchasing new tires is $180 per tire.
   - These new tires last for 4 years.
   - Therefore, the average cost per year for new tires is:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per year for new tires} = \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires:**
   - The cost of repairing current tires is $40 per tire.
   - The repair extends the life of the tires by 1 year.
   - Therefore, the average cost per year for repairing tires is:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per year for repairing tires} = \frac{40}{1} = 40 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Determine the percentage increase from repairing to purchasing new tires:**
   - The difference in cost per year between new tires and repaired tires is:
     \[
     45 - 40 = 5 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]
   - To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Difference in cost}}{\text{Cost of repairing}}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{5}{40}\right) \times 100\% = 12.5\%
     \]

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

175,,"Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on a bond with a principal amount of $5,000, an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded semi-annually, over a period of one year.

1. **Understand the Compounding Frequency**: The bond's interest is compounded every six months, which means there are 2 compounding periods in one year.

2. **Calculate the Periodic Interest Rate**: Since the annual interest rate is 12%, the interest rate for each six-month period is half of that:
   \[
   \text{Periodic Interest Rate} = \frac{12\%}{2} = 6\%
   \]

3. **Convert the Percentage to a Decimal**: To use the interest rate in calculations, convert it from a percentage to a decimal:
   \[
   6\% = 0.06
   \]

4. **Apply the Compound Interest Formula**: The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
   - \(P\) is the principal amount ($5,000).
   - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (decimal) (0.12).
   - \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (2).
   - \(t\) is the time the money is invested for in years (1).

5. **Plug in the Values**:
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2
   \]

6. **Calculate the Compound Interest**:
   \[
   A = 5000 \times 1.1236 = 5618
   \]

7. **Determine the Interest Accrued**: The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618
   \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618. The correct answer is (B) $618.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) $618.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed these steps:

1. **Compounding Frequency**: The bond compounds interest semi-annually, meaning there are 2 compounding periods in a year.

2. **Periodic Interest Rate**: The annual interest rate is 12%, so the semi-annual rate is half of that, which is 6% or 0.06 in decimal form.

3. **Compound Interest Formula**: I used the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where \(P = 5000\), \(r = 0.12\), \(n = 2\), and \(t = 1\).

4. **Plugging in Values**:
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} = 5000 \times (1.06)^2
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   \[
   A = 5000 \times 1.1236 = 5618
   \]

6. **Interest Accrued**: Subtract the principal from the total amount to find the interest:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 5618 - 5000 = 618
   \]

Thus, the interest accrued at maturity is $618, making the correct choice (B) $618.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)3400
B)1700
C)3440
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot. The key steps involve understanding the geometry of the problem and calculating the area of the boundary that needs to be gardened.

1. **Understanding the Perimeter**: 
   The problem states that the rectangular plot has a perimeter of 340 metres. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2(l + w)
   \]
   where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle. Given \( P = 340 \), we have:
   \[
   2(l + w) = 340 \implies l + w = 170
   \]

2. **Gardening Boundary**:
   The problem specifies a 1-metre broad boundary around the plot. This means the boundary forms a larger rectangle that is 1 metre wider on each side of the original rectangle. Therefore, the dimensions of the larger rectangle are:
   - Length of the larger rectangle = \( l + 2 \)
   - Width of the larger rectangle = \( w + 2 \)

3. **Area of the Boundary**:
   The area of the boundary is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original rectangle. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   - Area of the larger rectangle = \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \)
   - Area of the original rectangle = \( l \times w \)

   The area of the boundary is:
   \[
   (l + 2)(w + 2) - lw
   \]

4. **Expanding the Expression**:
   Expanding the expression for the area of the larger rectangle:
   \[
   (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4
   \]
   Therefore, the area of the boundary is:
   \[
   (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) - lw = 2l + 2w + 4
   \]

5. **Substituting Known Values**:
   We know from the perimeter equation that \( l + w = 170 \). Therefore:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 2 \times 170 = 340
   \]
   So, the area of the boundary is:
   \[
   340 + 4 = 344
   \]

6. **Calculating the Cost**:
   The cost of gardening is given at the rate of 10 per square metre. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   344 \times 10 = 3440
   \]

Thus, the cost of gardening the 1-metre broad boundary is 3440. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E)32000",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers the bee flies by in order to bypass 8 flowers, given that it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters.

First, let's understand what it means to bypass 0.05% of the flowers. If the bee flies by a certain number of flowers, say \( x \), then 0.05% of these flowers are bypassed. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Number of bypassed flowers} = 0.05\% \times x
\]

We are given that the bee bypasses 8 flowers. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.05\% \times x = 8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first convert the percentage to a decimal. The percentage 0.05% is equivalent to 0.0005 in decimal form. Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
0.0005 \times x = 8
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.0005:

\[
x = \frac{8}{0.0005}
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
x = \frac{8}{0.0005} = 8 \div 0.0005 = 16000

D) 16000  
E) 32000  

The correct answer is option D) 16000.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: D) 16000.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first understood that the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters. This means that for every 100 flowers the bee flies by, it bypasses 0.05 flowers. To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we set up the equation:

\[
0.05\% \times x = 8
\]

Converting 0.05% to a decimal gives us 0.0005. So the equation becomes:

\[
0.0005 \times x = 8
\]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.0005:

\[
x = \frac{8}{0.0005} = 8 \div 0.0005 = 16000

D)5C6*4C5
E)4C3*4C3",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how Fernando can allocate his 3 lunches and 3 dinners during the weekdays, given the constraints.

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so Fernando can only have meals from Monday to Friday.
   - Fernando goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he cannot have dinner at the cafeteria on Fridays.

2. **Lunch Allocation:**
   - Fernando has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to allocate his 3 lunches.
   - We need to choose 3 days out of these 5 days for lunch. This is a combination problem where we choose 3 days from 5, which is represented as \( \binom{5}{3} \).

3. **Dinner Allocation:**
   - Since Fernando goes home for dinner on Friday nights, he only has 4 days (Monday to Thursday) to allocate his 3 dinners.
   - We need to choose 3 days out of these 4 days for dinner. This is another combination problem where we choose 3 days from 4, which is represented as \( \binom{4}{3} \).

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Options:**
   - The total number of ways to allocate the lunches and dinners is the product of the two combinations: \( \binom{5}{3} \times \binom{4}{3} \).

5. **Evaluating the Options:**
   - \( \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 10 \)
   - \( \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4 \)
   - Therefore, the total number of options is \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \).

6. **Matching with the Given Choices:**
   - The correct choice that matches our calculation is \( \binom{5}{3} \times \binom{4}{3} \), which corresponds to option (A).

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) \( 5C3 \times 4C3 \)**.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) \( 5C3 \times 4C3 \).

Here's the reasoning process broken down:

1. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - Fernando can have meals only on weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - He cannot have dinner on Friday nights because he goes home.

2. **Lunch Allocation:**
   - There are 5 weekdays available for lunch.
   - Fernando needs to choose 3 days out of these 5 for lunch.
   - This is a combination problem: \( \binom{5}{3} \).

3. **Dinner Allocation:**
   - Since Friday night is not an option for dinner, only Monday to Thursday are available.
   - Fernando needs to choose 3 days out of these 4 for dinner.
   - This is another combination problem: \( \binom{4}{3} \).

4. **Total Options Calculation:**
   - The total number of ways to allocate the meals is the product of the two combinations: \( \binom{5}{3} \times \binom{4}{3} \).

5. **Computation:**
   - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (calculated as \( \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \))
   - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (calculated as \( \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \))

A)(a + b)(a - b)
B)(a - b)2
C)(a + b)2
D)a3 + b3
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve the given problem, we need to simplify the expression on the left side of the equation and compare it to the expression on the right side.

The expression given is:

\[
\frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2} = (a - b)^2
\]

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

1. Recognize that \(a^2 - b^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:

   \[
   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
   \]

2. Substitute this factorization into the expression:

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)^2}
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factor \((a + b)\) in the numerator and the denominator:

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b}
   \]

Now, compare this simplified expression to the right side of the equation, which is \((a - b)^2\).

The expression \((a - b)^2\) is equivalent to:

\[
(a - b)(a - b)
\]

For the equation to hold true, the simplified left side \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) must equal \((a - b)(a - b)\). However, this is not possible because:

- \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) is a single fraction, while \((a - b)(a - b)\) is a product of two identical terms.

Thus, the left side does not simplify to the right side as given in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options that suggest equality.

The correct choice is:

\[
\text{E) None of these}
\]

This is because the simplification of the left side does not match the expression on the right side, and none of the given options correctly represent the relationship.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: E) None of these

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Identify the Expression**: We start with the expression \(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\).

2. **Factor the Numerator**: Recognize that \(a^2 - b^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((a - b)(a + b)\).

3. **Substitute the Factorization**: Replace \(a^2 - b^2\) with \((a - b)(a + b)\) in the expression:

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)^2}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Fraction**: Cancel out the common factor \((a + b)\) from the numerator and the denominator:

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b}
   \]

5. **Compare with the Right Side**: The right side of the equation is \((a - b)^2\), which is equivalent to \((a - b)(a - b)\).

6. **Evaluate the Equality**: For the equation to hold true, \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) must equal \((a - b)(a - b)\). However, this is not possible because:

   - \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) is a single fraction, while \((a - b)(a - b)\) is a product of two identical terms.

7. **Conclusion**: The simplified left side does not match the right side. Therefore, none of the given options (A, B, C, D) correctly represent the relationship.

Thus, the correct answer is E) None of these, as the simplification does not equate to the expression on the right side.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)60
B)56
C)51
D)61
E)41",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find a number that is equally distant from 36 and 86. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**
   - We are looking for a number, let's call it \( x \).
   - The number \( x \) is ""as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86.""

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The phrase ""as much greater than 36"" means the difference between \( x \) and 36 is \( x - 36 \).
   - The phrase ""as it is less than 86"" means the difference between 86 and \( x \) is \( 86 - x \).
   - According to the problem, these two differences are equal:
     \[
     x - 36 = 86 - x
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Start by adding \( x \) to both sides to eliminate the negative \( x \) on the right:
     \[
     x - 36 + x = 86 - x + x
     \]
     \[
     2x - 36 = 86
     \]
   - Next, add 36 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x - 36 + 36 = 86 + 36
     \]
     \[
     2x = 122
     \]
   - Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{122}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 61
     \]

4. **Verification:**
   - Check if 61 is indeed as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86:
     - \( 61 - 36 = 25 \)
     - \( 86 - 61 = 25 \)
   - Both differences are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number that satisfies the condition given in the problem is 61.

Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{61} \), which corresponds to option (D).

The reasoning process involves setting up an equation based on the condition that the number is equally distant from 36 and 86. By solving the equation \( x - 36 = 86 - x \), we find that \( x = 61 \). Verification confirms that 61 is indeed 25 units greater than 36 and 25 units less than 86, satisfying the problem's condition. Thus, the correct answer is option (D) 61.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

185,,"A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
A)20 min
B)22 min
C)23 min
D)21 min
E)20 min",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for A and B to construct the wall together. We know the individual times it takes for each person to complete the task alone:

- A can construct the wall in 40 minutes.
- B can construct the wall in 45 minutes.

First, we calculate the rate at which each person works. The rate is the reciprocal of the time it takes to complete the task:

- A's rate of work is \( \frac{1}{40} \) of the wall per minute.
- B's rate of work is \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

When A and B work together, their rates of work add up. Therefore, the combined rate of work is:

\[
\frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360. We convert each rate to have this common denominator:

- A's rate: \( \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360} \)
- B's rate: \( \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360} \)

Adding these rates together gives:

\[
\frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360}
\]

This combined rate of \( \frac{17}{360} \) means that together, A and B can construct \( \frac{17}{360} \) of the wall per minute. To find out how long it takes them to construct the entire wall, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{360}{17} \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{360}{17} \) gives approximately 21.1765 minutes. Since we are looking for the closest whole number in the options provided, we round this to 21 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER_AS_LETTER: D) 21 min

To solve the problem, we first determined the individual work rates of A and B, which are \( \frac{1}{40} \) and \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute, respectively. By adding these rates, we found the combined work rate of A and B working together, which is \( \frac{17}{360} \) of the wall per minute. To find the total time required to complete the wall together, we took the reciprocal of the combined rate, resulting in \( \frac{360}{17} \) minutes, which is approximately 21.1765 minutes. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we determined that the time needed is 21 minutes. Thus, the correct answer is option D) 21 min.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel, given the speed of the train and the length of the tunnel.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.
   - The tunnel is 1 mile long.
   - The train travels at 120 miles per hour.

2. **Convert Speed to Consistent Units:**
   - The train's speed is given in miles per hour, but we need to work in seconds since the time to enter the tunnel is given in seconds.
   - Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second:
     \[
     120 \text{ miles per hour} = \frac{120}{3600} \text{ miles per second} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Train:**
   - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means the entire length of the train passes a single point (the entrance of the tunnel) in 3 seconds.
   - In 3 seconds, the train travels:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}

   - Therefore, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.

4. **Calculate Total Time to Pass Through the Tunnel:**
   - To completely pass through the tunnel, the train must travel its own length plus the length of the tunnel.
   - Total distance to travel = Length of the train + Length of the tunnel = \(\frac{1}{10} + 1 = \frac{11}{10}\) miles.

A)247.67
B)237.67
C)227.67
D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the terms of the invoice and how they relate to the discount and interest rate.

The invoice terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

1. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   - The original invoice amount is $20,000.
   - A 4% discount on $20,000 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800
     \]
   - Therefore, the discounted price is:
     \[
     20,000 - 800 = 19,200
     \]

2. **Determine the Savings from the Discount:**
   - By paying $19,200 within 30 days, the merchant saves $800 compared to paying the full $20,000 after 100 days.

3. **Calculate the Effective Interest Rate:**
   - The merchant is essentially borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (the difference between 100 days and 30 days) to save $800.
   - We need to find the simple interest rate that equates to saving $800 over 70 days on a principal of $19,200.

4. **Use the Simple Interest Formula:**
   - The simple interest formula is:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{\text{Time}}{365}
     \]
   - Here, the interest is $800, the principal is $19,200, and the time is 70 days.
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest} \times 365}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Rate:**
   - Perform the calculations:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{292,000}{1,344,000} \approx 0.217
     \]
   - Convert the rate to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Rate} \approx 21.7\%
     \]

6. **Compare with the Given Options:**
   - The calculated rate of approximately 21.7% does not match any of the given options directly. However, the problem asks for the ""highest simple interest rate"" at which the merchant can afford to borrow money. This suggests that the options might be misinterpreted or misrepresented.

7. **Re-evaluate the Options:**
   - The options provided (A) 247.67, (B) 237.67, (C) 227.67, (D) 215.67, (E) None of these, seem to be much higher than the calculated rate.

A)6.5
B)7.5
C)7
D)6
E)None of the above",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio and how it relates to the actual quantities of rice, wheat, and corn in the cereal mixture.

The problem states that the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

We are also told that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the value of one part in terms of pounds:

- Let \( x \) be the weight of one part in pounds.
- According to the ratio, 2 parts of rice correspond to 3 pounds.

Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x = 3 \]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \]

Now that we know each part is 1.5 pounds, we can find out how much corn is in the mixture. The ratio tells us there are 5 parts of corn.

Therefore, the weight of the corn is:
\[ 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \]

Thus, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

The correct answer is (B) 7.5.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 7.5.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first analyzed the given ratio of rice, wheat, and corn, which is 2:3:5. This ratio indicates that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn in the mixture.

Given that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, we set up a proportion to determine the weight of one part in the ratio. Since 2 parts of rice correspond to 3 pounds, we can express this relationship as:

\[ 2x = 3 \]

Solving for \( x \), which represents the weight of one part, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \]

This calculation tells us that each part in the ratio corresponds to 1.5 pounds. With this information, we can determine the weight of the corn in the mixture. The ratio specifies that there are 5 parts of corn, so we calculate the weight of the corn as follows:

\[ 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \]

Thus, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn, making the correct answer (B) 7.5.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)500
B)600
C)750
D)800
E)900",E,"ANSWER_1: 
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given and then solve for the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the cost of one soda in cents.
- \( e \) as the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations based on the purchases:

1. One soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents:
   \[
   s + 2e = 150
   \]

2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents:
   \[
   2s + 3e = 300
   \]

We need to solve this system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

First, let's solve the first equation for \( s \):
\[
s = 150 - 2e
\]

Substitute this expression for \( s \) into the second equation:
\[
2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300
\]

Simplify and solve for \( e \):
\[
300 - 4e + 3e = 300
\]
\[
300 - e = 300
\]
\[
-e = 0
\]
\[
e = 0
\]

Now substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the equation for \( s \):
\[
s = 150 - 2(0) = 150
\]

So, the cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents.

Now, we need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:
\[
6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900
\]

Therefore, the cost in cents of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents.

The correct answer is:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.
   - Each pen is sold at Rs. 10.
   - 10% of the pens produced are defective and rejected before packing.
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - The company delivers 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue from these pens is:
     \[
     7200 \times 10 = Rs. 72,000
     \]

3. **Determine the Total Number of Pens Produced:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, the 7200 pens represent 90% of the total pens produced.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens produced. Then:
     \[
     0.9x = 7200
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]
   - Therefore, the company produces 8000 pens in total.

4. **Calculate the Total Cost of Manufacturing:**
   - The company makes a 25% profit on the total cost of manufacturing all pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of manufacturing all 8000 pens.
   - The profit is 25% of the cost, so the revenue is 125% of the cost:
     \[
     1.25C = 72,000
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{72,000}{1.25} = 57,600
     \]

5. **Determine the Manufacturing Cost per Pen:**
   - The total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens is Rs. 57,600.
   - Therefore, the cost per pen is:

A)12
B)24
C)42
D)48
E)49",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to translate the given conditions into mathematical equations and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote the digit in the ten's place as \( x \) and the digit in the unit's place as \( y \). Since the number is a two-digit number, it can be expressed as \( 10x + y \).

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. This can be written as:
\[ 10x + y = (x + y) + 18 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ 10x + y = x + y + 18 \]
\[ 10x + y - x - y = 18 \]
\[ 9x = 18 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Now that we know \( x = 2 \), we can use the second condition: the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. This means:
\[ y = 2x \]

Substituting \( x = 2 \) into this equation gives:
\[ y = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is 4. Therefore, the number is:
\[ 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 24.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 24.

To solve the problem, we first set up the equations based on the conditions given:

1. Let \( x \) be the digit in the ten's place and \( y \) be the digit in the unit's place. The two-digit number can be expressed as \( 10x + y \).

2. The problem states that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
   \[
   10x + y = (x + y) + 18
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   10x + y = x + y + 18
   \]
   \[
   10x + y - x - y = 18
   \]
   \[
   9x = 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

3. The second condition is that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place:
   \[
   y = 2x
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 2 \) into this equation:
   \[
   y = 2 \times 2 = 4

E)None",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expressions \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \) and determine the relationship between them for any two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

1. **Understanding the Floor Function**:
   - The notation \([x]\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). For example, \([3.7] = 3\) and \([-1.2] = -2\).

2. **Expression for \( L(x, y) \)**:
   - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \).
   - Here, \([x]\) and \([y]\) are the greatest integers less than or equal to \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.
   - \([x + y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to the sum \( x + y \).

3. **Expression for \( R(x, y) \)**:
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \).
   - \([2x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( 2x \).
   - \([2y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( 2y \).

4. **Analyzing the Relationship**:
   - We need to compare \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \).
   - Notice that \( [x + y] \leq [x] + [y] \) because the floor of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of the floors.
   - Therefore, \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \leq [x] + [y] + ([x] + [y]) = 2[x] + 2[y] \).

5. **Comparing with \( R(x, y) \)**:
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \).
   - Since \([2x] \geq 2[x]\) and \([2y] \geq 2[y]\), it follows that \( R(x, y) \geq 2[x] + 2[y] \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - From the above, \( L(x, y) \leq 2[x] + 2[y] \leq R(x, y) \).
   - Therefore, \( L(x, y) \leq R(x, y) \) for any positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

7. **Determining the Impossible Condition**:
   - Since \( L(x, y) \leq R(x, y) \) always holds, it is impossible for \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \).

Thus, the correct answer is that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) for which:

**C) \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \)**

Let's break down the process to find the LCM of these three numbers:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
   - 40 = 2^3 * 5
   - 48 = 2^4 * 3

2. **Determine the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 5.

   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is 2^4 (from 48).
   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is 3^2 (from 36).
   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is 5^1 (from 40).

3. **Calculate the LCM:**

The electric pole and its shadow form one right triangle, and the tree and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

Let's denote:
- \( h_1 = 14 \) meters as the height of the electric pole.
- \( s_1 = 10 \) meters as the length of the shadow of the electric pole.
- \( h_2 \) as the height of the tree, which we need to find.
- \( s_2 = 15 \) meters as the length of the shadow of the tree.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the pole should be equal to the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the tree. This gives us the proportion:

\[
\frac{h_1}{s_1} = \frac{h_2}{s_2}

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
\frac{14}{10} = \frac{h_2}{15}

D)70 kmph
E)80 kmph",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours and then calculate the gain in speed compared to the original speed.

1. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hr = 1200 km.

2. **Determine the Required Speed for 10 Hours:**

If we were to choose based on the closest logical interpretation, none of the options match the calculated gain. Therefore, the problem might need revisiting for clarity or correction in the options.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Upon reviewing the problem and the calculations, it seems there is a discrepancy between the calculated gain in speed and the options provided. Let's go through the reasoning process again to ensure accuracy:

1. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hr = 1200 km.

2. **Determine the Required Speed for 10 Hours:**
   - To cover the same distance (1200 km) in 10 hours, the required speed is:
   - Required Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 km / 10 hr = 120 km/hr.

3. **Calculate the Gain in Speed:**
   - The original speed was 60 km/hr.
   - The new required speed is 120 km/hr.
   - Gain in Speed = New Speed - Original Speed = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

4. **Check the Options:**
   - The calculated gain in speed is 60 km/hr.
   - However, none of the options (A) 80 kmph, (B) 50 kmph, (C) 120 kmph, (D) 70 kmph, (E) 80 kmph directly match this result.

If we were to choose based on the closest logical interpretation, none of the options match the calculated gain. Therefore, the problem might need revisiting for clarity or correction in the options. 

In conclusion, the correct answer based on the calculations is 60 km/hr, but since this is not an option, it indicates a potential error in the problem's provided choices.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
199,,"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
A)1/18
B)1/9
C)23/90
D)5/18
E)13/45",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, as Roger's method involves cheating.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Alan's Probability**: Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Roger's Probability**: Roger cheats, so we do not consider his probability for this problem since we are looking for non-cheating correct answers.

3. **Peter's Probability**: Peter calculates the answer, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

Now, we need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger. Since Roger's method involves cheating, we exclude his probability from our calculations.

The probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter (or both) is calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events:

\[ P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = P(\text{Correct by Alan}) + P(\text{Correct by Peter}) - P(\text{Correct by both Alan and Peter}) \]

Since Alan and Peter are independent in their methods:

- \( P(\text{Correct by Alan}) = \frac{1}{5} \)
- \( P(\text{Correct by Peter}) = \frac{5}{6} \)
- \( P(\text{Correct by both Alan and Peter}) = P(\text{Correct by Alan}) \times P(\text{Correct by Peter}) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30.

Convert each fraction:

- \( \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{30} \)
- \( \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{30} \)
- \( \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{30} \)

Now substitute back into the equation:

\[ P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} - \frac{5}{30} \]

\[ = \frac{6 + 25 - 5}{30} \]

\[ = \frac{26}{30} \]

Simplify \( \frac{26}{30} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[ = \frac{13}{15} \]

However, this is the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, including the possibility of both answering correctly. We need to ensure that this probability does not include any overlap with Roger's cheating, but since we are explicitly excluding Roger's probability, this calculation is correct.

Thus, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \( \frac{13}{15} \).

A)10%
B)12%
C)6%
D)8%
E)4%",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) and how they differ over a period of time. The problem states that the difference between the simple interest and compound interest on Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72. We need to find the rate of interest.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Formulae:**
   - Simple Interest (SI) for 2 years is given by:
     \[
     \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
     \]
     where \( P \) is the principal amount, \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum, and \( T \) is the time in years.

   - Compound Interest (CI) for 2 years is given by:
     \[
     \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P
     \]

2. **Given Values:**
   - Principal \( P = 5000 \)
   - Time \( T = 2 \) years
   - Difference between CI and SI = Rs. 72

3. **Calculate Simple Interest for 2 years:**
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 100R
   \]

4. **Calculate Compound Interest for 2 years:**
   \[
   \text{CI} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000
   \]

5. **Difference between CI and SI:**
   \[
   \text{CI} - \text{SI} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72
   \]

6. **Simplify the CI expression:**
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}
   \]
   \[
   \text{CI} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}\right) - 5000
   \]
   \[
   = 5000 \left(\frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}\right)
   \]
   \[
   = 100R + \frac{5000R^2}{10000}
   \]
   \[
   = 100R + \frac{R^2}{2}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the difference:**
   \[
   \left(100R + \frac{R^2}{2}\right) - 100R = 72
   \]
   \[
   \frac{R^2}{2} = 72
   \]
   \[
   R^2 = 144
   \]
   \[
   R = \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The rate of interest is 12%.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(B) 12%**.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 12%.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach to understand the relationship between simple interest and compound interest over a period of time. By setting up the equations for both types of interest and using the given difference between them, we derived the rate of interest. The calculations showed that the rate of interest that satisfies the condition of the problem is 12%.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
201,,"All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given and use it to set up equations that will help us find the number of files not infected by a worm.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( V \) be the number of files infected by a virus.
- Let \( W \) be the number of files infected by a worm.
- Let \( B \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of files is 250.
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be expressed as \( W - B = 2.5B \).

We need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. This is equivalent to finding the number of files infected only by a virus.

Let's break down the equations:
- The number of files infected only by a virus is \( V - B \).
- The number of files infected only by a worm is \( W - B \).
- The number of files infected by both is \( B \).

From the equation \( W - B = 2.5B \), we can solve for \( W \):
\[ W - B = 2.5B \]
\[ W = 3.5B \]

Now, we know the total number of files is 250, so:
\[ V + (W - B) = 250 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 125 + (3.5B - B) = 250 \]
\[ 125 + 2.5B = 250 \]
\[ 2.5B = 250 - 125 \]
\[ 2.5B = 125 \]
\[ B = \frac{125}{2.5} \]
\[ B = 50 \]

Now that we have \( B = 50 \), we can find \( W \):
\[ W = 3.5B = 3.5 \times 50 = 175 \]

Finally, the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by a virus:
\[ V - B = 125 - 50 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is 75.

The correct answer is \( \boxed{75} \).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Sam's files were not infected by a worm. Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - \( V \): Number of files infected by a virus.
   - \( W \): Number of files infected by a worm.
   - \( B \): Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Total files = 250.
   - 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, meaning 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
   - The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be expressed as \( W - B = 2.5B \).

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the equation \( W - B = 2.5B \), we can solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W - B = 2.5B \implies W = 3.5B
     \]

4. **Total Files Equation:**
   - The total number of files is the sum of files infected only by a virus, only by a worm, and by both:
     \[
     (V - B) + (W - B) + B = 250
     \]
   - Substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \):
     \[
     (125 - B) + (3.5B - B) + B = 250
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     125 - B + 2.5B = 250
     \]
     \[
     125 + 1.5B = 250
     \]
     \[
     1.5B = 250 - 125
     \]
     \[
     1.5B = 125
     \]
     \[
     B = \frac{125}{1.5} = \frac{250}{3} \approx 83.33
     \]

   However, this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

   - Correct the equation:
     \[
     2.5B = 125
     \]
     \[
     B = \frac{125}{2.5} = 50

5. **Calculate \( W \):**
   - Using \( B = 50 \):
     \[
     W = 3.5 \times 50 = 175
     \]

6. **Files Not Infected by a Worm:**
   - Files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus:
     \[
     V - B = 125 - 50 = 75

A)2400
B)2500
C)2600
D)2700
E)None of these",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the Rs. 5100 should be given to Mohan so that when both Mohan and Sohan invest their shares at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will have equal amounts when they both turn 26 years old.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Current Ages and Time to Maturity:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will invest his share for 3 years (until he turns 26).
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will invest his share for 2 years (until he turns 26).

2. **Compound Interest Formula:**
   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) years, \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment), \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( n \) is the number of years.

3. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be Mohan's share. Then Sohan's share will be \( 5100 - x \).
   - Mohan's amount after 3 years will be:
     \[
     A_M = x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = x \times 1.124864
     \]
   - Sohan's amount after 2 years will be:
     \[
     A_S = (5100 - x) \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2 = (5100 - x) \times 1.0816
     \]

4. **Equating the Amounts:**
   Since both amounts should be equal when they turn 26, we set:
   \[
   x \times 1.124864 = (5100 - x) \times 1.0816
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   1.124864x = 5512.16 - 1.0816x
   \]
   \[
   1.124864x + 1.0816x = 5512.16
   \]
   \[
   2.206464x = 5512.16
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{5512.16}{2.206464} \approx 2500
   \]

Thus, Mohan's share should be approximately Rs. 2500.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2500.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 2500.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Mohan and Sohan need to have equal amounts when they both turn 26.
   - Mohan invests for 3 years, and Sohan invests for 2 years.

2. **Using the Compound Interest Formula:**
   - We applied the compound interest formula to determine the future value of their investments.

3. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - We set up equations for the future values of Mohan's and Sohan's investments and equated them to ensure they are equal at age 26.

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - By solving the equation, we determined Mohan's share to be Rs. 2500.

A)y/(1200xy)
B)20xy/w
C)5xy/(12w)
D)w/(3xy)
E)3y/(wx)",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes it will take for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain, given that the liquid passes through at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.

First, let's understand the rate of flow:
- The rate of flow is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds.

To find the rate in terms of gallons per second, we divide the amount of gallons by the time in seconds:
- Rate in gallons per second = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.

Next, we need to find out how many seconds it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain at this rate:
- Time in seconds = Total gallons / Rate in gallons per second = y / (w/(25x)) = (25xy)/w seconds.

Since the problem asks for the time in minutes, we need to convert seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the time in seconds by 60 to convert it to minutes:
- Time in minutes = (25xy)/w / 60 = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.

Now, let's match this result with the given options:
- A) y/(1200xy)
- B) 20xy/w
- C) 5xy/(12w)
- D) w/(3xy)

The correct answer is option C) 5xy/(12w), which matches our calculated time in minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 5xy/(12w).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: C) 5xy/(12w).

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed these steps:

1. **Understand the rate of flow**: The problem states that the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. To express this rate in terms of gallons per second, we divide the number of gallons by the number of seconds: 
   \[
   \text{Rate in gallons per second} = \frac{w/25}{x} = \frac{w}{25x}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time in seconds for y gallons**: To find out how many seconds it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time in seconds} = \frac{\text{Total gallons}}{\text{Rate in gallons per second}} = \frac{y}{w/(25x)} = \frac{25xy}{w}
   \]

3. **Convert seconds to minutes**: Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{25xy}{w} \times \frac{1}{60} = \frac{25xy}{60w} = \frac{5xy}{12w}

205,,"A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Composition of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver.
   - The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - The total weight of the coin is 30 grams.

2. **Determine the Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness (height) of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm.
   - The radius of the coin is half of the diameter, which is 7.5 mm.
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula: 
     \[
     V = \pi r^2 h
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

3. **Determine the Volume of Each Metal in the Alloy:**
   - Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, each metal occupies half of the total volume.
   - Therefore, the volume of aluminum \( V_{Al} \) and the volume of silver \( V_{Ag} \) are:
     \[
     V_{Al} = V_{Ag} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

4. **Determine the Density and Weight of Each Metal:**
   - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_{Al} \) and the density of silver be \( \rho_{Ag} \).
   - Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we have:
     \[
     \rho_{Ag} = 2\rho_{Al}
     \]
   - The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so:
     \[
     \rho_{Al} \times V_{Al} + \rho_{Ag} \times V_{Ag} = 30
     \]
   - Substituting \( V_{Al} = V_{Ag} = 56.25\pi \) and \( \rho_{Ag} = 2\rho_{Al} \), we get:
     \[
     \rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi = 30
     \]
     \[
     3\rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi = 30
     \]
     \[
     \rho_{Al} = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Weight of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum and measures 1 mm in thickness and 30 mm in diameter.
   - The radius of the new coin is 15 mm.
   - The volume \( V_{new} \) of the new coin is:
     \[
     V_{new} = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]
   - The weight \( W_{new} \) of the new coin is:
     \[
     W_{new} = \rho_{Al} \times V_{new} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi
     \]
     \[
     W_{new} = \frac{10 \times 225\pi}{56.25\pi} = \frac{2250}{56.25} = 40 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams. The correct answer is:

**B) 40 grams**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a new coin made of pure aluminum, given the properties of an original coin made of an alloy of aluminum and silver. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Original Coin Composition:**
   - The original coin is made of an alloy with equal volumes of aluminum and silver.
   - The total weight of the original coin is 30 grams.

2. **Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm.
   - The radius is half of the diameter, so \( r = 7.5 \) mm.
   - The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

3. **Volume of Each Metal in the Alloy:**
   - Since the volumes of aluminum and silver are equal, each occupies half of the total volume:
     \[
     V_{Al} = V_{Ag} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

4. **Density and Weight of Each Metal:**
   - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_{Al} \) and the density of silver be \( \rho_{Ag} \).
   - Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so \( \rho_{Ag} = 2\rho_{Al} \).
   - The total weight equation is:
     \[
     \rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi = 30
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     3\rho_{Al} \times 56.25\pi = 30
     \]
     \[
     \rho_{Al} = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi}
     \]

5. **Weight of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum, with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 30 mm.
   - The radius is 15 mm, so the volume \( V_{new} \) is:
     \[
     V_{new} = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]
   - The weight \( W_{new} \) of the new coin is:
     \[
     W_{new} = \rho_{Al} \times V_{new} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi
     \]
     \[
     W_{new} = \frac{10 \times 225\pi}{56.25\pi} = \frac{2250}{56.25} = 40 \text{ grams}

A)100
B)160
C)150
D)210
E)220",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve the problem, we need to translate the word problem into a mathematical equation and then solve for the unknown number.

1. **Identify the unknown**: Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \).

2. **Translate the problem into an equation**:
   - ""2/3 of a number"" translates to \( \frac{2}{3}x \).
   - ""10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number"" translates to \( \frac{2}{3}x - 10 \).
   - ""The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number"" translates to \( 40 + \frac{1}{3}x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
   \]

4. **Solve the equation**:
   - First, eliminate the fractions by multiplying every term by 3 to clear the denominators:
     \[
     3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2x - 30 = 120 + x
     \]

   - Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     2x - x - 30 = 120
     \]
     Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     x - 30 = 120
     \]

   - Add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 120 + 30
     \]
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the original conditions to ensure it satisfies the problem:
     - Calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \).
     - Subtract 10 from this result: \( 100 - 10 = 90 \).
     - Calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50 \).
     - Add 40 to this result: \( 50 + 40 = 90 \).

   Both sides of the equation equal 90, confirming that our solution is correct.

Therefore, the number is \( \boxed{150} \), which corresponds to option (C).

D)8
E)12",C,"ANSWER_1: To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\) will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0

In the given equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We need this discriminant to be greater than zero for the roots to be real and distinct:

\[
25 - 4k > 0

Solving this inequality for \(k\), we subtract 25 from both sides:

\[
-4k > -25
\]

Next, divide both sides by -4, remembering to reverse the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative number:

\[
k < \frac{25}{4}

Calculating \(\frac{25}{4}\), we get:

\[
\frac{25}{4} = 6.25

A)9 hours.
B)10 hours.
C)11 hours.
D)12 hours.
E)13 hours.",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km, considering both her riding speed and her rest periods.

1. **Calculate the Riding Time:**
   - Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour.
   - To cover 100 km without any breaks, the time taken would be:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Rest Breaks:**
   - Shweta takes a rest every 15 km.
   - To find out how many complete 15 km segments are in 100 km, we divide 100 by 15:
     \[
     \frac{100}{15} \approx 6.67
     \]
   - This means she completes 6 full 15 km segments and starts a 7th segment but does not complete it.

3. **Calculate the Rest Time:**
   - Shweta rests for 10 minutes at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - Since she completes 6 full segments, she will take 6 rest breaks.
   - Each rest break is 10 minutes, so the total rest time is:
     \[
     6 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the riding time and the rest time:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 10 \text{ hours (riding)} + 1 \text{ hour (rest)} = 11 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11 hours.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (C) 11 hours.

To arrive at this conclusion, we first calculated the time Shweta would take to ride 100 km at her speed of 10 km per hour, which is 10 hours. Then, we determined how many rest breaks she would take by dividing the total distance by the distance she covers before each rest, which is 15 km. This resulted in 6 complete rest breaks, each lasting 10 minutes, totaling 60 minutes or 1 hour of rest. Adding the riding time and the rest time gives us a total of 11 hours.

A)22 hrs
B)18 hrs
C)16 hrs
D)20 hrs
E)13 hrs",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it would take for Mr. Sam to travel both ways by car, given the information about his travel times by train and car.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go to a certain city by train and return by car.
2. If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the train-car combination.

From point 2, we can deduce that the round trip by train takes 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the time taken to travel one way by train.
- \( C \) as the time taken to travel one way by car.

From the information given:
- The round trip by train takes 21 hours, so \( 2T = 21 \). Therefore, \( T = 10.5 \) hours.
- The train-car combination takes 17 hours, so \( T + C = 17 \).

Now, we know \( T = 10.5 \) hours. Substituting this into the equation \( T + C = 17 \):

\[ 10.5 + C = 17 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 \]

So, the time taken to travel one way by car is 6.5 hours.

Finally, to find the time taken if Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car, we calculate:

\[ 2C = 2 \times 6.5 = 13 \]

Therefore, if Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car, it would take him 13 hours.

The correct answer is (E) 13 hrs.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (E) 13 hrs.

To arrive at this conclusion, we carefully analyzed the information given in the problem and set up equations to represent the travel times. By defining \( T \) as the time for one-way travel by train and \( C \) as the time for one-way travel by car, we used the given conditions to form two equations:

1. The round trip by train takes 21 hours, leading to \( 2T = 21 \), which simplifies to \( T = 10.5 \) hours.
2. The train-car combination takes 17 hours, giving us \( T + C = 17 \).

Substituting \( T = 10.5 \) into the second equation, we solved for \( C \):

\[ 10.5 + C = 17 \]
\[ C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 \]

Thus, the time for one-way travel by car is 6.5 hours. To find the total time for a round trip by car, we calculated:

\[ 2C = 2 \times 6.5 = 13 \]

This confirms that the time taken if Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car would be 13 hours, making option (E) the correct choice.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **8:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) of the original amount.

2. **9:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 2/3 of the original food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the original amount.

3. **10:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 4/9 of the original food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (4/9) = 8/27 of the original amount.

4. **11:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 8/27 of the original food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (8/27) = 16/81 of the original amount.

B)120
C)50
D)200
E)80",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who took the survey based on the information given about the preferences of men.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - 60% of the survey participants were women.
   - 40% of the survey participants were men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).
   - Of the men, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.
   - 10 men preferred green cars over red cars.

2. **Analyzing the Men's Preferences:**
   - If 75% of the men preferred red cars, then 25% of the men preferred green cars (since 100% - 75% = 25%).
   - We know that 10 men preferred green cars, which represents 25% of the total number of men surveyed.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Men:**
   - Let \( M \) be the total number of men surveyed.
   - Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we have:
     \[
     0.25M = 10
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \), we divide both sides by 0.25:
     \[
     M = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40

   - Therefore, there were 40 men surveyed.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of People Surveyed:**
   - Since men make up 40% of the total survey participants, and we have found there are 40 men, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.40 \times \text{Total People} = 40
     \]
   - Solving for the total number of people surveyed:
     \[
     \text{Total People} = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100

   - We know that 10 men preferred green cars, which represents 25% of the men surveyed.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Men:**
   - Let \( M \) be the total number of men surveyed.
   - Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we have the equation:
     \[
     0.25M = 10
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \), we divide both sides by 0.25:
     \[
     M = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, there were 40 men surveyed.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of People Surveyed:**
   - Since men make up 40% of the total survey participants, and we have found there are 40 men, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.40 \times \text{Total People} = 40
     \]
   - Solving for the total number of people surveyed:
     \[
     \text{Total People} = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of people who took the survey is 100.

213,,"How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time?
A)88
B)89
C)90
D)91
E)92",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways the boy can reach the top of a staircase with 10 steps, given that he can take either one step or two steps at a time. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the Fibonacci sequence.

Here's the reasoning process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The boy can take either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. We need to find out how many different combinations of 1-step and 2-step moves will allow him to reach exactly 10 steps.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If there is 1 step, there is only 1 way to reach it: a single 1-step move.
   - If there are 2 steps, there are 2 ways to reach it: either two 1-step moves or one 2-step move.

3. **Recursive Relation**: 
   - For any step `n`, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the ways to reach the previous step (`n-1`) and the ways to reach the step before that (`n-2`). This is because the boy can reach step `n` by taking a 1-step from `n-1` or a 2-step from `n-2`.
   - This gives us the relation: `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**: 
   - The problem is equivalent to finding the (n+1)th Fibonacci number, where `n` is the number of steps. This is because the Fibonacci sequence is defined as `F(1) = 1`, `F(2) = 2`, and `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` for `n > 2`.

5. **Calculate for 10 Steps**:
   - We need to find `ways(10)`, which corresponds to `F(11)` in the Fibonacci sequence.
   - Let's calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to `F(11)`:
     - `F(1) = 1`
     - `F(2) = 2`
     - `F(3) = 3` (1+2)
     - `F(4) = 5` (2+3)
     - `F(5) = 8` (3+5)
     - `F(6) = 13` (5+8)
     - `F(7) = 21` (8+13)
     - `F(8) = 34` (13+21)
     - `F(9) = 55` (21+34)
     - `F(10) = 89` (34+55)
     - `F(11) = 144` (55+89)

6. **Conclusion**: The number of ways to reach the 10th step is `F(11) = 89`.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 89.

214,,"IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
A)0.5
B)1
C)1.25
D)1.5
E)2",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to a 1-gallon mixture of 40% orange juice and 60% water to make the orange juice content 60% of the total mixture.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Composition**: 
   - The initial 1-gallon mixture contains 40% orange juice and 60% water.
   - This means there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water in the mixture.

2. **Goal**:
   - We want the final mixture to be 60% orange juice.

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional gallons of orange juice to be added.
   - After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice in the mixture will be \( 0.4 + x \) gallons.
   - The total volume of the mixture will be \( 1 + x \) gallons (since we are adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice to the original 1 gallon).

4. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture:
   \[
   \frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
   \]
   - Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
   \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
   \]
   \[
   0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
   \]
   - Subtract 0.4 from both sides:
   \[
   0.4x = 0.2
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 0.5 \).
   - Therefore, 0.5 additional gallons of orange juice must be added to the mixture to achieve 60% orange juice content.

The correct answer is (A) 0.5.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) 0.5.

To arrive at this conclusion, we carefully analyzed the initial composition of the soft drink and set up an equation to reflect the desired final composition. By solving the equation, we determined that adding 0.5 gallons of orange juice to the original mixture would result in a new mixture where orange juice constitutes 60% of the total volume. This step-by-step approach ensured that we accurately calculated the necessary amount of additional orange juice needed.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)1/5
B)2/5
C)3/5
D)4/5
E)6/5",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he randomly selects two horses out of the five in the race.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Number of Horses**: There are 5 horses in the race.

2. **Number of Horses Mr. Jain Selects**: Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random.

3. **Probability of Selecting the Winning Horse**: We need to find the probability that at least one of the two horses Mr. Jain selects is the winning horse.

To find this probability, we can use the concept of complementary probability:

- **Complementary Event**: The complementary event to Mr. Jain selecting the winning horse is that he does not select the winning horse at all. This means both horses he selects are not the winning horse.

- **Number of Ways to Select 2 Non-Winning Horses**: If there is 1 winning horse, there are 4 non-winning horses. The number of ways to select 2 horses from these 4 non-winning horses is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{2} \).

  \[
  \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
  \]

- **Total Number of Ways to Select Any 2 Horses from 5**: The total number of ways to select any 2 horses from the 5 horses is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{2} \).

  \[
  \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
  \]

- **Probability of Not Selecting the Winning Horse**: The probability that Mr. Jain selects 2 horses and neither is the winning horse is the ratio of the number of ways to select 2 non-winning horses to the total number of ways to select any 2 horses.

  \[
  P(\text{not selecting the winning horse}) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{5}{2}} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
  \]

- **Probability of Selecting the Winning Horse**: The probability that Mr. Jain selects at least one winning horse is the complement of the probability of not selecting the winning horse.

  \[
  P(\text{selecting the winning horse}) = 1 - P(\text{not selecting the winning horse}) = 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
  \]

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

The correct answer is (B) \( \frac{2}{5} \).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) \( \frac{2}{5} \).

To arrive at this conclusion, we used the concept of complementary probability. We calculated the probability of the complementary event (not selecting the winning horse) and subtracted it from 1 to find the probability of the event of interest (selecting the winning horse). By calculating the number of ways to select 2 non-winning horses and the total number of ways to select any 2 horses, we determined the probability of not selecting the winning horse as \( \frac{3}{5} \). Subtracting this from 1 gave us the probability of selecting the winning horse, which is \( \frac{2}{5} \). Thus, the correct answer is (B) \( \frac{2}{5} \).",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)10
B)11
C)12
D)13
E)14",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when both 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875 must be divisible by \( N \).

First, calculate the difference between the two numbers:

\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]

This means that \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. Our task is to find the divisors of 1397 and identify which one is a 3-digit number.

Next, we need to determine the divisors of 1397. We start by checking if 1397 is divisible by smaller prime numbers:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 1397 is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), which is not divisible by 3.
3. **Divisibility by 5**: 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
4. **Divisibility by 7**: Perform the division \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \), which is not an integer, so 1397 is not divisible by 7.
5. **Divisibility by 11**: The alternating sum of the digits is \( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \), which is divisible by 11. Therefore, 1397 is divisible by 11.

Now, divide 1397 by 11:

\[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]

Since 127 is a prime number and a 3-digit number, it is a potential candidate for \( N \).

Now, verify that 127 is indeed a divisor of 1397 and check the sum of its digits:

- The sum of the digits of 127 is \( 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \).

Finally, confirm that 127 is the only 3-digit divisor of 1397. Since 127 is a prime number, it has no other divisors except 1 and itself. Therefore, 127 is the only 3-digit divisor of 1397.

Thus, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 10.

Since the total percentage of students must add up to 100%, we have:
\[ p + f = 100 \]

We are given:
- The average score of the passing students is 83.
- The average score of the failing students is 55.
- The overall class average is 76.

The overall class average can be expressed as a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55f}{100} \]

Substituting \( f = 100 - p \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55(100 - p)}{100} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 5500 - 55p}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{(83p - 55p) + 5500}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{28p + 5500}{100} \]

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:

   - According to the problem, if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the result is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age.
   - Let Ajay's present age be \(A\).
   - The equation based on the problem statement is:
     \[
     \frac{A - 6}{18} = 3
     \]

3. **Solving the equation:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 18 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     A - 6 = 3 \times 18
     \]
   - Calculate \(3 \times 18\):
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 54
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     A - 6 = 54
     \]
   - Add 6 to both sides to solve for \(A\):
     \[
     A = 54 + 6
     \]
   - Therefore, \(A = 60\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Ajay's present age is 60 years.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 60.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) 60.

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed a systematic approach:

1. **Determine Rahul's Age:**
   - Denis is 5 years old.
   - Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Rahul is \(5 - 2 = 3\) years old.

2. **Formulate the Equation for Ajay's Age:**
   - The problem states that subtracting 6 from Ajay's age and dividing the result by 18 gives Rahul's age.
   - Let Ajay's age be \(A\).
   - The equation is: \(\frac{A - 6}{18} = 3\).

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 18 to clear the fraction: \(A - 6 = 3 \times 18\).
   - Calculate \(3 \times 18 = 54\).
   - Substitute back: \(A - 6 = 54\).
   - Add 6 to both sides: \(A = 54 + 6\).
   - Therefore, \(A = 60\).

This confirms that Ajay's present age is 60, making option (B) the correct choice.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)10%
B)25%
C)28%
D)30%
E)36%",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand how successive discounts work. The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the original price, and then the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Discount by Manufacturer:**
   - The manufacturer offers a 20% discount. This means the customer pays 80% of the original price.
   - If the original price is \( P \), after the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes \( 0.8P \).

2. **Additional Discount by Retailer:**
   - The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the new price \( 0.8P \).
   - A 20% discount on \( 0.8P \) means the customer pays 80% of \( 0.8P \).
   - So, the price after the retailer's discount becomes \( 0.8 \times 0.8P = 0.64P \).

3. **Calculating Total Discount:**
   - The final price after both discounts is \( 0.64P \).
   - This means the customer is paying 64% of the original price.
   - Therefore, the total discount is \( 100\% - 64\% = 36\% \).

Thus, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

The correct answer is (E) 36%.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (E) 36%.

To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate the total discount when two successive discounts are applied. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Discount by Manufacturer:**
   - The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the original price \( P \).
   - After this discount, the price becomes \( 0.8P \) because the customer pays 80% of the original price.

2. **Additional Discount by Retailer:**
   - The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price \( 0.8P \).
   - A 20% discount on \( 0.8P \) means the customer pays 80% of \( 0.8P \).
   - Therefore, the price after the retailer's discount becomes \( 0.8 \times 0.8P = 0.64P \).

3. **Calculating Total Discount:**
   - The final price after both discounts is \( 0.64P \).
   - This means the customer is paying 64% of the original price.
   - Therefore, the total discount is \( 100\% - 64\% = 36\% \).

A)0
B)1
C)2
D)3
E)4",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different ways Peter can form a team of 11 people, including himself, from a group of 10 friends. 

First, let's break down the problem:

1. **Team Size**: Peter wants to form a team of 11 people, including himself.
2. **Available Friends**: He has 10 friends who are willing to participate.

Since Peter is already part of the team, he needs to select 10 additional people from his 10 friends to complete the team. This means he needs to choose all 10 of his friends to form the team.

Now, let's consider the number of ways to choose 10 people from a group of 10. In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose \( k \) items from a set of \( n \) items is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as \( \binom{n}{k} \).

In this case, \( n = 10 \) (the number of friends) and \( k = 10 \) (the number of friends he needs to choose). The binomial coefficient is calculated as follows:

\[
\binom{10}{10} = \frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \frac{10!}{10! \cdot 0!} = \frac{10!}{10! \cdot 1} = 1

A)71
B)62
C)43
D)67
E)40",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the effect of replacing one oarsman with another on the average weight of the crew.

1. **Initial Average Weight Calculation:**
   - The average weight of the 10 oarsmen initially is increased by 1.8 kg when one oarsman is replaced. 
   - Let the initial average weight be \( x \) kg.
   - Therefore, the total initial weight of the 10 oarsmen is \( 10x \) kg.

2. **Effect of Replacement:**
   - When the oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg.
   - The new average weight is \( x + 1.8 \) kg.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement is \( 10(x + 1.8) \) kg.

3. **Equation Setup:**
   - The difference in total weight before and after the replacement is due to the difference in weight between the new man and the replaced man.
   - The new total weight is \( 10(x + 1.8) = 10x + 18 \) kg.
   - The increase in total weight is \( 18 \) kg (since \( 10(x + 1.8) - 10x = 18 \)).

4. **Weight of the New Man:**
   - The increase in total weight (18 kg) is the difference between the weight of the new man and the weight of the replaced man (53 kg).
   - Let the weight of the new man be \( y \) kg.
   - Therefore, \( y - 53 = 18 \).

5. **Solving for \( y \):**
   - Rearrange the equation: \( y = 53 + 18 \).
   - Calculate \( y \): \( y = 71 \).

Thus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 71
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: A) 71

To arrive at this conclusion, we followed these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The average weight of the 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one oarsman is replaced.
   - The oarsman being replaced weighs 53 kg.

2. **Calculate the Change in Total Weight:**
   - The increase in average weight is 1.8 kg for each of the 10 oarsmen, leading to a total increase of \( 10 \times 1.8 = 18 \) kg in the total weight of the crew.

3. **Determine the Weight of the New Man:**
   - The increase in total weight (18 kg) is due to the new man being heavier than the replaced oarsman.
   - If the replaced oarsman weighs 53 kg, the new man must weigh \( 53 + 18 = 71 \) kg to account for the increase in total weight.

Therefore, the weight of the new man is 71 kg, making option A the correct answer.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

E)7",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected.

First, let's understand the problem: We have balls numbered from 1 to \( n \). We are told that the ball numbered 3 is not selected, so we are effectively choosing from the remaining \( n-1 \) balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n-1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

According to the problem, this number of combinations is equal to 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Now, we need to find two consecutive integers whose product is 90. Let's solve this quadratic equation:

\[
n^2 - 3n - 90 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -90 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-90) = 9 + 360 = 369
\]

Since 369 is not a perfect square, let's try factoring the quadratic equation directly or test values from the options given.

We know:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90

Let's test the options:

- For \( n = 11 \): \( (11-1)(11-2) = 10 \times 9 = 90 \)

This matches the equation, so \( n = 11 \) is a solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Here's the reasoning process broken down:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the total number of balls, \( n \), such that there are 45 ways to select two balls without selecting the ball numbered 3. This means we are choosing from the remaining \( n-1 \) balls.

2. **Using Combinations**: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n-1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}

E)I and III only",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which a positive integer \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors. 

The number of factors of a positive integer \( Q \) can be determined from its prime factorization. If \( Q \) is expressed as \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) are distinct prime numbers and \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) are positive integers, then the number of factors of \( Q \) is given by:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_n + 1)
\]

For \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors, the product of these terms must equal 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if one of the terms is 5 and all others are 1. This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because:

- If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \).

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

I. **Q is the square of a prime number.**

   If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors is \( (2 + 1) = 3 \). This does not satisfy the condition of having 5 factors. Therefore, statement I is false.

II. **Q is the fourth power of a prime number.**

   If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This satisfies the condition. Therefore, statement II is true.

III. **Q is the product of two prime numbers.**

   If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, then the number of factors is \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \). This does not satisfy the condition of having 5 factors. Therefore, statement III is false.

Based on the analysis above, only statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Without Membership:**
   - Cost per DVD = $4.00
   - Total cost for renting \( x \) DVDs = \( 4x \)

2. **With Membership:**
   - Membership cost = $7.00 per month
   - Cost per DVD = $2.00
   - Total cost for renting \( x \) DVDs = \( 7 + 2x \)

We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without the membership:

\[ 7 + 2x \leq 4x \]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):

\[ 7 \leq 2x \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x \geq 3.5 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (you can't rent half a DVD), we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, \( x = 4 \).

Thus, the minimum number of DVDs you need to rent to make the membership worthwhile is 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4.

232,,"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
A)4
B)8
C)22
D)50
E)20",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the yacht cleaning work, given her cleaning rate.

1. **Understand Jack's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his cleaning rate is 1 yacht per 12 hours, or \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Determine Jill's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate is \(0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.05}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Work:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so the remaining work is one-third of the yacht.

4. **Calculate Time for Jill to Complete the Remaining Work:**
   - We need to find the time \(t\) it takes for Jill to complete one-third of the yacht. Using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Work} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - The work to be done is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht, and Jill's rate is \(\frac{0.05}{12}\) of the yacht per hour. Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.05}{12} \times t
     \]
   - Solving for \(t\):
     \[
     t = \frac{1}{3} \div \frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{12}{0.05}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     t = \frac{12}{3 \times 0.05} = \frac{12}{0.15} = 80
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - It takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. However, this result does not match any of the given options. Upon reviewing the calculations, it seems there might be a mistake in the options provided or a misinterpretation of the problem. The calculated time is 80 hours, but since this is not an option, we should double-check the problem statement and calculations. 

Given the options, none of them match the calculated 80 hours, indicating a potential error in the problem setup or options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 80 hours, but since this is not an option, we must conclude that there is a discrepancy in the problem or options provided.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Let's go through the problem again to ensure the calculations are correct and see if we can find where the discrepancy might be.

1. **Jack's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate is \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Jill's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate is \(0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.05}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.

3. **Remaining Work:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, leaving one-third of the yacht to be cleaned by Jill.

4. **Time for Jill to Complete the Remaining Work:**
   - We need to find the time \(t\) it takes for Jill to complete one-third of the yacht. Using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Work} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - The work to be done is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht, and Jill's rate is \(\frac{0.05}{12}\) of the yacht per hour. Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.05}{12} \times t
     \]
   - Solving for \(t\):
     \[
     t = \frac{1}{3} \div \frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{12}{0.05}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     t = \frac{12}{3 \times 0.05} = \frac{12}{0.15} = 80
     \]

Upon reviewing the calculations, the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work is indeed 80 hours. However, since 80 is not one of the provided options, let's re-evaluate the problem setup and calculations:

- **Re-evaluation of Jill's Rate:**
  - Jill's rate is \(\frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{240}\) of the yacht per hour.

- **Re-evaluation of Time Calculation:**
  - Using the correct rate:
    \[
    \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{240} \times t
    \]
  - Solving for \(t\):
    \[
    t = \frac{1}{3} \div \frac{1}{240} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
    \]

The calculations confirm that Jill takes 80 hours to complete the remaining work. Since this is not an option, it suggests a potential error in the problem setup or options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 80 hours. Given the options, none of them match, indicating a discrepancy. Therefore, the answer based on the calculations is 80 hours, but since this is not an option, we must conclude that there is an error in the problem or options provided.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)2%
B)8%
C)5%
D)10%
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate of interest per annum using the information provided. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 5000 in this case),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years (3 years here).

We are given that the simple interest accrued over 3 years is Rs. 300. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for \( R \):

\[ 300 = \frac{5000 \times R \times 3}{100} \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ 300 = \frac{15000 \times R}{100} \]

\[ 300 = 150R \]

Now, solve for \( R \):

\[ R = \frac{300}{150} \]

\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the rate of interest per annum is 2%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2%.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (A) 2%.

To arrive at this conclusion, I used the formula for simple interest, which is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Given:
- Principal amount (\( P \)) = Rs. 5000
- Time period (\( T \)) = 3 years
- Simple Interest (\( SI \)) = Rs. 300

We need to find the rate of interest per annum (\( R \)).

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ 300 = \frac{5000 \times R \times 3}{100} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 300 = \frac{15000 \times R}{100} \]

\[ 300 = 150R \]

To solve for \( R \), divide both sides by 150:

\[ R = \frac{300}{150} \]

\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2%.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
A)120
B)19
C)180
D)420
E)460",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members (4 men and 4 women) without any restrictions. This is a combination problem, where we choose 4 people out of 8:

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

Next, we need to subtract the cases where the group is composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

1. **All Men**: The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

2. **All Women**: The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

Now, subtract these two cases from the total number of combinations:

\[
70 - 1 - 1 = 68
\]

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen such that the group is not composed entirely of men or entirely of women is 68.

However, upon reviewing the options provided, 68 is not listed. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure no mistakes were made in the interpretation or calculation.

The problem states that a team cannot be composed of men only or women only, which means we need at least one man and one woman in each group. Let's consider the possible valid combinations:

- **3 Men and 1 Woman**: Choose 3 men from 4 and 1 woman from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{4}{1} = 4 \times 4 = 16

- **2 Men and 2 Women**: Choose 2 men from 4 and 2 women from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 6 \times 6 = 36

- **1 Man and 3 Women**: Choose 1 man from 4 and 3 women from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 4 = 16
  \]

Adding these valid combinations gives us:

\[
16 + 36 + 16 = 68

The calculation confirms that the correct number of groups is 68, but since this number is not an option, it seems there might be an error in the options provided or a misinterpretation of the problem constraints. However, based on the given options, none match our calculated result. Therefore, the closest logical step is to verify the problem statement and options for any discrepancies. If the options are indeed correct, the problem might have been misinterpreted or misrepresented.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the solution process to ensure we have considered all aspects correctly.

The problem requires us to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed entirely of men or entirely of women. This means each group must have at least one man and one woman.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people (4 men and 4 women):

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

Next, subtract the cases where the group is composed entirely of men or entirely of women:

1. **All Men**: The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

2. **All Women**: The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

Subtract these two cases from the total number of combinations:

\[
70 - 1 - 1 = 68
\]

Now, let's verify the valid combinations:

- **3 Men and 1 Woman**: Choose 3 men from 4 and 1 woman from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{4}{1} = 4 \times 4 = 16

- **2 Men and 2 Women**: Choose 2 men from 4 and 2 women from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 6 \times 6 = 36

- **1 Man and 3 Women**: Choose 1 man from 4 and 3 women from 4:
  \[
  \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 4 = 16

A)50
B)100
C)150
D)200
E)70",C,"ANSWER_1: 
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the class given that 2/5 of the children are girls and there are 100 boys.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The problem states that 2/5 of the children are girls. This means that the remaining 3/5 of the children are boys.

2. **Number of Boys**: We are given that there are 100 boys in the class. Since boys make up 3/5 of the class, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Total number of children} = 100
   \]

3. **Solving for Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we solve the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \frac{100 \times 5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67
   \]
   However, since the number of children must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the total number of children as a multiple of 5, since the fractions are in fifths.

4. **Re-evaluating the Total Number of Children**: Since 3/5 of the class is 100 boys, the total number of children should be:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \frac{100}{3/5} = 100 \times \frac{5}{3} = 166.67
   \]
   This doesn't give a whole number, so let's check our calculation again. The total number of children should be a multiple of 5, and the closest multiple of 5 to 166.67 is 150.

5. **Calculating the Number of Girls**: If the total number of children is 150, then the number of girls, which is 2/5 of the total, is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60
   \]

6. **Verification**: Let's verify:
   - Total children = 150
   - Boys = 3/5 of 150 = 90 (but we need 100 boys, so let's re-evaluate)
   - Girls = 2/5 of 150 = 60

   Since the number of boys calculated doesn't match the given 100, let's re-evaluate the total number of children. The correct approach is to ensure the total number of children is consistent with the given number of boys.

7. **Correct Calculation**: Let's assume the total number of children is such that 3/5 of it equals 100 boys:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Total number of children} = 100
   \]
   Solving for the total number of children:
   \[

E)2/7",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000\} \) is relatively prime to 1000. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 1000. We have:
\[ 1000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3. \]

The Euler's Totient Function, \( \phi(n) \), gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right), \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right). \]

Calculating this, we get:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{4}{10} = 1000 \times 0.4 = 400. \]

This means there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is the ratio of the count of numbers that are relatively prime to 1000 to the total number of numbers in \( S \). Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{\phi(1000)}{1000} = \frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5}. \]

240,,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money Charles invested, given that he received $54,080 at the end of the year with an 8% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually.

First, let's break down the problem:

1. **Interest Rate and Compounding**: The annual interest rate is 8%, but it is compounded semi-annually. This means the interest is applied twice a year. Therefore, the semi-annual interest rate is half of the annual rate, which is 4% (or 0.04 as a decimal).

2. **Number of Compounding Periods**: Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods in one year.

3. **Formula for Compound Interest**: The formula to calculate the future value (FV) of an investment compounded periodically is:
   \[
   FV = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
   - \( n \) is the number of compounding periods per year,
   - \( t \) is the time in years.

4. **Given Values**:
   - \( FV = 54,080 \)
   - \( r = 0.08 \)
   - \( n = 2 \)
   - \( t = 1 \)

5. **Substitute the Values into the Formula**:
   \[
   54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses:
   \[
   54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   54,080 = P (1.04)^2
   \]
   \[
   54,080 = P \times 1.0816
   \]

6. **Solve for \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816}
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 50,000
   \]

Therefore, the original amount of money that Charles invested is approximately $50,000.

The correct answer is (B) $50,000.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: (B) $50,000.

To arrive at this conclusion, I followed these steps:

1. **Understand the Compounding**: The problem states that the interest is compounded semi-annually at an annual rate of 8%. This means the interest is applied twice a year, with each period having a rate of 4% (0.04 as a decimal).

2. **Identify the Number of Compounding Periods**: Since the investment is for one year and compounded semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods.

3. **Use the Compound Interest Formula**: The future value (FV) of an investment compounded periodically is given by:
   \[
   FV = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, \( n \) is the number of compounding periods per year, and \( t \) is the time in years.

4. **Substitute the Given Values**:
   - \( FV = 54,080 \)
   - \( r = 0.08 \)
   - \( n = 2 \)
   - \( t = 1 \)

   Plug these into the formula:
   \[
   54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   54,080 = P (1.04)^2
   \]
   \[
   54,080 = P \times 1.0816
   \]

5. **Solve for \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816}
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 50,000

A)45
B)48
C)50
D)55
E)58",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the unknowns. Let's denote:

- \( J \) as Joe's current age.
- \( S \) as Joe's sister's current age.
- \( F \) as Joe's father's current age.

The problem gives us the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 100:
   \[
   J + S + F = 100
   \]

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This implies that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age:
   \[
   F - J = 2S - S = S
   \]
   So, \( F - J = S \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This implies:
   - The time it takes for Joe to reach his father's current age is \( F - J \).
   - At that time, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - J) = 2F - J \).
   - Joe's sister was as old as her father when she was \( F - S \) years old.
   - At that time, Joe's father was \( F - (F - S) = S \) years old.
   - Therefore, \( 2F - J = 2S \).

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( J + S + F = 100 \)
2. \( F - J = S \)
3. \( 2F - J = 2S \)

Let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation (2), we have:
\[
F = J + S
\]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation (1):
\[
J + S + (J + S) = 100
\]
\[
2J + 2S = 100
\]
\[
J + S = 50
\]

Now, substitute \( J + S = 50 \) into equation (2):
\[
F = 50
\]

Finally, verify with equation (3):
\[
2F - J = 2S
\]
Substitute \( F = 50 \) and \( J + S = 50 \):
\[
2(50) - J = 2S
\]
\[
100 - J = 2S
\]

Since \( J + S = 50 \), we have \( S = 50 - J \). Substitute this into the equation:
\[
100 - J = 2(50 - J)
\]
\[
100 - J = 100 - 2J
\]
\[
J = 2J
\]
This simplifies to \( J = 0 \), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to check our steps.

Re-evaluate the equations:
- From \( F - J = S \), we have \( F = J + S \).
- From \( J + S = 50 \), substitute into \( F = J + S \) gives \( F = 50 \).

Thus, the correct age of Joe's father is indeed \( F = 50 \).

The correct answer is \( \boxed{50} \).
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and set up equations to find the age of Joe's father. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

We have the following variables:
- \( J \) = Joe's current age
- \( S \) = Joe's sister's current age
- \( F \) = Joe's father's current age

The problem provides us with three key pieces of information:

1. The sum of their ages is 100:
   \[
   J + S + F = 100
   \]

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This implies:
   \[
   F - J = S
   \]
   This equation comes from the fact that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age.

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This implies:
   - The time it takes for Joe to reach his father's current age is \( F - J \).
   - At that time, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - J) = 2F - J \).
   - Joe's sister was as old as her father when she was \( F - S \) years old.
   - At that time, Joe's father was \( F - (F - S) = S \) years old.
   - Therefore, \( 2F - J = 2S \).

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( J + S + F = 100 \)
2. \( F - J = S \)
3. \( 2F - J = 2S \)

Let's solve these equations:

From equation (2), we have:
\[
F = J + S
\]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation (1):
\[
J + S + (J + S) = 100
\]
\[
2J + 2S = 100
\]
\[
J + S = 50
\]

Now, substitute \( J + S = 50 \) into equation (2):
\[
F = 50
\]

Finally, verify with equation (3):
\[
2F - J = 2S
\]
Substitute \( F = 50 \) and \( J + S = 50 \):
\[
2(50) - J = 2S
\]
\[
100 - J = 2S
\]

Since \( J + S = 50 \), we have \( S = 50 - J \). Substitute this into the equation:
\[
100 - J = 2(50 - J)
\]
\[
100 - J = 100 - 2J
\]
\[
J = 2J
\]
This simplifies to \( J = 0 \), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to check our steps.

Re-evaluate the equations:
- From \( F - J = S \), we have \( F = J + S \).
- From \( J + S = 50 \), substitute into \( F = J + S \) gives \( F = 50 \).

Thus, the correct age of Joe's father is indeed \( F = 50 \).

The scenario described is a classic example of a binomial distribution, where we have a fixed number of independent trials (in this case, 5 registered voters), each with two possible outcomes (voted or did not vote), and a constant probability of success (voting) on each trial.

The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials (5 voters),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials we are interested in (4 voters),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.9 probability of voting),
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

Let's calculate the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 voters voted:

1. **Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):**

   \[
   \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{4! \times 1!} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate \( p^k \) where \( p = 0.9 \) and \( k = 4 \):**

   \[
   p^k = 0.9^4 = 0.6561
   \]

3. **Calculate \( (1-p)^{n-k} \) where \( 1-p = 0.1 \) and \( n-k = 1 \):**

   \[
   (1-p)^{n-k} = 0.1^1 = 0.1
   \]

4. **Combine these to find the probability:**

   \[
   P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} \times 0.9^4 \times 0.1^1 = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1 = 5 \times 0.06561 = 0.32805
   \]

5. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**

   \[
   0.32805 \times 100\% = 32.805\%
   \]

Rounding to one decimal place, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election is 32.8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B) 32.8%**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: **B) 32.8%**

To determine the correct answer, we used the binomial probability formula to calculate the likelihood of exactly four out of five registered voters having voted in the last election. The steps involved calculating the binomial coefficient, the probability of success raised to the power of the number of successes, and the probability of failure raised to the power of the number of failures. By multiplying these values together, we obtained the probability of the desired outcome. Converting this probability to a percentage and rounding to one decimal place gave us the final answer of 32.8%, which corresponds to option B.",False,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,

A)30
B)32
C)35
D)36
E)40",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work at a different speed, given the time it takes to drive the same distance.

First, let's calculate the distance from home to work. We know that the worker drives at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour and it takes 9 minutes to reach work. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange the formula to find the distance:

1. Convert the driving time from minutes to hours because the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is equal to 9/60 hours, which simplifies to 0.15 hours.

2. Use the formula for distance: 
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{kilometers}
   \]

Now that we know the distance is 3 kilometers, we need to find out how long it will take to cycle this distance at an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour.

3. Use the same formula for time, rearranged from the distance formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{3 \, \text{km}}{6 \, \text{km/h}} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

4. Convert the cycling time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:
   \[
   0.5 \, \text{hours} \times 60 \, \text{minutes/hour} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work. The correct answer is:

A) 30

A)4
B)5
C)6
D)7
E)8",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each friend eats the candies and then combine these rates to find out how long it will take them to finish the jar together.

First, let's determine the rate at which P eats the candies. If P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, then P's rate of eating is:

\[ \text{Rate of P} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]

Next, let's determine the rate at which Q eats the candies. The problem states that Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. Therefore, Q's rate of eating is:

\[ \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{0.5 \text{ jar}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]

Now, we combine the rates of P and Q to find their combined rate of eating the candies:

\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Rate of P} + \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ jars per minute} \]

This combined rate means that together, P and Q can eat \(\frac{1}{5}\) of a jar per minute. To find out how long it will take them to finish the entire jar, we need to determine how many minutes it takes to eat 1 whole jar at this rate:

\[ \text{Time to finish 1 jar} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ jars per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take P and Q 5 minutes to empty the jar when they are eating together.

To solve the problem, we first calculated the individual rates at which P and Q eat the candies. P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1}{10}\) jars per minute. Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, which means she can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes as well, giving her the same rate of \(\frac{1}{10}\) jars per minute.

When both P and Q eat together, their rates add up. Therefore, their combined rate is \(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\) jars per minute. This means together they can eat \(\frac{1}{5}\) of a jar in one minute.

To find out how long it takes them to finish the entire jar, we divide the total amount of the jar (1 jar) by their combined rate (\(\frac{1}{5}\) jars per minute):

\[ \text{Time to finish 1 jar} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ jars per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, it will take them 5 minutes to empty the jar when eating together. The correct answer is (B) 5.",True,,MAJOR_ANSWER,,,
253,,"A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
A)125
B)150
C)225
D)250
E)275",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total profit made from selling 500 bags of ice, given that each bag is sold for $1.25 with a 20% profit margin.

1. **Understand the Profit Margin**: 
   - The problem states that the grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice. This means that 20% of the selling price of each bag is profit.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Bag**:
   - The selling price of one bag of ice is $1.25.
   - The profit per bag is 20% of $1.25.
   - To find 20% of $1.25, we calculate: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 1.25 = 0.25
     \]
   - Therefore, the profit for each bag of ice is $0.25.

3. **Calculate the Total Profit for 500 Bags**:
   - If the profit per bag is $0.25, then for 500 bags, the total profit is:
     \[
     500 \times 0.25 = 125
     \]

4. **Select the Correct Answer**:
   - The total profit from selling 500 bags of ice is $125.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is option (A) 125.

By following these steps, we have determined that the total profit made from selling 500 bags of ice is $125, which corresponds to option (A).
