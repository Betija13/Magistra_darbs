A car is moving towards a tower, and the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - The car is moving in a straight line towards the tower.
   - The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find the time it takes to reach the base of the tower after the angle is 60°.

2. **Using trigonometry:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the tower when the angle is 45° be \( d_1 \).
   - Let the distance from the tower when the angle is 60° be \( d_2 \).

3. **Using the tangent function:**
   - At 45°, \( \tan(45°) = 1 \), so \( \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \) which implies \( d_1 = h \).
   - At 60°, \( \tan(60°) = \sqrt{3} \), so \( \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

4. **Finding the distance traveled in 10 minutes:**
   - The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - Distance traveled in 10 minutes = \( d_1 - d_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \).

5. **Finding the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance to the base = \( d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

6. **Finding the time to reach the base:**
   - The speed of the car is constant, so the time taken to travel the remaining distance is proportional to the distance.
   - Time to reach the base = \( \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Distance traveled in 10 minutes}} \times 10 \).
   - Time = \( \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})} \times 10 \).

7. **Simplifying the expression:**
   - Time = \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})} \times 10 \).
   - Simplify \( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}} \).
   - Time = \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times 10 \).
   - Time = \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \).

8. **Rationalizing the denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{3} + 1 \).
   - Time = \( \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \).
   - Time = \( \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} \).
   - Time = \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

Therefore, the car will take 5(√3 + 1) more minutes to reach the base of the tower.

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve the problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Let the original price of the item be \( x \).

2. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( x - 0.22x = 0.78x \).

3. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is \( 0.78x - 20 \).

4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the amount paid is \( \frac{x}{2} + 1.90 \).

5. Set up the equation based on the information given:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

6. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x) - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]

   Simplify:
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]

   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]

   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8
   \]

   Divide by 0.56:
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} = 78.2142857
   \]

   Round to the nearest cent:
   \[
   x = 78.20
   \]

The original price of the item is $78.20.

Therefore, the correct choice is:

To solve this problem, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, given the average of the highest and lowest scores (x), the average score for the entire class (y), and the number of students (z).

1. **Understanding the given information:**
   - The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x, so:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
     \]
   - The average score for the entire class is y, so the total score for all students is:
     \[
     zy
     \]

2. **Finding the total score excluding the highest and lowest scores:**
   - The total score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scores is:
     \[
     \text{Total score excluding } H \text{ and } L = zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x
     \]

3. **Calculating the average score excluding the highest and lowest scores:**
   - The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is \(z - 2\).
   - Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:
     \[
     \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}
     \]

4. **Matching with the given options:**
   - The expression \(\frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}\) matches option (D).

The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions 3, 4, and 15:
\[ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 225} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{25 \times 10} \]
\[ d = 5\sqrt{10} \]

Now, we approximate \( \sqrt{10} \):
\[ \sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623 \]

Thus, the diagonal (and therefore the diameter of the sphere) is:
\[ d = 5 \times 3.1623 \]

(B)
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population of the city after 2 years, given that it increases by 5% annually.

1. Start with the current population: 78,000.
2. Calculate the population after 1 year by increasing it by 5%:
   - 5% of 78,000 is 0.05 * 78,000 = 3,900.
   - Add this to the current population: 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900.
3. Calculate the population after the second year by increasing the new population by 5%:
   - 5% of 81,900 is 0.05 * 81,900 = 4,095.
   - Add this to the population after the first year: 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995.

Now, compare this result with the given choices:

A) 81,900
B) 85,995
C) 85,800
D) 90,000
E) None of these

To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's total monthly income based on his spending and savings rate.

1. **Identify the savings rate**: The man saves 12.5% of his income. This means he spends 87.5% of his income.

2. **Set up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the man's monthly income. According to the problem, he spends Rs. 3500, which is 87.5% of his income.

   \[
   0.875x = 3500
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:

   \[
   x = \frac{3500}{0.875}
   \]

   \[
   x = 4000

The man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

1. **Calculate the number of toys in one box:**
   - One dozen equals 12, so five dozen toys are 5 * 12 = 60 toys per box.

2. **Calculate the number of toys in one tempo:**
   - There are 98 boxes in one tempo, so the total number of toys in one tempo is 98 * 60 = 5880 toys.

3. **Determine how many tempos are needed for 29400 toys:**
   - Divide the total number of toys (29400) by the number of toys per tempo (5880):
     29400 / 5880 = 5

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys.

A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"B)11
------
To solve this problem, I previously tackled a similar problem involving the transformation of a wire from one geometric shape to another while maintaining the same perimeter. The methodology involves calculating the perimeter of the original shape and then using that perimeter to determine the side length of the new shape.

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \).
   - For this rectangle, \( P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \) cm.

2. Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm.

3. Calculate the side length of the square:
   - The formula for the perimeter of a square is \( P = 4 \times \text{side} \).
   - Set the perimeter of the square equal to 88 cm: \( 4 \times \text{side} = 88 \).
   - Solve for the side: \( \text{side} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \) cm.

The measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

The result is (C).
------
B)11
------
To solve the problem, we need to find the perimeter of the original rectangle and then use that to find the side length of the square.

Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \).
- Here, the length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm.
- So, \( P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \) cm.

Step 2: Use the perimeter to find the side length of the square.
- The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm.
- The formula for the perimeter of a square is \( P = 4 \times \text{side} \).
- So, \( 4 \times \text{side} = 88 \).
- Solving for the side, we get \( \text{side} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \) cm.

The measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"Let's break down the problem:

1. Let the amount each nephew receives be Rs x.
2. Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives Rs 4x.
3. Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew, so each son receives Rs 5x.

Now, calculate the total amount distributed:

- Total amount for 2 nephews = 2 * x = 2x
- Total amount for 4 daughters = 4 * 4x = 16x
- Total amount for 5 sons = 5 * 5x = 25x

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:

2x + 16x + 25x = 8600

Combine like terms:

43x = 8600

Solve for x:

x = 8600 / 43
x = 200

Now, find the amount each daughter receives:

Each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

The answer is (E) Rs 800.

98,,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"To solve the problem, let's denote Meenu's weight as \( x \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

This can be translated into the equation:
\[ x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2x = 58 + x \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ 2x - x = 58 \]
\[ x = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The correct answer is (D) 58.
