0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the following:

- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know:

1. When the angle of elevation is 45°, the tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite side (height of the tower) over the adjacent side (distance from the base of the tower). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
   \]

2. When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

The car takes 10 minutes to travel from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \). The distance traveled in this time is:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[
v = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{10} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 \)).

The time \( t \) is given by:
\[
t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]

\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3})
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This implies considering the worst-case scenario where the events are not independent and the probability of neither event occurring is maximized.

The greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - P(\text{A increases}) - P(\text{B increases}) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs, considering the constraints of the problem, is when the events are independent, which we calculated as 0.1144.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \frac{\text{Profit Percentage}}{100}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 360 = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \frac{20}{100}) \]

\[ 360 = \text{Cost Price} \times 1.2 \]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.2:

A)40

Initially, all marbles in the bag are white. We pull out 20 marbles, paint them black, and put them back in the bag. So, there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

Next, we pull out another 20 marbles, and 1 of them is black. This means that the proportion of black marbles in the bag is the same as the proportion of black marbles in this sample. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = 0.05 = 5\%
\]

This implies that 5% of the total marbles in the bag are black. Since we know there are 20 black marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.05 \times Q = 20

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.

First, let's calculate the minimum number of students who attended each event:

- At least 45% attended the prom night:  
  \( 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \) students

- At least 35% took part in the debating session:  
  \( 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \) students

Now, we want to find the maximum number of students who did neither. To do this, we should consider the minimum overlap between the two groups, which occurs when the number of students who attended both events is minimized.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who attended at least one of the events is given by:

\[ 
\text{Number of students in at least one event} = (\text{Students at prom}) + (\text{Students in debate}) - (\text{Students in both})
\]

To maximize the number of students who did neither, we minimize the overlap (students in both events). The minimum overlap occurs when the total number of students in at least one event is maximized, which is when the overlap is zero.

Thus, the maximum number of students who attended at least one event is:

\[ 
90 + 70 = 160

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:

\[ 
200 - 160 = 40

However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate:

If we assume the minimum overlap (students in both events) is zero, then:

- Students in at least one event = 90 + 70 - 0 = 160
- Students in neither event = 200 - 160 = 40

This doesn't match any of the choices. Let's consider the possibility of overlap:

If we assume the maximum overlap, then:

- Students in both events = 70 (since 70 is the smaller group, all of them could be in both)
- Students in at least one event = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
- Students in neither event = 200 - 90 = 110

This matches choice E.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. Walking 20 steps and stopping, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. Walking 10 steps and stopping, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

For the first scenario:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes, so the elevator's speed equation is:

D)32
E)None of the above",D,"To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold this year (first 10 months) = 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

3. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22-month period:**
   - Total sold over 22 months = Total sold last year + Total sold this year
   - Total sold over 22 months = 504 ovens + 200 ovens = 704 ovens.

4. **Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Average = Total sold over 22 months / 22 months
   - Average = 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32.

Let's break down the information given:

1. The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students:

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's calculate the profit made on each bag:

1. The selling price of each bag is $100.
2. The profit percentage is 25% of the selling price.
3. Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:
   \[
   \text{Profit per bag} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25

Now, we know the total profit made is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding the equation:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

1. For math: \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math, so \( N \) must be divisible by 16.
2. For bio: \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, so \( N \) must be divisible by 10.
3. For English: \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English, so \( N \) must be divisible by 8.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 will give us the smallest number that \( N \) must be divisible by. 

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:

- For 2, the highest power is \( 2^4 \).
- For 5, the highest power is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Now, we need to find the range of 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. The smallest multiple of 80 that is greater than or equal to 1000 is:

\[ \lceil \frac{1000}{80} \rceil = \lceil 12.5 \rceil = 13 \]

So, the smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

The largest 4-digit number is 9999. The largest multiple of 80 that is less than or equal to 9999 is:

\[ \lfloor \frac{9999}{80} \rfloor = \lfloor 124.9875 \rfloor = 124 \]

So, the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

\[ 124 \times 80 = 9920 \]

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - If we fold along the length, each part will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given by:

     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - If we fold along the width, each part will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given by:

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

From Equation 1:
\[ l = 48 - 2w \]

Substitute \( l = 48 - 2w \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2w) + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4w + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3w = 66 \]
\[ 3w = 96 - 66 \]
\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ l + 2(10) = 48 \]
\[ l + 20 = 48 \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

Now, we have the dimensions of the original sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.

d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
\]

Adding these values:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = 5\sqrt{10}
\]

Now, we approximate \(5\sqrt{10}\):

\[
\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623
\]

Thus:

\[
5\sqrt{10} \approx 5 \times 3.1623 = 15.8115
\]

The closest choice to this value is:

\[
\boxed{15.8113}

35,,"A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
A)3km
B)2km
C)4km
D)5km
E)6km",A,"To solve this problem, we need to track the movements of A step by step and determine the final position relative to the starting point.

1. A starts at the origin (0, 0).
2. A travels 3 km south: This moves A to (0, -3).
3. A travels 5 km east: This moves A to (5, -3).
4. A travels 3 km north: This moves A to (5, 0).
5. A travels 2 km west: This moves A to (3, 0).

Now, we need to calculate the distance from the final position (3, 0) to the starting point (0, 0). This is simply the horizontal distance, as the y-coordinate is the same for both points.

The distance is 3 km.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 3km",True,,,,,
36,,"While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
A)Rs. 697.50
B)Rs. 712.50
C)Rs. 787.50
D)Rs. 750
E)Rs. 780",D,"To solve this problem, let's denote the marked price of the watch as \( M \).

When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price with 5% discount} = M - 0.05M = 0.95M \]

When the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price with 7% discount} = M - 0.07M = 0.93M \]

According to the problem, the difference in profit between giving a 5% discount and a 7% discount is Rs. 15. This means:
\[ (0.95M - \text{Cost Price}) - (0.93M - \text{Cost Price}) = 15 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.95M - 0.93M = 15 \]
\[ 0.02M = 15 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = \frac{15}{0.02} = 750 \]

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

The correct choice is:

37,,"A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
A)1584
B)2520
C)1728
D)1656
E)None",A,"Let's denote the number as \( x \).

The student was supposed to find \( \frac{7}{8} \times x \), but instead found \( \frac{7}{18} \times x \).

The difference between the correct answer and the student's answer is 770:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
\]

To solve for \( x \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

Convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{8 \times 9} = \frac{63}{72}
\]

\[
\frac{7}{18} = \frac{7 \times 4}{18 \times 4} = \frac{28}{72}
\]

Substitute these into the equation:

\[
\frac{63}{72}x - \frac{28}{72}x = 770
\]

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{63 - 28}{72}x = 770
\]

\[
\frac{35}{72}x = 770
\]

Solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{35}{72}\):

\[
x = 770 \times \frac{72}{35}

Calculate:

\[

38,,"The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"To find the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we can set up the equation based on the given salary structure:

\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want the salary \( S \) to be $1500:

\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Subtract $500 from both sides:

\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for Sales:

\[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

\[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. The correct choice is:

- Time to travel the first side at 200 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
- Time to travel the second side at 400 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours
- Time to travel the third side at 600 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours
- Time to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours

The total time taken is:
\[
\frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}
\]

To simplify, we find a common denominator, which is 2400:
\[
\frac{12d}{2400} + \frac{6d}{2400} + \frac{4d}{2400} + \frac{3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400}
\]

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}} = \frac{4d \times 2400}{25d} = \frac{9600}{25} = 384 \text{ km/hr}
\]

Thus, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \) and the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).

We have two equations based on the problem statement:

1. The total number of sharpeners is 18:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. The total cost is 100 rupees, and each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees, then the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost equation is:
   \[
   w(x + 1) + bx = 100
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

From the first equation, express \( w \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
w = 18 - b
\]

Substitute \( w = 18 - b \) into the second equation:
\[
(18 - b)(x + 1) + bx = 100
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
(18 - b)x + (18 - b) + bx = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
18x - bx + 18 - b + bx = 100
\]

The \( bx \) terms cancel out:
\[
18x + 18 - b = 100
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( b \):
\[
18x + 18 = 100 + b
\]

\[
b = 18x + 18 - 100
\]

\[
b = 18x - 82
\]

Now, substitute back into the first equation to find \( w \) and \( b \) values that satisfy both equations. We need integer solutions for \( w \) and \( b \).

Let's test the choices:

A) \( w = 10, b = 8 \)
   - Check: \( w + b = 10 + 8 = 18 \) (satisfied)
   - Cost: \( 10(x + 1) + 8x = 100 \)
   - Simplify: \( 10x + 10 + 8x = 100 \)
   - \( 18x + 10 = 100 \)
   - \( 18x = 90 \)
   - \( x = 5 \)
   - Cost check: \( 10(5 + 1) + 8(5) = 60 + 40 = 100 \) (satisfied)

A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining portion of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B \( \frac{1}{1/8} = 8 \) hours to fill the pool alone.

E)None of these",A,"To find out how much sale the servant needs to make to achieve a monthly income of 6000, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the amount of sales in Rupees.

The servant's total income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission from sales. The fixed salary is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the sales, which is \( 0.15x \).

The equation for the total income is:
\[ 1500 + 0.15x = 6000 \]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

Now, we need to find out by what percentage the reduced price (70%) should be increased to bring it back to the original price (100%).

Let's denote the percentage increase needed as \( x \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 70\% \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 100\% \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{100}{70} \]
\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{10}{7} \]
\[ \frac{x}{100} = \frac{10}{7} - 1 \]
\[ \frac{x}{100} = \frac{10}{7} - \frac{7}{7} \]
\[ \frac{x}{100} = \frac{3}{7} \]

Now, multiply both sides by 100 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3}{7} \times 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{300}{7} \]

     \[
     5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125

2. **Determine how many faces of these smaller cubes remain unpainted:**

   - The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, which means all the cubes on the outermost layer have at least one face painted.

   - The cubes that are not on the outermost layer are the ones that form the inner hollow part, which is a 3x3x3 cube. These cubes are not exposed to the outer surface, so none of their faces are painted.

   - The number of smaller cubes in the inner 3x3x3 cube is 27, and since none of their faces are painted, all 6 faces of each of these 27 cubes remain unpainted.

   - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is:
     \[

   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored.

3. **Determine the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates:**
   - Given: 90% of the remaining chocolates (which are vanilla) are squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% of 90% = 0.9 * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla chocolates.

4. **Determine the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla chocolates, the remaining vanilla chocolates that are not squashed are 90% - 81% = 9%.

Thus, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"To solve this problem, let's first define the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers. Let the first number be \( x \). Then the numbers are \( x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \).

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20
\]

According to the problem, when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}
\]

This expression, \(\frac{x + 4}{2}\), must be a perfect square. Let it be equal to \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer:
\[
\frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \implies x + 4 = 2n^2 \implies x = 2n^2 - 4
\]

Since \( x \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( n \) such that \( x \) is a two-digit odd number.

Let's test some values of \( n \):

1. \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   x = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 9 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad (\text{not odd})

2. \( n = 4 \):
   \[

3. \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   x = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 25 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \quad (\text{not odd})

4. \( n = 6 \):
   \[
   x = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 36 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad (\text{not odd})

   \[
   x = 2(8)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 64 - 4 = 128 - 4 = 124 \quad (\text{not a two-digit number})
   \]

Let's try \( n = 5 \) again, but consider the next odd number:
   \[
   x = 47 \quad (\text{odd and two-digit})

Now, let's verify if 47 can be one of the numbers:
- The numbers would be 47, 49, 51, 53, 55.
- Their sum is \( 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255 \).

- Their sum is \( 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355 \).
- Dividing by 10 gives \( 35.5 \), which is not a perfect square.

Let's try \( n = 7 \) again, but consider the next odd number:

D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as \( q \), \( r \), and \( t \) respectively.

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:
\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

From these equations, we can equate:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we don't need to substitute further. We need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation holds true, confirming that the difference \( r - q \) is equal to \( q - t \).

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:
\[ r - q = q - t = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can solve for \( r \) and \( t \) in terms of each other, but the exact values of \( r \) and \( t \) are not needed to find the difference \( r - q \).

Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is definitely:
\[ r - q = q - t = 25 - t \]

Since the problem does not provide specific values for \( r \) and \( t \), the difference cannot be determined from the given information alone.

- \( R \) as the total runs scored before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's batting average before the finals is 51:

\[ \frac{R}{x} = 51 \]

This implies:

\[ R = 51x \]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, so his total runs become \( R + 78 \), and the total matches become \( x + 1 \).

After the finals, his batting average is 54:

\[ \frac{R + 78}{x + 1} = 54 \]

Substitute \( R = 51x \) into the equation:

\[ \frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1) \]

\[ 51x + 78 = 54x + 54 \]

\[ 78 - 54 = 54x - 51x \]

Let's denote the number of letters as \( n \).

1. **Single Letter Codes**: There are \( n \) possible single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of different pairs of letters is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 letters from \( n \) letters.

The total number of unique codes (single letters and pairs) is:

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

Taking the square root of the discriminant:
\[ \sqrt{2401} = 49 \]

Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

Now that we have the dimensions of the rectangle, we can calculate the perimeter:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement for vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%

   - To make 20 large cakes, the total time required is \( \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{2 \text{ large cakes/hr}} = 10 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Small Cakes:**

   - To make 700 small cakes, the total time required is \( \frac{700 \text{ small cakes}}{35 \text{ small cakes/hr}} = 20 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we need to find the number of helpers required to complete both tasks in 3 hours:

- For large cakes: 
  - Total helper-hours needed = 10 hours.
  - Helpers needed = \( \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours}} \approx 3.33 \).

- For small cakes:
  - Total helper-hours needed = 20 hours.
  - Helpers needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours}} \approx 6.67 \).

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number for each task:

- Helpers needed for large cakes = 4.
- Helpers needed for small cakes = 7.

Therefore, the total number of helpers required is \( 4 + 7 = 11 \).

- U is the midpoint of ST

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST. Therefore, SU = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

Now, let's find the position of each point on the line:

1. Assume R is at position 0 on the line.
2. Since RS = 5, point S is at position 5.
3. Since ST = 22, point T is at position 5 + 22 = 27.
4. Since U is the midpoint of ST, U is at position (5 + 27)/2 = 16.

Now, we need to find the length of RU:

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
A)126
B)77
C)88
D)66
E)54",A,"Let's denote the train fare for one person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for one person is:

\[
\text{Bus fare for one person} = \frac{2}{3} \times x = \frac{4}{3}x
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train:

- Total bus fare for 6 persons: \( 6 \times \frac{4}{3}x = 8x \)
- Total train fare for 8 persons: \( 8 \times x = 8x \)

The total fare paid by all the persons is given as Rs.1512:

\[
8x + 8x = 1512

\[
16x = 1512
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1512}{16} = 94.5
\]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the bus fare for one person:

The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so:

\[
\text{Bus fare for two persons} = \frac{4}{3}x
\]

Thus, the bus fare for one person is:

\[
\text{Bus fare for one person} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x
\]

Re-evaluating the total fare:

- Total bus fare for 6 persons: \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 4x \)
- Total train fare for 8 persons: \( 8 \times x = 8x \)

The total fare paid by all the persons is given as Rs.1512:

\[
4x + 8x = 1512

\[
12x = 1512

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1512}{12} = 126

1. **Width of the pickets**: Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are x pickets. So, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Spaces between the pickets**: There are x pickets, which means there are \( x - 1 \) spaces between them. Each space is 6 inches wide, so the total space is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. We need to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population two years from now can be expressed as:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that this future population is exactly double the population of one year ago:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

To find the population increase over the last year, we need to determine the population one year ago compared to the current population. Let's denote the current population as \( P_{\text{current}} \).

Since \( P \times 1.21 = 2P \), we can solve for the current population:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.21 / 1.1 = P \times 1.1 \]

This means the population increased by 10% over the last year.

However, the problem asks for the percent increase over the last year, which is the increase from \( P \) to \( P_{\text{current}} \).

Since \( P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \), the percent increase is:

\[ \frac{P_{\text{current}} - P}{P} \times 100\% = \frac{P \times 1.1 - P}{P} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Since \( P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \), we have:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times (P \times 1.1) / (1 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 1.21 = 2.2 / (1 + x) \]

\[ 1 + x = 2.2 / 1.21 \]

\[ 1 + x = 1.81818 \]

Let the amount of money Arjun has be \( A \) and the amount Sajal has be \( S \).

1. **First Condition:**
   - If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     S + 30 = 2A - 60

2. **Second Condition:**
   - If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     A + 10 = 3(S - 10)

     \[
     A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

Now, we have two equations:
- Equation 1: \( S = 2A - 90 \)
- Equation 2: \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40

\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40

\[
A = 6A - 310

S = 2(62) - 90

E)64",A,"To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation:

1. We have a square piece of cloth. Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \).

2. The square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. This means the new dimensions of the rectangle are \( s \) (the original side length) and \( s - 4 \) (the trimmed side).

3. This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right-angled triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

The area of the rectangle is split equally between the two triangles, so the total area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}

Substituting the dimensions of the rectangle, we have:
\[
s \times (s - 4) = 140

Expanding and rearranging the equation gives:
\[
s^2 - 4s = 140
\]
\[
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576

Taking the square root of the discriminant:
\[
\sqrt{576} = 24

Substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-(-4) \pm 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}

This gives two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10

Since a side length cannot be negative, we take \( s = 14 \).

Now, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
\[
4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56

Thus, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We know that \( M > N \) and the equation \( M - N + 396c = 990 \) holds.

First, calculate \( M - N \):
\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990

Simplify the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990 \implies 99a + 297c = 990

Divide the entire equation by 99:

Now, solve for possible values of \( a \) and \( c \) such that \( a + 3c = 10 \) and \( M > 300 \).

Since \( M = 100a + 10b + c \), for \( M > 300 \), we need \( a \geq 3 \).

Let's find the possible values of \( a \) and \( c \):

1. If \( a = 3 \), then \( 3 + 3c = 10 \) implies \( 3c = 7 \), which is not possible since \( c \) must be an integer.
2. If \( a = 4 \), then \( 4 + 3c = 10 \) implies \( 3c = 6 \), so \( c = 2 \).

For each pair, calculate the number of possible values of \( M \):

- For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \). Since \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, there are 10 possible values of \( M \).
- For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \). Similarly, there are 10 possible values of \( M \).

Adding these, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

- 20% of the students took exactly physics: \( 0.2x \)
- 28% of the students took exactly math: \( 0.28x \)

Since these are exact percentages, the students taking physics and math do not overlap. Therefore, the sum of students taking exactly physics and exactly math is:

\[ 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x \]

This means 48% of the students took either physics or math, but not both. The problem states there are more than 501 students, so:

\[ x > 501 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) that satisfies both the condition \( x > 501 \) and the condition that \( 0.48x \) is an integer (since the number of students must be a whole number).

A)37
B)41

E)43",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Use the information about their ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).

E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze. Since the cow is tethered in the middle of the field with a 14 feet long rope, it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.

The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Substituting the given radius:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]

\[ \text{Area} \approx 615.44 \, \text{sq.ft.} \]

The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. Therefore, the time taken to graze the entire area is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

We know the selling price is Rs 27.50, so:
\[ 1.10C = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

The selling price in this case is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of profit if the book were sold for Rs 25.75 is 3%.

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Since these two possibilities are equally likely, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[
= 180 + 1500

This is essentially finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 13 and 7.

Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 13 * 7 = 91.

We know:
- Total books = 45
- Hardcover books = 30

We want to maximize the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. The maximum overlap occurs when the sum of hardcover and fiction books is greater than the total number of books. In this case, the overlap is the difference between the sum of hardcover and fiction books and the total number of books.

Sum of hardcover and fiction books = 30 + 20 = 50

Since there are only 45 books in total, the overlap (books that are both hardcover and fiction) is:

Overlap = 30 + 20 - 45 = 5

However, this calculation is incorrect because it doesn't consider the maximum possible overlap. The maximum overlap is actually limited by the smaller of the two categories, which is fiction books (20 books).

The cost of newspapers on weekdays (Monday through Saturday) is $1 each, and the cost on Sunday is $4 each. The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each weekday, so it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The total cost for the newspapers for the week is given by:

- Cost for weekdays (Monday to Saturday): \( 6 \times x \times 1 = 6x \)
- Cost for Sunday: \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \)

The total weekly cost is $210, so we can set up the equation:

A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.

Originally, each friend would have contributed Rs. \(\frac{96}{x}\).

However, since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

Now, each of the attending friends has to contribute Rs. \(\frac{96}{x-4}\).

According to the problem, this new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

\[
\frac{96}{x-4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x-4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)
\]

Simplify and expand the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

Cancel out \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

Now, factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives:

\[
x - 12 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 8 = 0
\]

Solving these gives:

\[
x = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -8

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we have \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is:

\[

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- Total amount received by 5 sons = \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \)
- Total amount received by 4 daughters = \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \)

E)1,800",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the sewing machine such that after offering a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit on the cost price.

1. **Calculate the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - Cost Price (CP) = Rs. 1200
   - Profit Percentage = 20%
   - Selling Price (SP) = CP + Profit
   - Profit = 20% of CP = 0.20 * 1200 = Rs. 240
   - SP = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440

2. **Determine the Marked Price (MP):**
   - Let the Marked Price be MP.
   - Discount offered = 20%
   - Selling Price after discount = MP - 20% of MP = 0.80 * MP
   - We know the Selling Price should be Rs. 1440 (from step 1).
   - Therefore, 0.80 * MP = 1440
   - MP = 1440 / 0.80 = Rs. 1800

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, so Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

A)22
B)60

1. **Mark's Situation:**
   - Let Mark's money be \( M \).
   - Let John's money be \( J \).
   - If John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75.
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[

2. **John's Situation:**
   - If Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75.
   - This can be expressed as:

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From the first equation:
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}

Substitute \( M \) in the second equation:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}\left(75 - \frac{J}{2}\right) = 75

Simplify:
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75

\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[
J - \frac{J}{6} = 50

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50

\[
\frac{5J}{6} = 50

Initially, there is 1 water lily, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered. This means that on the 60th day, the lake is fully covered.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can work backwards to find out how many days it would take if we started with 64 water lilies.

1. On the 60th day, the lake is fully covered.
2. On the 58th day, the number of lilies would be half of what it is on the 60th day.
3. On the 56th day, the number of lilies would be half of what it is on the 58th day.
4. Continuing this pattern, we can calculate backwards:

- 56th day: Quarter of fully covered
- 54th day: Eighth of fully covered
- 52nd day: Sixteenth of fully covered

The total amount of work done is calculated as:
\[ \text{Total work} = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days}) \]

For the given scenario:
\[ x \times x \times x = x^3 \text{ units of work} \]

Now, we need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

Using the same formula for total work:

1. **Given Information:**
   - Minor arc AC = 160°
   - Minor arc BD = 150°

2. **Understanding the Bisection:**
   - Since B bisects minor arc AC, arc AB = arc BC.

3. **Finding Arc AD:**
   - We know that arc AB = 80° and arc BD = 150°.

Let's break down the information given:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

First, let's find the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither, 80% take at least one type of vacation.

Now, we know:
- 75% take a winter vacation.
- 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.

To find the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation, we subtract those who take both vacations from those who take a winter vacation:
\[ 75\% - 40\% = 35\% \]

These 35% take only a winter vacation.

Next, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one vacation and 20% take neither, we know:
\[ \text{Summer vacation} = \text{Total vacation} - \text{Only winter vacation} \]
\[ \text{Summer vacation} = 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

This 45% includes those who take both vacations and those who take only a summer vacation. Since 40% take both vacations, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is:

In this problem:

E)5",C,"To find the number of matches the team lost, we first need to determine the total number of matches played. We know that the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.

Let's denote the total number of matches played as \( x \).

The team lost 30% of their matches, so the number of matches lost is \( 0.3x \).

Since the team won 20 matches, the number of matches won plus the number of matches lost equals the total number of matches:

\[ 20 + 0.3x = x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 20 + 0.3x = x \]

Subtract \( 0.3x \) from both sides:

\[ 20 = x - 0.3x \]

\[ 20 = 0.7x \]

Divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{0.7} \]

\[ x = \frac{200}{7} \]

\[ x = 28.57 \]

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round 28.57 to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

Now, calculate the number of matches lost:

\[ 0.3 \times 29 = 8.7 \]

Rounding 8.7 to the nearest whole number gives us 9.

However, since the problem states that the team lost 30% of their matches, and we have calculated the total matches as 29, the closest whole number for the number of matches lost is 9.

But, since the choices provided do not include 9, let's re-evaluate the calculation:

If the team lost 30% of their matches, and they won 20 matches, the total number of matches should be calculated as follows:

Let \( L \) be the number of matches lost. Then:

\[ L = 0.3 \times (20 + L) \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = 0.3 \times 20 + 0.3L \]

\[ L - 0.3L = 6 \]

\[ 0.7L = 6 \]

\[ L = \frac{6}{0.7} \]

\[ L = \frac{60}{7} \]

\[ L = 8.57 \]

Rounding 8.57 to the nearest whole number gives us 9.

Since the choices provided do not include 9, let's check the closest option:

The closest option to 9 is 7, which is choice D.

   \[
   C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ centimeters}

2. **Determine the number of revolutions in 30 seconds:**
   The fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. First, convert this rate to revolutions per second:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Notice that the numerator can be factored as a perfect square:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) simplifies to:

So,

\[ x = 72 + 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} + 4 = 76 + 24\sqrt{2} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we have:

Let's denote:
- A's investment = Rs. 40,000
- B's investment = Rs. 60,000
- C's investment = Rs. 120,000

The profit is shared in the ratio of the product of capital and time.

1. A's investment is for 12 months, so his share is proportional to \(40,000 \times 12\).

2. B joined after 2 months, so his investment is for 10 months, making his share proportional to \(60,000 \times 10\).

3. Let C join x months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined after \(2 + x\) months from the start. Therefore, C's investment is for \(12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x\) months, making his share proportional to \(120,000 \times (10 - x)\).

The total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. Therefore, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is:

   - The radius of each semicircle = diameter / 2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.
   - Area of a full circle = π × radius² = π × (10 cm)² = 100π cm².
   - Area of one semicircle = (1/2) × 100π cm² = 50π cm².
   - Area of two semicircles = 2 × 50π cm² = 100π cm².

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**

Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. Let's assume \( x \) boys and \( x \) girls joined the group. After the new members joined, the number of boys becomes \( 64 + x \) and the number of girls becomes \( 40 + x \).

According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)

Let's denote the distance between A and B as \( d \).

Kevin drove from A to B at a speed of 70 mph. When he was 70 miles away from B, he was still approaching B. At that point, he had been driving for \( \frac{d - 70}{70} \) hours.

After reaching B, he returned to A at a speed of 90 mph. The total time for the return trip from B to A is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.

According to the problem, exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B. This means that the time from when he was 70 miles away from B to the end of his trip was 3 hours.

The time to cover the remaining 70 miles to B at 70 mph is \( \frac{70}{70} = 1 \) hour.

Therefore, the time from reaching B to the end of the trip is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours, and this is equal to the 1 hour to reach B plus the 3 hours after reaching B:

\[

Let the number be \( x \).

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to its one third. This can be expressed as:

\[ x - 30 = \frac{x}{3} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 3:

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x - 90 = x \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)
3. \( 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \)

From the third condition, we can simplify:

\[
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
\]

\[
100a + c - 495 = 100c + a

\[

\[
a - c = 5

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a - c = 5 \)

From the second equation, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
a = c + 5

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into the first equation:

\[
(c + 5) + b + c = 17

\[
2c + b = 12

Now, we have:

\[
c^2 + 10c + 25 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

From the first equation, express \( b \) in terms of \( c \):

Substitute \( b = 12 - 2c \) into the second equation:

\[
2c^2 + 10c + (12 - 2c)^2 = 84

\[
2c^2 + 10c + (144 - 48c + 4c^2) = 84

\[
6c^2 - 38c + 144 = 84

\[
6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0

Divide the entire equation by 2:

\[
3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

\[
c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{(-19)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 30}}{6}

\[
c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{361 - 360}}{6}

\]

\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad c = \frac{18}{6} = 3
\]

Since \( c \) must be an integer, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back into the equations:

1. \( a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \)
2. \( b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 6 = 6 \)

Thus, the number is \( \overline{abc} = 863 \).

1. **Alloy X:**

   - Zinc in 40 grams of X = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
   - Copper in 40 grams of X = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams

2. **Alloy Y:**

   - Zinc in 60 grams of Y = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams
   - Copper in 60 grams of Y = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams

3. **Alloy Z:**
   - Total zinc in Z = Zinc from X + Zinc from Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper in Z = Copper from X + Copper from Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams

4. **Ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**

To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both parts by 3 to eliminate the decimals:

If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh, so the contribution from each employee is \( \frac{624000}{n} \).

According to the problem, the difference in contribution per employee is Rs. 60:

\[
\frac{624000}{n} - \frac{600000}{n} = 60
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{624000 - 600000}{n} = 60
\]

\[
\frac{24000}{n} = 60
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{24000}{60}
\]

\[
n = 400
\]

Therefore, the number of employees in the organization is 400.

A)3267
B)2678
C)2797
D)2300
E)2781",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received.

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage not eligible = 20%
   - Number of ineligible voters = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Ineligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - This means the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate.
   - Let the number of votes the losing candidate received be \( x \).
   - Then, the winning candidate received \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total votes:**
   - Total votes = Votes for winning candidate + Votes for losing candidate
   - 4,000 = 1.15x + x
   - 4,000 = 2.15x

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{4,000}{2.15} \approx 1,860.47 \)

5. **Calculate the votes for the winning candidate:**
   - Votes for winning candidate = 1.15x = 1.15 * 1,860.47 ≈ 2,139.54

Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 2,140. However, this does not match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

- The winning candidate received 15% more votes than the losing candidate, not 15% of the total votes.
- The total votes are 4,000, and the winning candidate received 57.5% of the votes (since 50% + 15% = 65% of the total votes).

6. **Calculate the votes for the winning candidate:**
   - Votes for winning candidate = 65% of 4,000 = 0.65 * 4,000 = 2,600

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.
- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The total earnings equation is:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]
(since $3.40 is equivalent to 340 cents).

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) such that the equation holds true with non-negative integer values for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 25y = 340 - 20x \]
\[ y = \frac{340 - 20x}{25} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 340 - 20x \) must be divisible by 25. Let's check the values of \( x \) starting from the smallest possible value:

1. **If \( x = 0 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{340 - 20 \times 0}{25} = \frac{340}{25} = 13.6 \]
   (Not an integer)

2. **If \( x = 1 \):**

3. **If \( x = 2 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{340 - 20 \times 2}{25} = \frac{300}{25} = 12 \]

1. **Initial Inventory**: The store starts with 600 golf balls.

2. **Golf Balls Sold**: By the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory. 
   - 80% of 600 is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480

4. **Equal Number of Yellow and White Balls Sold**: The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

5. **Determine the Number of White Golf Balls Sold**: Since all white golf balls were sold, and they were sold in equal number to the yellow golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total golf balls sold:

Given:
- Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
- Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
- Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

Let the height of the building be \( h \).

1.25 \text{ bottles/person} \times 12 \text{ people} = 15 \text{ bottles}
\]

However, 15 is not one of the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are interpreting it correctly. 

If we assume the number of bottles should be proportional to the number of people, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ bottles}}{8 \text{ people}} = \frac{x \text{ bottles}}{12 \text{ people}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
10 \times 12 = 8 \times x
\]

\[
120 = 8x
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]

Since 15 is not an option, let's consider the closest logical choice based on the context of the problem. The closest choice to 15 is 14, which is option E.

Therefore, the best choice given the options is:

153,,"Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
A)36
B)28
C)42
D)15
E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The height of the ant and the length of its shadow form a right triangle, and since both ants are standing side-by-side, the triangles formed by their heights and shadows are similar.

For the first ant:
- Height = 4 inches
- Shadow length = 10 inches

For the second ant:
- Height = 6 inches
- Shadow length = x inches (what we need to find)

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{\text{Height of second ant}}{\text{Shadow of second ant}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\frac{4}{10} = \frac{6}{x}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
4x = 60
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{60}{4} = 15
\]

Thus, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.

A)2.6m
B)3.9m
C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. Let's denote the height of the room as \( h \) and the semi-perimeter as \( s \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \implies h = \frac{2}{5}s
   \]

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls:**
   The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter. Therefore, the total length of paper used is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per meter} \times \text{Total length of paper}
   \]
   \[
   260 = 2 \times \text{Total length of paper} \implies \text{Total length of paper} = 130 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Area Covered by the Paper:**
   Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the area covered by the paper is:
   \[
   \text{Area covered} = \text{Total length of paper} \times \text{Width of paper} = 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \text{ square meters}
   \]

4. **Adjusting for Doors and Windows:**
   The area of the doors and windows is 15 square meters, so the actual area of the walls is:
   \[
   \text{Area of walls} = 65 + 15 = 80 \text{ square meters}
   \]

5. **Relating the Area of the Walls to the Room Dimensions:**
   The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height of the room. Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then:
   \[
   P \times h = 80
   \]

6. **Using the Semi-Perimeter:**
   The semi-perimeter \( s \) is half of the perimeter:
   \[
   s = \frac{P}{2} \implies P = 2s
   \]

7. **Substituting the Height:**
   From the ratio, we have \( h = \frac{2}{5}s \). Substituting this into the equation for the area of the walls:
   \[
   2s \times \frac{2}{5}s = 80
   \]
   \[
   \frac{4}{5}s^2 = 80
   \]
   \[
   s^2 = 80 \times \frac{5}{4} = 100
   \]
   \[
   s = 10
   \]

8. **Finding the Height:**
   Now, substitute \( s = 10 \) back into the equation for height:
   \[
   h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4
   \]

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters. The correct answer is:

The sum of \( k \) consecutive integers starting from \(-50\) can be expressed as:
\[
S = (-50) + (-49) + (-48) + \ldots + (-50 + k - 1)
\]

This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = -50 \) and the last term is \(-50 + k - 1\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[
S = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})

Substituting the known values:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times \left((-50) + (-50 + k - 1)\right)

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
(-50) + (-50 + k - 1) = -50 - 50 + k - 1 = k - 101

Substitute back into the equation for the sum:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101)

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \). Plug these values into the formula:
\[
k = \frac{-(-101) \pm \sqrt{(-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102)}}{2 \times 1}

\[
k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10201 + 408}}{2}

\[
k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10609}}{2}

Calculate the square root:
\[
\sqrt{10609} = 103

C)$13.6
D)$22.9
E)$40",C,"To solve this problem, let's first define the original price of each article as \( x \).

When the price decreases by 15%, the new price of each article becomes \( 0.85x \).

According to the problem, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

Let's set up the equation based on the information given:

1. The number of articles Anna could buy at the original price is \( \frac{300}{x} \).
2. The number of articles Anna can buy at the new price is \( \frac{300}{0.85x} \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:

\[
\frac{300}{0.85x} = \frac{300}{x} + 5
\]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply through by \( 0.85x \cdot x \) to clear the denominators:

\[
300x = 300 \cdot 0.85x + 5 \cdot 0.85x \cdot x
\]

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
300x = 255x + 4.25x^2

- 70% clay = 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg of clay

Let \( x \) be the amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand. After removing \( x \) kg of the mixture, the remaining mixture will be \( 10 - x \) kg.

The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is:
\[ 0.3(10 - x) \]

The amount of clay in the remaining mixture is:

We replace the removed mixture with \( x \) kg of pure sand, so the total amount of sand becomes:
\[ 0.3(10 - x) + x \]

We want the final mixture to have equal amounts of sand and clay, i.e., 50% each. Therefore, the amount of sand should equal the amount of clay:
\[ 0.3(10 - x) + x = 0.7(10 - x) \]

Solving this equation:

- Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is \( \frac{C}{5} \) per hour.
- Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is \( \frac{C}{4} \) per hour.

When they work together, their combined rate of earning is:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20:
\[

E)11 Trousers",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trousers and shirts the man can buy with 810 rupees, given that trousers cost 70 rupees each and shirts cost 30 rupees each. We want to maximize the number of trousers purchased.

Let's denote the number of trousers as \( T \) and the number of shirts as \( S \).

The cost equation is:
\[ 70T + 30S = 810 \]

To maximize the number of trousers, we should first calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be bought with 810 rupees.

First, calculate the maximum number of trousers:
\[ T = \left\lfloor \frac{810}{70} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 11.57 \right\rfloor = 11 \]

If the man buys 11 trousers, the cost will be:
\[ 70 \times 11 = 770 \]

This leaves:
\[ 810 - 770 = 40 \] rupees for shirts.

With 40 rupees, the man can buy:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{40}{30} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.33 \right\rfloor = 1 \] shirt.

So, the man can buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt.

The ratio of trousers to shirts is:

B)$6.73
C)$5.73
D)$4.73
E)$3.73",E,"To find the cover price per issue, we first need to determine the total cover price for 15 issues without the discount.

The subscription cost of $42.00 represents a 25% savings off the total cover price. This means that $42.00 is 75% of the total cover price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let \( x \) be the total cover price for 15 issues. According to the problem, 75% of \( x \) is $42.00. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.75x = 42.00 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 0.75:

\[ x = \frac{42.00}{0.75} \]

\[ x = 56.00 \]

So, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.00.

Now, to find the cover price per issue, divide the total cover price by the number of issues:

\[ \text{Cover price per issue} = \frac{56.00}{15} \]

Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each Head, and Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each Tail. Since neither won or lost any amount, the total money exchanged is zero. Therefore, we have the equation:

D)84 km
E)48km",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between X and Y given the conditions of their travel.

Let's denote the distance between X and Y as \( d \).

1. **First Meeting:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time and meet for the first time somewhere between X and Y.
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time taken for their first meeting.
   - Allen's speed = 54 km/h, so he covers \( 54t_1 \) km.
   - Bob's speed = 78 km/h, so he covers \( 78t_1 \) km.
   - Since they meet, the sum of the distances they cover is equal to \( d \):
     \[
     54t_1 + 78t_1 = d

     \[
     132t_1 = d

2. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and then returns towards X, while Bob continues to X and then returns towards Y.
   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time from the start until their second meeting.
   - Allen's total distance by the second meeting = \( 54t_2 \).
   - Bob's total distance by the second meeting = \( 78t_2 \).

   - In 2 hours, Allen covers \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) km.
   - In 2 hours, Bob covers \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) km.
   - The total distance they cover together in 2 hours is:

- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \) (12% annual interest rate)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded every six months)
- \( t = 1 \) year

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2} \]

\[ A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 \]

\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]

\[ A = 5618 \]

The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:

D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot and then find the cost of gardening that area.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 metres.
   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the plot.

2. **Finding the Dimensions of the Plot:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
   - Given \( P = 340 \), we have: \( 2(l + w) = 340 \) or \( l + w = 170 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Boundary:**
   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the plot, so it forms a larger rectangle around the original plot.
   - The dimensions of the larger rectangle are \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \).
   - The area of the larger rectangle is: \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \).
   - The area of the original rectangle is: \( l \times w \).

4. **Area of the Boundary:**
   - The area of the boundary is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original rectangle:

A)20 min
B)22 min
C)23 min
D)21 min
E)20 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which A and B can construct the wall together.

1. **Find the rate of A and B individually:**
   - A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so A's rate is \( \frac{1}{40} \) of the wall per minute.
   - B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so B's rate is \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

2. **Find the combined rate of A and B:**
   - The combined rate when both work together is the sum of their individual rates:
     \[
     \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined rate:**
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360.
   - Convert each rate to have the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360}, \quad \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360}
     \]
   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time taken to construct the wall together:**
   - The combined rate is \( \frac{17}{360} \) of the wall per minute, so the time taken to construct the whole wall is the reciprocal of this rate:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{360}{17} \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert the time to minutes:**
   - Calculate \( \frac{360}{17} \):

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
A)43 seconds
B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.

First, let's calculate the length of the train. We know that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, and it is traveling at 120 miles per hour. 

Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second:
\[ 120 \text{ miles per hour} = \frac{120}{3600} \text{ miles per second} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second} \]

In 3 seconds, the train travels:
\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles} \]

So, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel. The train must travel the length of the tunnel plus its own length to completely pass through.

The total distance to travel is:
\[ 1 \text{ mile (tunnel)} + \frac{1}{10} \text{ mile (train)} = \frac{11}{10} \text{ miles} \]

Now, calculate the time to travel \(\frac{11}{10}\) miles at \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles per second:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\frac{11}{10}}{\frac{1}{30}} = \frac{11}{10} \times 30 = 33 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the train takes 33 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel.

D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered by the terms 4/30, n/100.

The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

First, calculate the discount amount:
- The invoice amount is $20,000.
- The discount is 4% of $20,000, which is \(0.04 \times 20,000 = 800\).

If the merchant takes the discount, he pays:
- $20,000 - $800 = $19,200.

The merchant saves $800 by paying within 30 days instead of paying the full amount in 100 days.

Next, calculate the interest rate that would make borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (the difference between 100 days and 30 days) equivalent to the $800 saved.

The interest formula is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the interest is $800, the principal is $19,200, and the time is 70 days (expressed as a fraction of a year, \( \frac{70}{365} \)).

Set up the equation:
\[ 800 = 19,200 \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{70}{365} \]

Solve for the rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70} \]

Calculate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{292,000}{1,344,000} \]

\[ \text{Rate} = 0.21705 \]

Convert the rate to a percentage:
\[ \text{Rate} = 0.21705 \times 100 = 21.705\% \]

The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 21.705%.

First, determine the weight of one part in the ratio:
- The rice part of the ratio is 2, and it corresponds to 3 pounds.
- Therefore, 1 part corresponds to \( \frac{3}{2} \) pounds.

Now, calculate the weight of the corn:

Let \( s \) be the cost of one soda in cents, and \( e \) be the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( s + 2e = 150 \)
2. \( 2s + 3e = 300 \)

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):

\[
2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150 \\
2s + 4e = 300

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:

\[
(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300 \\
4e - 3e = 0 \\
e = 0

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the first equation:

\[
s + 2(0) = 150 \\
s = 150

Now we know that \( s = 150 \) and \( e = 0 \).

Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

Thus, the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars is 900.

1. **Determine the total revenue from selling 7200 pens:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

2. **Calculate the total number of pens that need to be produced:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, only 90% of the pens are non-defective and can be sold.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens produced.
   - 90% of \( x \) should equal 7200 (the number of pens delivered).
   - \( 0.9x = 7200 \)
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \).

3. **Determine the total manufacturing cost:**
   - The company estimates a 25% profit on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the manufacturing cost per pen.
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 8000 \times C \).
   - The profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost.

   - \([2y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( 2y \).

Now, let's consider the relationship between these expressions:

- **Case Analysis:**
  - If \( x \) and \( y \) are both integers, then \( L(x, y) = x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y \) and \( R(x, y) = 2x + 2y \). So, \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \).
  - If \( x \) and \( y \) are not integers, then \( [x] \leq x < [x] + 1 \) and \( [y] \leq y < [y] + 1 \). Therefore, \( [x + y] \leq x + y < [x + y] + 1 \).

- **Inequality Analysis:**
  - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \) can be less than, equal to, or greater than \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \) depending on the fractional parts of \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's break it down:

1. **Probability that Alan answers correctly**: Alan guesses, so the probability is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability that Roger answers correctly by cheating**: Roger cheats, so the probability is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Probability that Peter answers correctly**: Peter calculates, so the probability is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

We want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

- **Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger does not**: 
  - Probability that Alan is correct: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
  - Probability that Roger is incorrect: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \)

- **Probability that Peter answers correctly and Roger does not**:
  - Probability that Peter is correct: \( \frac{5}{6} \)
  - Probability that Roger is incorrect: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \)

Now, we add these probabilities together to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:

\[

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 18 is 90.

- Convert \( \frac{5}{18} \) to a fraction with denominator 90:
  \[
  \frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{90}

Add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{90} + \frac{25}{90} = \frac{31}{90}

However, this result does not match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are considering the correct scenario.

Upon re-evaluation, the correct interpretation is that we need the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, without considering Roger's cheating. This means we should not include Roger's probability at all in the calculation.

Thus, the correct probability is simply the sum of the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly:

\[
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6}
\]

Convert to a common denominator of 30:

- \( \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{30} \)
- \( \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{30} \)

Add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} = \frac{31}{30}

This result is incorrect, indicating a miscalculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

The correct approach is to consider the probability of Alan or Peter answering correctly, without considering Roger's cheating:

- Probability that Alan answers correctly: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
- Probability that Peter answers correctly: \( \frac{5}{6} \)

The probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly (without considering Roger) is:

200,,"The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is?
A)10%
B)12%
C)6%
D)8%
E)4%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest where the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's denote:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
- Time (T) = 2 years
- Rate of interest (R) = ?

The formula for Simple Interest (S.I.) is:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

The formula for Compound Interest (C.I.) is:
\[ \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

The difference between C.I. and S.I. is given as Rs. 72:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72 \]

Substitute the formulas for C.I. and S.I. into the equation:
\[ P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = 72 \]

Substitute P = 5000 and T = 2:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplify:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5000 to simplify:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{100R}{5000} = \frac{72}{5000} \]

\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Now, let's solve for R by testing the given options:

**Option A: R = 10%**

Calculate the S.I.:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{5000 \times 10 \times 2}{100} = 1000 \]

Calculate the C.I.:
\[ \text{C.I.} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 \]
\[ = 5000 \left(1.1\right)^2 - 5000 \]
\[ = 5000 \times 1.21 - 5000 \]
\[ = 6050 - 5000 \]
\[ = 1050 \]

Difference:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 1050 - 1000 = 50 \]

This is not equal to 72, so option A is incorrect.

**Option B: R = 12%**

Calculate the S.I.:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{5000 \times 12 \times 2}{100} = 1200 \]

Calculate the C.I.:
\[ \text{C.I.} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{12}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 \]
\[ = 5000 \left(1.12\right)^2 - 5000 \]
\[ = 5000 \times 1.2544 - 5000 \]
\[ = 6272 - 5000 \]
\[ = 1272 \]

Difference:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 1272 - 1200 = 72 \]

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( V \) be the number of files infected by a virus.
- Let \( W \) be the number of files infected by a worm.
- Let \( B \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- Let \( W_{\text{only}} \) be the number of files infected only by a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( V + W - B = 250 \) (since all files are infected by at least one of the two).
2. \( W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B \).
3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).

Now, let's express \( W \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( W = W_{\text{only}} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \).

Substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \) into the equation \( V + W - B = 250 \):
\[
125 + 3.5B - B = 250
\]
\[
125 + 2.5B = 250
\]
\[
2.5B = 250 - 125
\]
\[
2.5B = 125
\]
\[
B = \frac{125}{2.5} = 50
\]

Now, we can find \( W \):
\[
W = 3.5B = 3.5 \times 50 = 175
\]

Finally, the number of files not infected by a worm is:
\[
250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75
\]

Thus, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is \(\boxed{75}\).",False,,,,,

A)2400
B)2500
C)2600
D)2700
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the shares of Mohan and Sohan such that they will have equal amounts when they both turn 26 years old, given that the money is invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum.

Let's denote Mohan's share as \( M \) and Sohan's share as \( S \).

Mohan is currently 23 years old, so his money will be invested for 3 years (until he turns 26).
Sohan is currently 24 years old, so his money will be invested for 2 years (until he turns 26).

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]
where \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) years, \( P \) is the principal amount, \( r \) is the rate of interest, and \( n \) is the number of years.

For Mohan, the amount after 3 years will be:
\[ A_M = M \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = M \left(1.04\right)^3 \]

For Sohan, the amount after 2 years will be:
\[ A_S = S \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2 = S \left(1.04\right)^2 \]

Since they will have equal amounts at the age of 26:
\[ M \left(1.04\right)^3 = S \left(1.04\right)^2 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ M \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816 \]

Dividing both sides by 1.0816:
\[ M = S \times \frac{1.0816}{1.124864} \]

Now, we know that the total amount is Rs. 5100:
\[ M + S = 5100 \]

Substitute \( M = S \times \frac{1.0816}{1.124864} \) into the equation:
\[ S \times \frac{1.0816}{1.124864} + S = 5100 \]

Factor out \( S \):
\[ S \left(\frac{1.0816}{1.124864} + 1\right) = 5100 \]

Calculate the factor:
\[ \frac{1.0816}{1.124864} + 1 = \frac{1.0816 + 1.124864}{1.124864} = \frac{2.206464}{1.124864} \]

Now solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{5100 \times 1.124864}{2.206464} \]

Calculate \( S \):
\[ S \approx 2600 \]

Now, substitute back to find \( M \):
\[ M = 5100 - S = 5100 - 2600 = 2500 \]

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.

E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with dimensions 1 x 30 mm, given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.

First, let's find the volume of the original coin:
- The original coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm.
- The radius of the coin is 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm.
- The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or thickness in this case).

So, the volume of the original coin is:
\[ V = \pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \]

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver in the alloy, each metal occupies half of the total volume:
- Volume of aluminum = Volume of silver = \( \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \)

The weight of the original coin is 30 grams. Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho \) and the density of silver be \( 2\rho \) (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum).

The total weight of the coin is the sum of the weights of aluminum and silver:
\[ \text{Weight of aluminum} = \rho \times 56.25\pi \]
\[ \text{Weight of silver} = 2\rho \times 56.25\pi \]

The total weight is:
\[ \rho \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho \times 56.25\pi = 3\rho \times 56.25\pi = 30 \, \text{grams} \]

Solving for \( \rho \):
\[ 3\rho \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]
\[ \rho = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \]

Now, let's find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum with dimensions 1 x 30 mm:
- The new coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.
- The radius of the new coin is 30 mm / 2 = 15 mm.
- The volume of the new coin is:
\[ V_{\text{new}} = \pi \times (15)^2 \times 1 = \pi \times 225 \times 1 = 225\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \]

The weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is:
\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \rho \times 225\pi \]

Substitute the value of \( \rho \):
\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi \]
\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{10 \times 225\pi}{56.25\pi} \]
\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{2250}{56.25} \]

A)20%

1. **8:00 am feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.

2. **9:00 am feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 2/3 of the food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the original amount.

3. **10:00 am feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 4/9 of the food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (4/9) = 8/27 of the original amount.

4. **11:00 am feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 8/27 of the food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) * (8/27) = 16/81 of the original amount.

Now, we need to convert 16/81 into a percentage to find out what percent of the original food remains in the bowl right before the dog eats at noon.

\[
\frac{16}{81} \approx 0.1975

A)100
B)120

D)200
E)80",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who took the survey.

First, let's define some variables:
- Let \( M \) be the total number of men who took the survey.
- Let \( W \) be the total number of women who took the survey.
- Let \( T \) be the total number of people who took the survey.

From the problem, we know:
1. 60% of the people surveyed were women, so \( W = 0.6T \).
2. Therefore, the remaining 40% were men, so \( M = 0.4T \).
3. Of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars, which means 25% preferred green cars.
4. We are given that 10 men preferred green cars.

Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.25M = 10 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40 \]

Now, we know that \( M = 0.4T \), and we have found \( M = 40 \). So:
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

A)88

C)90
D)91
E)92",B,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach the top of the stairs is similar to the Fibonacci sequence because the boy can reach a step either from the previous step or from two steps below.

Let's define \( f(n) \) as the number of ways to reach the \( n \)-th step. The recurrence relation is:
\[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]

The base cases are:
- \( f(1) = 1 \) (only one way to reach the first step)
- \( f(2) = 2 \) (two ways to reach the second step: either two single steps or one double step)

Now, we calculate the number of ways for each step up to 10:

- \( f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- \( f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
- \( f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
- \( f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
- \( f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
- \( f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
- \( f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \)

B)1
C)1.25
D)1.5
E)2",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much additional orange juice is required to make the orange juice content 60% of the total mixture.

Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which consists of:
- 40% orange juice = 0.4 gallons
- 60% water = 0.6 gallons

Let \( x \) be the additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the mixture becomes \( 1 + x \) gallons.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture. Therefore, the equation is:
\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
\]

Solving for \( x \):
1. Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
   \]

2. Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
   \]

3. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6

4. Combine like terms:
   \[
   0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6

5. Subtract 0.4 from both sides:

So, there are 10 possible ways to select two horses from five.

Next, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways Mr. Jain can select two horses such that one of them is the winning horse. Since there is only one winning horse, we can pair this winning horse with any of the remaining four horses. Therefore, there are 4 favorable outcomes.

The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[ 2272 \equiv 875 \pmod{N} \]

This implies:

\[ 2272 - 875 \equiv 0 \pmod{N} \]

Calculating the difference:

\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]

So, \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the 3-digit divisors of 1397.

First, let's check if 1397 is a prime number or if it has any divisors. We can do this by checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 1397.

The square root of 1397 is approximately 37.4, so we check divisibility by prime numbers up to 37.

- 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- Sum of digits of 1397 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20, not divisible by 3.
- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- For 7, perform the division: \( 1397 \div 7 = 199.571 \), not an integer.
- For 11, alternating sum of digits: \( (1 + 9) - (3 + 7) = 10 - 10 = 0 \), divisible by 11. So, 1397 is divisible by 11.

Dividing 1397 by 11:

\[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]

So, 1397 = 11 × 127. Both 11 and 127 are prime numbers, and 127 is a 3-digit number.

Thus, \( N = 127 \).

Now, we find the sum of the digits of \( N \):

E)5",D,"To determine the minimum number of DVDs you need to rent to make the membership worth it, we need to compare the total cost of renting DVDs with and without the membership.

Without membership:
- Cost per DVD = $4.00

With membership:
- Membership cost = $7.00 per month
- Cost per DVD = $2.00

Let's set up an equation to find the number of DVDs (let's call it \( x \)) where the cost with membership equals the cost without membership:

Cost without membership = Cost with membership
\[ 4x = 7 + 2x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[ 4x - 2x = 7 \]
   \[ 2x = 7 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ x = \frac{7}{2} \]
   \[ x = 3.5 \]

Since you can't rent half a DVD, you need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you need to rent at least 4 DVDs to make the membership worth it.

E)20",E,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much work is left for Jill to do after Jack has completed two-thirds of the work.

1. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so the remaining work is \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\) of the total work.

2. **Determine Jill's rate of work:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate is \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.
   - Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so her rate is \(0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{240}\) of the yacht per hour.

3. **Calculate the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work:**
   - Jill needs to complete \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht.

E)70",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the class given that 2/5 of the children are girls and there are 100 boys.

Let's denote the total number of children in the class as \( T \).

According to the problem, 2/5 of the children are girls. Therefore, the number of girls is \( \frac{2}{5} \times T \).

We also know that the number of boys is 100. Since the boys make up the remaining portion of the class, we can express the number of boys as \( T - \frac{2}{5} \times T \).

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times T = 100 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = \frac{100 \times 5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67 \]

Since the total number of children must be a whole number, let's re-evaluate the setup. The number of boys is 100, and the boys represent 3/5 of the class. Therefore, the total number of children should be:

239,,"Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000?
A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000\} \) is relatively prime to 1000.

First, we find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 2^3 \times 5^3. \]

A number is relatively prime to 1000 if it does not share any prime factors with 1000. Therefore, a number is relatively prime to 1000 if it is not divisible by 2 or 5.

We can use Euler's Totient Function, \( \phi(n) \), to find the number of integers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right), \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right). \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 400. \]

So, there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is:
\[ \frac{\phi(1000)}{1000} = \frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5}. \]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

240,,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"To find the original amount of money that Charles invested, we need to use the formula for compound interest. The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8 percent)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

We need to solve for \( P \):

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is approximately $50,000. The correct choice is:

A)45
B)48
C)50
D)55
E)58",C,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let:
- \( j \) be Joe's current age,
- \( s \) be Joe's sister's current age,
- \( f \) be Joe's father's current age.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( j + s + f = 100 \) (The sum of their ages is 100).

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age. So, \( f - j = 2s - s = s \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's father and twice the difference in age between Joe's sister and her father. So, \( f - j = 2(f - s) \).

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 2, we have:
\[ f - j = s \]
So, \( f = j + s \).

Substitute \( f = j + s \) into equation 1:
\[ j + s + (j + s) = 100 \]
\[ 2j + 2s = 100 \]
\[ j + s = 50 \]

Now, substitute \( j + s = 50 \) into equation 3:
\[ f - j = 2(f - s) \]
\[ j + s - j = 2((j + s) - s) \]
\[ s = 2j + 2s - 2s \]
\[ s = 2j \]

Now, we have:
\[ j + s = 50 \]
\[ s = 2j \]

Substitute \( s = 2j \) into \( j + s = 50 \):
\[ j + 2j = 50 \]
\[ 3j = 50 \]
\[ j = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2j = 2 \times \frac{50}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Finally, find \( f \):
\[ f = j + s = \frac{50}{3} + \frac{100}{3} = \frac{150}{3} = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50.

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times x = 21
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times x = 21

Given:
- \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \).

This can be written as:
\[ x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( m \):
\[ x = \frac{4my}{100} \]
\[ 100x = 4my \]
\[ m = \frac{100x}{4y} \]
\[ m = \frac{25x}{y} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \):
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{x}\right) \times 100 \]

Substitute \( m = \frac{25x}{y} \) into the percentage formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\frac{25x}{y}}{x}\right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{25}{y}\right) \times 100 \]

A)26.2%
B)32.8%
C)43.7%
D)59.0%
E)65.6%",E,"To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula for the probability of getting exactly \( k \) successes (in this case, voters who voted) in \( n \) trials (voters chosen) is given by:

\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

where:
- \( n = 5 \) (the number of voters chosen),
- \( k = 4 \) (the number of voters who voted),
- \( p = 0.9 \) (the probability that a voter voted),
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

First, calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):

\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!1!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) \times 1} = 5

Now, substitute the values into the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} (0.9)^4 (0.1)^1

Calculate each part:

\[
(0.9)^4 = 0.6561

Now, multiply these together:

\[
P(X = 4) = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1 = 5 \times 0.06561 = 0.32805

A)58
B)62
C)66
D)70
E)74",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required for the three sides.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is unfenced and is 10 meters, so either \( L = 10 \) or \( W = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the other dimension using the area:**
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters.
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( W \times 10 = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) meters.

3. **Calculate the fencing needed:**
   - The fencing is required for the two widths and one length.

1. **Middle Letter (Vowel):**  
   There are 5 vowels available. The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.

2. **First and Third Letters (Consonants):**  
   There are 20 consonants available. The first and third letters must be consonants and must be different from each other.

   - For the first letter, we have 20 choices (since it can be any consonant).
   - For the third letter, we have 19 choices (since it must be different from the first letter).

3. **Total Number of Codes:**

First, calculate the sum:
\[ 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184. \]

Now, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

The product of these integers is:
\[ (n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1). \]

We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[ n(n^2 - 1) = 2184. \]

Let's try some values for \( n \) to find the correct one:

1. \( n = 12 \):
   \[ 12 \times (12^2 - 1) = 12 \times 143 = 1716. \]
   This is less than 2184.

2. \( n = 13 \):
   \[ 13 \times (13^2 - 1) = 13 \times 168 = 2184. \]
   This is exactly 2184.

Thus, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14.

E)40",A,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance from home to work. We know the worker drives at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour and it takes 9 minutes to reach work.

First, convert the driving time from minutes to hours:
\[ 9 \text{ minutes} = \frac{9}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.15 \text{ hours} \]

Now, use the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 20 \text{ km/h} \times 0.15 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, calculate the time it will take to cycle the same distance at an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour.

D)7
E)8",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each friend eats the candies and then combine their rates to find the time it takes for both of them to finish the jar together.

First, let's find the rate at which P eats the candies. If P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, then P's rate is:
\[ \text{Rate of P} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jar per minute} \]

Next, let's find the rate at which Q eats the candies. If Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, then Q's rate is:
\[ \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{0.5 \text{ jar}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{0.1 \text{ jar}}{1 \text{ minute}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jar per minute} \]

\[ \text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ jar per minute} \]

This means that together, P and Q can eat \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the jar in one minute. To find out how long it takes them to finish the entire jar, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time to finish the jar} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ jar per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]
