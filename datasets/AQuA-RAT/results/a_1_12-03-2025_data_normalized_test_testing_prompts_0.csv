0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote:

- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Using the tangent of the angles, we have:
\[
\tan 45^\circ = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
\]
\[
\tan 60^\circ = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes, so:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[
v = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{10} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 \)).

\[
t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]

\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 15 + 5\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A) 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)}

A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"Let's denote the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

   Subtract \(\frac{x}{2}\) from both sides:
   \[
   0.78x - \frac{x}{2} = 1.90 + 20
   \]

   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   0.78x - \frac{x}{2} = 21.90

   Convert \(0.78x\) and \(\frac{x}{2}\) to a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{78x}{100} - \frac{50x}{100} = 21.90
   \]

   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{28x}{100} = 21.90

   Multiply both sides by 100 to clear the fraction:

   Divide both sides by 28 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2190}{28} = 78.2142857

   Rounding to two decimal places, the original price of the item is approximately $78.20.

C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to calculate the probability that both stocks do not increase.

Given:
- Probability that Stock A increases, \( P(A) = 0.56 \)
- Probability that Stock B increases, \( P(B) = 0.74 \)

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of the probabilities that each does not increase:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = (1 - P(A)) \times (1 - P(B)) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144 \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This implies considering the scenario where the events are not independent and the probability of neither event occurring is maximized.

The greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \]

Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}
\]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so:

\[
1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
\]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300

1. Initially, all marbles in the bag are white.
2. 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and returned to the bag. So, there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.
3. Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. This means the proportion of black marbles in this sample is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

According to the problem, this proportion represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag. Therefore, the proportion of black marbles in the bag is also \(\frac{1}{20}\).

Let \( Q \) be the total number of marbles in the bag. The number of black marbles is 20, so we have:

Let's denote:
- \( P \) as the number of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the number of students who took part in the debating session.
- \( N \) as the number of students who did neither.

According to the problem:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \( P \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \).
- At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so \( D \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \).

We want to maximize \( N \), the number of students who did neither. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:

\[
N = 200 - (P + D - \text{both})
\]

To maximize \( N \), we need to minimize \( P + D - \text{both} \). The minimum value of \( P + D \) occurs when \( P = 90 \) and \( D = 70 \), which gives:

\[
P + D = 90 + 70 = 160

E)280",B,"To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total production cost and the required total revenue.

First, calculate the total production cost for the year:
- The company produces 420 units per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- The production cost per component is $110.

Total production cost for the year = 420 units/month * 12 months * $110/unit = $554,400.

Next, calculate the required total revenue to achieve the desired profit:
- Desired yearly profit = $626,400.
- Total revenue = Total production cost + Desired profit.

Total revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800.

Now, calculate the minimum selling price per component:
- Total units produced and sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.

Minimum selling price per component = Total revenue / Total units = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.29.

3. The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

4. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers rejected is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. Walking 20 steps and then stopping, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. Walking 10 steps and then stopping, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

For the first scenario:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers the remaining \( n - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes, so the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the speed of the elevator is \( \frac{n - 20}{10} = v \).

For the second scenario:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers the remaining \( n - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes, so the elevator covers \( n - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the speed of the elevator is \( \frac{n - 10}{20} = v \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( \frac{n - 20}{10} = v \)
2. \( \frac{n - 10}{20} = v \)

Equating the two expressions for \( v \):
\[
\frac{n - 20}{10} = \frac{n - 10}{20}

Cross-multiply to solve for \( n \):
\[
20(n - 20) = 10(n - 10)

Expanding both sides:
\[
20n - 400 = 10n - 100

Rearrange to solve for \( n \):
\[
20n - 10n = 400 - 100
\]
\[
10n = 300
\]
\[
n = 30
\]

Now substitute \( n = 30 \) back into one of the equations for \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{n - 20}{10} = \frac{30 - 20}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1

A)21
B)30
C)31
D)32
E)None of the above",D,"To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number sold last year is:
     \[
     42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for the first 10 months.
   - So, the total number sold in the first 10 months is:
     \[
     20 \text{ ovens/month} \times 10 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ ovens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22-month period:**
   - Add the totals from last year and the first 10 months of this year:
     \[
     504 \text{ ovens} + 200 \text{ ovens} = 704 \text{ ovens}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Divide the total number of ovens by the total number of months:
     \[
     \frac{704 \text{ ovens}}{22 \text{ months}} = 32 \text{ ovens/month}
     \]

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. The correct choice is:

D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)",D,"To solve this problem, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, in terms of x, y, and z.

Let's break down the information given:

1. The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total score of all students}}{z} = y \implies \text{Total score of all students} = zy
   \]

We want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. This means we need to find the total score of the remaining \(z - 2\) students and then divide by \(z - 2\).

The total score of the remaining students is the total score of all students minus the highest and lowest scores:
\[
\text{Total score of remaining students} = zy - (H + L)

Substituting \(H + L = 2x\) into the equation:
\[
\text{Total score of remaining students} = zy - 2x

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's find out how much profit the grocer makes per bag. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price:

Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25

Next, we need to find out how many bags were sold to make a total profit of $3,000. We can do this by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags = 120

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour to make a $3,000 profit. However, this number is not among the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure there is no misunderstanding.

The problem states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which we calculated correctly. The total profit of $3,000 divided by the profit per bag of $25 indeed results in 120 bags. It seems there might be an error in the problem setup or the choices provided, as none of the choices match the correct calculation.

B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding the equation:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial concentration of tea is 50%.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea in the solution is reduced by 15% of 50%, which is 0.15 * 50% = 7.5%.
   - New concentration of tea = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, John replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea in the solution is reduced by 15% of 42.5%, which is 0.15 * 42.5% = 6.375%.

- \( \frac{1}{16} \) study math
- \( \frac{1}{10} \) study bio
- \( \frac{1}{8} \) study English

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of these fractions (16, 10, and 8) to ensure that the number of students studying each subject is an integer.

First, we find the LCM of 16, 10, and 8:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999.

To find the minimum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80, we divide 1000 by 80:

\[ 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \]

Rounding up, the smallest integer is 13. Therefore, the smallest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is:

\[ 80 \times 13 = 1040 \]

To find the maximum 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80, we divide 9999 by 80:

\[ 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \]

Rounding down, the largest integer is 124. Therefore, the largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is:

\[ 80 \times 124 = 9920 \]

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

\[ 9920 - 1040 = 8880 \]

Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 8880.

The selling price is 40% above the cost price, so it can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is given as $20.00:

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it is folded in half, and the perimeter of the resulting folded rectangle is 48 cm. This means that the folded rectangle has dimensions \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \). The perimeter of this folded rectangle is given by:

\[
2 \left( \frac{L}{2} + W \right) = 48

Simplifying, we get:

When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the folded rectangle has dimensions \( L \) and \( \frac{W}{2} \). The perimeter of this folded rectangle is 66 cm, so:

\[

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1. \( L + 2W = 48 \)
2. \( 2L + W = 66 \)

We can solve this system of equations to find \( L \) and \( W \).

From Equation 1, express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):

\[
L = 48 - 2W

Substitute into Equation 2:

\[
2(48 - 2W) + W = 66

This diagonal will be the diameter of the sphere because the sphere is inscribed such that all vertices of the rectangular solid touch the sphere.

The dimensions of the rectangular solid are 3, 4, and 15. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:

\[

Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \) and the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:
\[ w + b = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:
\[ w(x + 1) + bx = 100 \]

Substitute \( w = 18 - b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (18 - b)(x + 1) + bx = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ (18 - b)x + (18 - b) + bx = 100 \]
\[ 18x - bx + 18 - b + bx = 100 \]
\[ 18x + 18 - b = 100 \]

Rearrange the equation:
\[ 18x - b = 82 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( w + b = 18 \)
2. \( 18x - b = 82 \)

From the second equation, solve for \( b \):
\[ b = 18x - 82 \]

Substitute \( b = 18x - 82 \) into the first equation:
\[ w + (18x - 82) = 18 \]
\[ w = 18 - (18x - 82) \]
\[ w = 100 - 18x \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) that satisfy both equations. We can test the given choices:

A) \( w = 10, b = 8 \)

The servant's total monthly income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission he earns from sales. The equation can be set up as follows:

\[ \text{Total Income} = \text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission} \]

Given:
- Fixed Salary = 1500
- Commission = 15% of Sales

The interest rate can be calculated using the formula for simple interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is Rs.360, the interest is Rs.18, and the time is 1 year (since the installments are monthly over a year).

Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate:

- Each tempo contains 98 boxes, so the number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60 = 5880\) toys.

Now, determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:
- Divide the total number of toys by the number of toys per tempo: \(\frac{29400}{5880} = 5\).

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked.

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Brown = \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Black = \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - Total work needed = 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time for Mr. Blue to complete \( \frac{11}{12} \) houses = \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Determine the total number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part has a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side), so it contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

2. **Determine the number of painted faces:**
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted. The outer cube has 6 faces, each with \(5 \times 5 = 25\) smaller cubes, so there are \(6 \times 25 = 150\) painted faces.

E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we don't need to find individual values of \( r \) and \( t \) to determine the difference between R and Q's age.

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we can express the difference between R and Q's age as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we can substitute back into the equation:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This implies:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = q - t = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( r \) as:

\[ r = 50 - t \]

Substituting back, we have:

\[ r - q = (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 25, which is not listed in the choices. Hence, the correct answer is:

- \( R \) as the total runs scored before the finals.

Given:
- Sachin's current batting average is 51, so:

\[

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[

1. **Single Letter Codes**: There are \( n \) possible single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of different pairs of letters is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 letters out of \( n \).

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

Substituting the values, we have:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150)}}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
or
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth does not make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(l + b) \]

First, let's calculate the total time required to make the cakes:

1. **Large Cakes:**
   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
   - To make 20 large cakes, the total time required is \( \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{2 \text{ large cakes/hr}} = 10 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
   - To make 700 small cakes, the total time required is \( \frac{700 \text{ small cakes}}{35 \text{ small cakes/hr}} = 20 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we need to find the number of helpers required to complete both tasks in 3 hours:

- For large cakes: 
  - Total hours needed = 10 hours
  - Hours available per helper = 3 hours
  - Helpers needed = \( \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours/helper}} \approx 3.33 \) helpers

- For small cakes:
  - Total hours needed = 20 hours
  - Hours available per helper = 3 hours
  - Helpers needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours/helper}} \approx 6.67 \) helpers

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number for each task:

- Helpers needed for large cakes = 4
- Helpers needed for small cakes = 7

Therefore, the total number of helpers required is the maximum of the two, which is 7.

However, since the problem asks for the total number of helpers required to complete both tasks simultaneously, we need to ensure that both tasks can be completed within the 3-hour window. Therefore, we take the maximum of the two rounded values:

- Total helpers required = max(4, 7) = 7

But, since the choices provided do not include 7, we need to re-evaluate the problem. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the calculation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate:

- Total hours needed for large cakes = 10 hours
- Total hours needed for small cakes = 20 hours
- Total hours needed = 10 + 20 = 30 hours

To complete 30 hours of work in 3 hours, we need:

Let \( v \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour. The plane travels at a speed of \( 10v \).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship after it starts.

In that time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( vt \) miles, and the plane travels a distance of \( 10vt \) miles.

Since the plane catches up to the ship, the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane from the starting point is the same when they meet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

- The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, etc.

Now, let's consider the time intervals:

- From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first to arrive.

This pattern repeats every 10 minutes. In each 10-minute cycle, the main line train is the first to arrive for 2 minutes, and the harbor line train is the first to arrive for 8 minutes.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (the harbor line train) is the time the harbor line train is first divided by the total cycle time:

\[ P_1 \times 1.1 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P_1 \):

\[ P_1 = \frac{2P}{1.1} \]

Now, let's find the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P_1 \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P_1 - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute \( P_1 = \frac{2P}{1.1} \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{\frac{2P}{1.1} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left(\frac{2P - 1.1P}{1.1P}\right) \times 100\% \]

3. This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = s \times (s - 4) \]

Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle:

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \). Plugging these values into the formula gives:
\[ s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2} \]

- \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 700 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
- \( M > 300 \) is always true since \( 701 + 10b > 300 \) for any \( b \).

For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\):
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 400 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
- \( M > 300 \) is always true since \( 402 + 10b > 300 \) for any \( b \).

For each pair, \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible values for each pair.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

86,,"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
A)550
B)570
C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the percentages given for students taking exactly physics and exactly math.

Let \( x \) be the total number of students in the school. According to the problem:

- 20% of the students took exactly physics: \( 0.2x \)
- 28% of the students took exactly math: \( 0.28x \)

Since these are exact numbers, the sum of students taking exactly physics and exactly math should not exceed the total number of students. Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.2x + 0.28x \leq x \]

Simplifying the inequality:

\[ 0.48x \leq x \]

This inequality is always true, so it doesn't help us find the minimum number of students. Instead, we need to find the smallest \( x \) that satisfies both the condition of being more than 501 and being a whole number that allows 20% and 28% to also be whole numbers.

Since 20% and 28% must be whole numbers, \( x \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 5 and 25 (the denominators of 20% and 28% when expressed as fractions). The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25.

Thus, \( x \) must be a multiple of 25. The smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501 is 525. However, 525 is not one of the choices. We need to check the next multiple of 25, which is 550.

Let's verify if 550 satisfies the conditions:

- 20% of 550 is \( 0.2 \times 550 = 110 \)
- 28% of 550 is \( 0.28 \times 550 = 154 \)

Both 110 and 154 are whole numbers, and 550 is greater than 501. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

A) 550",False,,,
87,,"If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Use the information about their ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 12 \times 3 = 36

   - So, Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago.

4. **Determine Rahim's current age:**
   - If Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago, his current age is:

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze and then determine how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area.

The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Substituting the given radius:

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find the number of days it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62 days.

However, the closest choice to 62 days is 61 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book.

The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means that the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP).

Let's denote the cost price as \( CP \).

Given:
\[ SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP \]

We know:
\[ 1.10 \times CP = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price, we solve for \( CP \):
\[ CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

New selling price (SP) = Rs 25.75

Profit or Loss = New SP - CP = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75

Since the result is positive, it is a profit.

Profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of profit is 3%.

E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) in a line such that Susan is to the left of Tim.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is given by:

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Since these two possibilities are equally likely, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Thus, there are 3 ways to arrange the children such that Susan is on the left of Tim.

holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500

\[
= 1680

B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again simultaneously. This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation.

Now, find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes:

- The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).
- The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).

Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers and have no common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply their product: 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:

- 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Therefore, both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A)10
B)15
C)18
D)20
E)30",D,"To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the set of hardcover books, with \( |H| = 30 \).
- \( F \) as the set of fiction books, with \( |F| = 20 \).

We want to find the maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states:
\[ |H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \]

We know that the total number of books is 45, so:
\[ |H \cup F| \leq 45 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]

\[ |H \cap F| \geq 5 \]

However, we are looking for the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction. The maximum occurs when the overlap is as large as possible, given the constraints of the individual sets.

Since there are only 20 fiction books, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller set, which is the fiction books. Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:

A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and each of the other weekdays) as \( x \).

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on the other days, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The cost for newspapers on Sunday is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).

The cost for newspapers on each of the other six days (Monday through Saturday) is \( 1 \times x = x \).

The total cost for the week is:
\[
8x + 6x = 14x

We know the total cost for the week is $210, so we set up the equation:
\[
14x = 210

A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.

If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The contribution per person for those who attended is \( \frac{96}{x-4} \).

According to the problem, the contribution per person increased by Rs. 4, so:

\[
\frac{96}{x-4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Multiply through by \( x(x-4) \) to eliminate the fractions:

\[
96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)
\]

2. Simplify and expand:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

3. Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

4. Simplify the equation by dividing everything by 4:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

5. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
\]

6. Solve for \( x \):

The solutions are \( x = 12 \) and \( x = -8 \).

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we have \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} = 88 \, \text{cm} \]

This means the total length of the wire is 88 cm.

Next, we need to find the side length of the square formed by rebending this wire. The perimeter of a square is given by:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side length} \]

Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the total length of the wire, we have:

\[ 4 \times \text{Side length} = 88 \, \text{cm} \]
