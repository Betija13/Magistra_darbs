The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the following:

- \( h \) is the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) is the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) is the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) is the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Using the tangent of the angles, we have:
\[
\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
\]
\[
\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. Therefore, the distance traveled in 10 minutes is:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[
v = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{10} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) it will take for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 \)).

The time \( t \) is given by:
\[
t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]

\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3})
\]

Thus, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) \).

A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Start by simplifying and solving for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.80

   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.80

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}

Given that the profit is 20% of the cost price, we can express the selling price as:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}
\]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
\]

To find the cost price, divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20}

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initially, all marbles in the bag are white.
   - 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and returned to the bag. So, there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. **Second Pull:**
   - Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black.
   - The percentage of black marbles in this sample is \(\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

3. **Percentage Representation:**
   - The problem states that this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.
   - Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.

4. **Calculate Total Marbles \( Q \):**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of black marbles in the bag. We know \( B = 20 \).
   - The percentage of black marbles in the bag is given by \(\frac{B}{Q} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

8,,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the number of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the number of students who took part in the debating session.
- \( N \) as the number of students who attended neither.

According to the problem:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \( P \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \).
- At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so \( D \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \).

We want to maximize \( N \), the number of students who attended neither event. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of students is given by:

\[
P + D - \text{(students who attended both)} + N = 200
\]

To maximize \( N \), we need to minimize the number of students who attended both events. The minimum number of students who attended both can be calculated by considering the maximum overlap possible between the two groups.

The maximum overlap occurs when the sum of the minimum attendees of both events is greater than the total number of students:

\[
P + D = 90 + 70 = 160
\]

This means that at least \( 160 - 200 = 40 \) students must have attended both events. Therefore, the minimum number of students who attended both is 40.

Substituting back into the equation:

\[
P + D - \text{(students who attended both)} + N = 200
\]
\[
90 + 70 - 40 + N = 200
\]
\[
120 + N = 200

\[
N = 200 - 120 = 80

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is 80. However, this number is not listed among the choices. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

If we consider the maximum possible overlap, we can adjust the calculation:

\[
P + D - \text{(students who attended both)} + N = 200

90 + 70 - 60 + N = 200
\]
\[
100 + N = 200

\[
N = 200 - 100 = 100

This calculation shows that the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is 100, but this is not a choice either. Let's check the choices again:

C)240
D)260
E)280",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400.

First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces:

\[ 420 \text{ units/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 5040 \text{ units/year} \]

The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost for the year is:

\[ 5040 \text{ units} \times 110 \text{ dollars/unit} = 554,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The profit is the revenue minus the production cost, so:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Production Cost} \]

We want the profit to be at least $626,400, so:

\[ \text{Revenue} - 554,400 \geq 626,400 \]

Solving for the revenue:

\[ \text{Revenue} \geq 626,400 + 554,400 \]
\[ \text{Revenue} \geq 1,080,800 \]

The revenue is the selling price per component times the number of components sold in a year. Let \( p \) be the selling price per component. Then:

\[ 5040 \times p \geq 1,080,800 \]

Solving for \( p \):

\[ p \geq \frac{1,080,800}{5040} \]
\[ p \geq 214.4444 \]

Since the selling price must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $215. However, we need to choose from the given options, and the smallest option greater than or equal to $215 is $226.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as \( x \).

1. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective.
   - Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).

2. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The remaining staplers are non-defective, which is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

3. **Rejected Non-defective Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
   - Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers rejected is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

According to the problem, 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

First, let's calculate the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:

- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

The combined rate of both machines working together is the sum of their individual rates:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Therefore, we convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

Thus, the combined rate of the two machines is \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate. Let \( t \) be the time in minutes:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

To solve for \( t \), multiply both sides by 18:

\[
5t = 180

- The time taken for the elevator to cover these steps is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the equation is: \( S - 20 = 10v \).

For the second scenario:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken for the elevator to cover these steps is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the equation is: \( S - 10 = 20v \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( v \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v
\]
\[
-10 + 20 = 10v
\]
\[
10 = 10v
\]
\[
v = 1
\]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
A)21
B)30
C)31
D)32
E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the entire 22-month period.

First, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year. Since the average number sold per month was 42, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number sold last year is:

\[ 42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year. The average number sold per month was 20, so the total number sold in the first 10 months is:

\[ 20 \text{ ovens/month} \times 10 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ ovens} \]

Now, we can find the total number of ovens sold over the entire 22-month period by adding the totals from last year and the first 10 months of this year:

\[ 504 \text{ ovens} + 200 \text{ ovens} = 704 \text{ ovens} \]

Finally, to find the average number of ovens sold per month over the 22-month period, we divide the total number of ovens by the total number of months:

\[ \frac{704 \text{ ovens}}{22 \text{ months}} = 32 \text{ ovens/month} \]

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the highest score,
- \( L \) as the lowest score.

From the problem, we know:
1. The average of the highest and lowest scores is \( x \), so:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is \( y \), so the total score for all students is:

We want to find the average score excluding the highest and lowest scores. First, we calculate the total score excluding the highest and lowest scores:
- The total score of the class is \( zy \).
- The total score of the highest and lowest scores is \( H + L = 2x \).

Thus, the total score excluding the highest and lowest scores is:

A)12
B)16

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's calculate the profit made on each bag:

1. The selling price of each bag is $100.
2. The profit percentage is 25% of the selling price.
3. Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:
   \[
   \text{Profit per bag} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]

Now, we know the total profit made is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120
\]

However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the profit calculation:

The profit is actually calculated as a percentage of the cost price, not the selling price. Let's correct this:

1. Let \( C \) be the cost price of each bag.
2. The selling price is $100, and the profit is 25% of the selling price, which means:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 100 - C = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]
3. Therefore, the cost price \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

Now, the profit per bag is $25, as calculated correctly before. So, the number of bags sold is:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120

Let \( x \) be the number of toys made by Alex, and \( y \) be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know from the problem:

1. The total number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob is 35:
   \[
   x + y = 35
   \]

2. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7x \).

3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9y \).

4. Both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, which means:
   \[
   7x \approx 9y

We can solve these equations to find the number of toys made by Jacob (\( y \)).

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - The amount of tea in the solution after this replacement is 85% of the original tea concentration.

- 1/16 of the students study math
- 1/10 of the students study bio
- 1/8 of the students study English

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999.

For each fraction, \( N \) must be divisible by the denominator of the fraction:

1. \( N \) must be divisible by 16 (for math)
2. \( N \) must be divisible by 10 (for bio)
3. \( N \) must be divisible by 8 (for English)

The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 will give us the smallest number that \( N \) must be divisible by. Let's calculate the LCM:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Now, we need to find the maximum and minimum 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

1. **Minimum 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We divide 1000 by 80 to find the smallest multiple:

   \[
   1000 \div 80 = 12.5
   \]

   The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13. Therefore, the smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 13 = 1040
   \]

2. **Maximum 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The largest 4-digit number is 9999. We divide 9999 by 80 to find the largest multiple:

   \[
   9999 \div 80 = 124.9875
   \]

   The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124. Therefore, the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 124 = 9920
   \]

Finally, we find the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers:

\[
9920 - 1040 = 8880

Let's denote the cost price of the appliance as \( C \).

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price \( S \) is given by:
\[ S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

We are also told that this selling price represents a gross profit of $20.00. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
\[ S - C = 20 \]

Substituting the expression for \( S \) from above:

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.4C = 20 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), divide both sides by 0.4:

B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the diameter of the sphere in which the rectangular solid is inscribed. The key is to recognize that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.

The space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

In this problem, the dimensions of the rectangular solid are \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\). Therefore, we can calculate the space diagonal as follows:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250}
\]

Simplifying \(\sqrt{250}\):

\[
\sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10}

To find the numerical value, we approximate \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623\):

\[
d = 5 \times 3.1623 = 15.8115

1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement**: A travels 3 km south. 
   - Moving south decreases the y-coordinate. 
   - New position: (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement**: A travels 5 km east.
   - Moving east increases the x-coordinate.

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Combine the terms with \( b \):

\[ (x + y)b + x = 100 \]

Using Equation 1 (\( x + y = 18 \)), substitute into the equation:

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we have two expressions for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. \( x = 100 - 18b \)

- Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) pools per hour, where \( b \) is the number of hours it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone.

Now, let's analyze the situation:
1. Hose A works alone for 2 hours. In 2 hours, hose A fills:
   \[
   2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool}

Let's denote the sales amount as \( S \).

The commission earned from sales is \( 0.15 \times S \).

- \( x \) coins of 25 paise
- \( x \) coins of 50 paise
- \( x \) coins of 1 rupee

Now, let's convert everything to paise for easier calculation:

- 1 rupee = 100 paise

The total value of the coins in paise is:

- Value from 25 paise coins: \( 25x \)
- Value from 50 paise coins: \( 50x \)
- Value from 1 rupee coins: \( 100x \)

The total value of all the coins is:

\[ 25x + 50x + 100x = 175x \]

We know the total value of the coins is Rs. 700, which is equivalent to 70000 paise. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Next, calculate how many toys are in one tempo:
- There are 98 boxes in one tempo, and each box contains 60 toys.
- Therefore, one tempo contains \(98 \times 60 = 5880\) toys.

Now, we need to find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:

\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days.
   - Therefore, in 1 day, Mr. Brown paints \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house.
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) of a house.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days.
   - Therefore, in 1 day, Mr. Black paints \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house.
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

3. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \).

4. **Remaining work to be done:**
   - The total work required is 3 houses.
   - Work remaining = 3 - \( \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Work remaining = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \).

5. **Calculate the time for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days.

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20
\]

We need this sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square:
\[
\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}

Let \(\frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2\), where \(n\) is an integer. Then:
\[
x + 4 = 2n^2

\[
x = 2n^2 - 4

Since \(x\) is a two-digit odd number, we have:
\[
10 \leq x \leq 99

Substituting for \(x\):
\[
10 \leq 2n^2 - 4 \leq 99

The integer values of \(n^2\) within this range are \(9, 16, 25, 36, 49\). Thus, \(n\) can be \(3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).

Let's calculate \(x\) for each \(n\):

- \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( 0.8x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.10x \).
- The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus the students not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

- Let Q's age be Q years.
- Let R's age be R years.
- Let T's age be T years.

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

1. \( R - Q = Q - T \)

We can rearrange this equation to find a relationship between the ages:

2. \( R + T = 2Q \)

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

3. \( R + T = 50 \)

Now, we have two equations:

- \( R + T = 2Q \)
- \( R + T = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( R + T \), we can set them equal to each other:

4. \( 2Q = 50 \)

From this equation, we can solve for Q:

5. \( Q = 25 \)

Now that we know Q's age is 25, we can use equation 3 to find the relationship between R and T:

6. \( R + T = 50 \)

We also know from equation 1 that:

7. \( R - Q = Q - T \)

Substituting Q = 25 into equation 7:

8. \( R - 25 = 25 - T \)

Rearranging gives us:

9. \( R + T = 50 \)

We already know this, so let's solve for R:

10. \( R = 25 + (25 - T) \)

Substituting equation 6 into equation 10:

11. \( R = 25 + 25 - T \)

12. \( R = 50 - T \)

Now, substituting equation 12 into equation 6:

13. \( 50 - T + T = 50 \)

This confirms that our equations are consistent. Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age:

14. \( R - Q = (50 - T) - 25 \)

15. \( R - Q = 25 - T \)

Since we know from equation 7 that \( R - Q = Q - T \), and we have already found \( Q = 25 \), we can substitute:

16. \( R - Q = 25 - T = 25 - T \)

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:

17. \( R - Q = 25 - T \)

3. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, so his total runs after the finals is \( 51n + 78 \).
4. After the finals, his batting average becomes 54.

The formula for batting average is:

\[
\text{Batting Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs}}{\text{Total Matches}}

After the finals, the total number of matches is \( n + 1 \), and the batting average is 54. Therefore, we have:

\[
54 = \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1}

Now, solve for \( n \):

Multiply both sides by \( n + 1 \):

\[

Expand the left side:

\[

1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth does not make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, we can find the length \( l \) using the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(l + b) \]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( b \), we have:

A)8.5
B)10.5

D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

Let's denote the number of grams of the health food needed as \( x \).

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - Therefore, \( 9x \) percent of the daily requirement is provided by \( x \) grams.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9x \geq 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x \geq \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - Therefore, \( 8x \) percent of the daily requirement is provided by \( x \) grams.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8x \geq 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x \geq \frac{100}{8} = 12.5

To satisfy both vitamin requirements, we need the greater of the two values calculated:
- \( x \geq 11.11 \) for vitamin E
- \( x \geq 12.5 \) for vitamin A

Thus, the minimum \( x \) that satisfies both conditions is \( x = 12.5 \).

Therefore, the number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is \( \boxed{12.5} \).",False,,,

A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to meet the demand for both large and small cakes within the given time.

First, let's calculate the total number of large cakes and small cakes needed:

- Large cakes needed: 20
- Small cakes needed: 700

Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

Let's calculate the total number of cakes that one helper can make in 3 hours:

- Large cakes: 2 cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- Small cakes: 35 cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes

Now, let's determine how many helpers are needed for each type of cake:

1. **Large Cakes:**
   - Total large cakes needed: 20
   - Large cakes made by one helper in 3 hours: 6
   - Helpers needed for large cakes = Total large cakes needed / Large cakes made by one helper
   - Helpers needed for large cakes = 20 / 6 ≈ 3.33

   Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 4 helpers are needed for large cakes.

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - Total small cakes needed: 700
   - Small cakes made by one helper in 3 hours: 105
   - Helpers needed for small cakes = Total small cakes needed / Small cakes made by one helper
   - Helpers needed for small cakes = 700 / 105 ≈ 6.67

   Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, 7 helpers are needed for small cakes.

Finally, we add the number of helpers needed for both large and small cakes:

- Total helpers needed = Helpers for large cakes + Helpers for small cakes
- Total helpers needed = 4 + 7 = 11

However, since the choices provided do not include 11, we need to consider the possibility of optimizing the distribution of tasks among the helpers. 

Let's re-evaluate by considering the total work in terms of equivalent small cakes:

- 1 large cake = 35/2 small cakes (since 1 helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes in an hour)
- Total equivalent small cakes needed for large cakes = 20 * (35/2) = 350
- Total small cakes needed = 700
- Total equivalent small cakes needed = 350 + 700 = 1050

Now, calculate the number of helpers based on the total equivalent small cakes:

- Total small cakes made by one helper in 3 hours = 105
- Helpers needed = Total equivalent small cakes needed / Small cakes made by one helper
- Helpers needed = 1050 / 105 = 10

We know:
- RS = 5

- U is the midpoint of ST

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is equal to the length of UT. Therefore, we have:

\[ SU = UT = \frac{ST}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we need to find the length of RU. We know that:

\[ RT = RS + ST \]

However, this equation doesn't directly help us find RU. Instead, we can use the fact that:

\[ RT = RU + UT \]

We know RT = 17 and UT = 11, so:

\[ RU + 11 = 17 \]

Let's denote:
- \( P \) as the amount of falafel in one pita bread,
- \( R \) as the amount of falafel in one roll,
- \( B \) as the amount of falafel in one baguette.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   3P = R

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:

   Substituting \( R = 3P \) from the first equation, we get:
   \[
   3(3P) = 5B \implies 9P = 5B

   Solving for \( B \), we have:
   \[
   B = \frac{9}{5}P
   \]

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes:
\[
2B = xP

Substituting \( B = \frac{9}{5}P \) into the equation, we get:
\[
2\left(\frac{9}{5}P\right) = xP

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount. Therefore, the discounted price is:
\[ P_{\text{discounted}} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price \( P \). To find the percentage increase needed from the discounted price back to the original price, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Here, the ""New Price"" is the original price \( P \), and the ""Old Price"" is the discounted price \( 0.80P \).

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.20}{0.80} \right) \times 100\% \]

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. We need to find the time it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship after the plane starts.

In that time \( t \):
- The ship travels an additional distance of \( s \times t \) miles.
- The plane travels a distance of \( 10s \times t \) miles.

Since the plane catches up with the ship, the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane from the starting point is the same when they meet.

The equation for the distance traveled by the ship is:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that this future population is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Now, let's solve for the population one year ago in terms of the population two years from now:

Substitute \( P_2 = P_1 \times 1.21 \) into the equation:

Since \( P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + x) \), substitute this into the equation:

Divide both sides by \( P_0 \):

Calculate \( \frac{2}{1.21} \):

Let the amount of money Arjun has be \( A \) and the amount of money Sajal has be \( S \).

According to the first condition:
- If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  \[
  S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
  \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[
  S + 30 = 2A - 60
  \]
  \[
  S = 2A - 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

According to the second condition:
- If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  \[
  A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
  \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[
  A + 10 = 3S - 30
  \]
  \[
  A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
  \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 310
\]
\[
310 = 6A - A

\[
310 = 5A

\[
A = 62

Now, substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 2(62) - 90

\[
S = 124 - 90

\[
S = 34

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation:

1. We start with a square piece of cloth. Let the side length of the square be \( s \) feet.
2. One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are \( s \) feet by \( (s - 4) \) feet.
3. This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right-angled triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

The area of a right triangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

For one of the triangles, the base is \( s \) and the height is \( s - 4 \). Therefore, the area of one triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
\]

Solving for \( s \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
\]
\[
s \times (s - 4) = 140
\]
\[
s^2 - 4s = 140
\]
\[
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
\]

The square root of 576 is 24. So, the solutions for \( s \) are:
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14
\]
\[
s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10
\]

Since a side length cannot be negative, we have \( s = 14 \).

Now, the perimeter of the original square is:
\[
4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56

Thus, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

D)15
E)12",A,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{30} = \frac{3}{5}

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we need to express the numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of the digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We are also given the conditions:
1. \( M > N \)
2. \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

Let's first express \( M - N \):
\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:
\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Now, solve for \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
\[
a = 10 - 3c
\]

Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are digits, \( a \) must be between 1 and 9, and \( c \) must be between 0 and 9. Also, since \( M > N \), \( a > c \).

Let's find the possible values of \( c \) and corresponding \( a \):
- If \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 - 3(0) = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit)
- If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \)
- If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \)
- If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \)
- If \( c = 4 \), \( a = 10 - 3(4) = -2 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a positive digit)

Thus, the possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

Now, calculate \( M \) for each pair:
- For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 100(7) + 10b + 1 = 700 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
- For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 100(4) + 10b + 2 = 400 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
- For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\), \( M = 100(1) + 10b + 3 = 100 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)

We need to find how many values of \( M \) are more than 300:
- For \( M = 701 + 10b \), \( M > 300 \) is always true for \( b = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \) (10 values)
- For \( M = 402 + 10b \), \( M > 300 \) is always true for \( b = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \) (10 values)
- For \( M = 103 + 10b \), \( M > 300 \) when \( 103 + 10b > 300 \) which gives \( 10b > 197 \) or \( b > 19.7 \). Since \( b \) is a digit, no values of \( b \) satisfy this condition.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

- 28% of the students took exactly math.

The number of students who took exactly physics is \( 0.2N \).
The number of students who took exactly math is \( 0.28N \).

Since these are exact numbers, there is no overlap between the students who took exactly physics and those who took exactly math. Therefore, the total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of these two groups:

1. **Calculate the total grazing area:**
   The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2

   Let the cost price be Rs. \( x \).

   \[

Let's denote:

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800

\[
620V - 540V = 240

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

The prime factorization of 13 is 13 (since 13 is a prime number), and the prime factorization of 7 is 7 (since 7 is also a prime number). Since 13 and 7 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product:

LCM(13, 7) = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes

- The number of hardcover books \( |H| = 30 \).
- The number of fiction books \( |F| = 20 \).

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which is the size of the intersection of sets \( H \) and \( F \), denoted as \( |H \cap F| \).

To find the maximum possible value of \( |H \cap F| \), we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the union of two sets:

\[
|H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F|
\]

The total number of books is 45, so:

\[
|H \cup F| \leq 45

Substituting the known values:

\[
30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45

Simplifying:

\[
50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45

\[
|H \cap F| \geq 50 - 45

\[
|H \cap F| \geq 5

Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular day (Monday through Saturday) as \( x \).

According to the problem, the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on a regular day. Therefore, the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday is \( 2x \).

The cost of newspapers is $1 each from Monday to Saturday and $4 each on Sunday.

The total cost for the newspapers for the week is given as $210.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- From Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys \( x \) newspapers each day for 6 days. The cost for these days is:
  \[
  6x \times 1 = 6x
  \]

- On Sunday, the hotel buys \( 2x \) newspapers, and the cost is:
  \[
  2x \times 4 = 8x
  \]

The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for the weekdays and Sunday:
\[
6x + 8x = 14x
\]

We know the total cost is $210, so we set up the equation:
\[
14x = 210
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 14:
\[
x = \frac{210}{14} = 15
\]

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

The correct answer is:

95,,"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation:

Let \( x \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic. Each friend was supposed to contribute an equal amount to cover the total cost of Rs. 96.

The original contribution per person would be:
\[
\frac{96}{x}
\]

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is \( x - 4 \).

The new contribution per person for those who attended is:
\[
\frac{96}{x - 4}
\]

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):
\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

Simplify and expand the terms:
\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:
\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \):
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives two possible solutions:
\[
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]
\[
x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we have \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is:
\[
x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the original rectangle and then use that to determine the side length of the square formed by rebending the wire.

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})
   \]

   Here, the length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. So, the perimeter is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Determine the side length of the square:**

   When the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm.

   The formula for the perimeter of a square is:
   \[
   P = 4 \times \text{side length}
   \]

   Let the side length of the square be \( s \). Then:
   \[
   4s = 88
   \]

   Solving for \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

The correct choice is:

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- The amount each nephew receives as \( x \).
- The amount each daughter receives as \( 4x \) (since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew).
- The amount each son receives as \( 5x \) (since each son receives five times as much as each nephew).

Now, we have:
- 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is Rs 8600. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
43x = 8600
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
\]

Since each daughter receives \( 4x \), we calculate:
\[
4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
\]

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

The correct choice is:

Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?

D)58
E)91",D,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information she provided.

Meenu said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( W \).

According to the statement, we can set up the equation:
\[ W = 29 + \frac{1}{2}W \]

To solve for \( W \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2W = 58 + W \]

Next, we subtract \( W \) from both sides to isolate \( W \) on one side:
\[ 2W - W = 58 \]
\[ W = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
