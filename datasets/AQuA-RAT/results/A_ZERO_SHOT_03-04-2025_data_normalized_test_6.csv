The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( d_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base is \( d_2 \).

1. **Using the angle of elevation of 45°:**
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \implies h = d_1
   \]

2. **Using the angle of elevation of 60°:**
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies h = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

Since \( h = d_1 \) and \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
   \[
   d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

3. **Finding the relationship between \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \):**
   \[
   d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3} \implies d_2 = \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

4. **The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes:**
   \[
   d_1 - d_2 = d_1 - \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} = d_1 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
   \]

5. **Speed of the car:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
   \]

6. **Time to reach the base of the tower (from \( d_2 \) to 0):**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{d_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
   \]

   Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   After applying the $20-off coupon, the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20

3. **Relate to the condition given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

   Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80

First, let's find the prime factorization of each number:

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase, which is 0.74.

The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is the complement of the probability that at least one of them will increase. 

The probability that at least one of them will increase is given by the formula for the union of two events:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

The greatest value for the probability that neither will increase is when the overlap (i.e., both increase) is minimized. The minimum value for \( P(A \cap B) \) is 0, which occurs when the events are mutually exclusive (though this is not realistic for stocks, it gives the maximum probability for neither increasing).

Thus, the probability that neither will increase is:
\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - P(A \cup B) \]
\[ = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)) \]
\[ = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0) \]
\[ = 1 - 1.30 \]
\[ = -0.30 \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, this indicates that the events are not mutually exclusive, and we must consider the realistic scenario where they can both increase. The maximum probability for neither increasing is when they are independent, and we calculate it as follows:

The probability that neither increases is:
\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = (1 - P(A)) \times (1 - P(B)) \]
\[ = (1 - 0.56) \times (1 - 0.74) \]
\[ = 0.44 \times 0.26 \]
\[ = 0.1144 \]

However, this is not one of the answer choices. The problem asks for the greatest value, which implies considering the scenario where the events are not independent and the overlap is maximized. The maximum overlap occurs when one event's occurrence guarantees the other's, which is not realistic here. Therefore, the greatest realistic value is when they are independent, and the closest answer choice to 0.1144 is:

\[ \boxed{0.26} \]

A)270
B)300

The formula for selling price (SP) when there is a profit is given by:

\[ \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit} \]

Where:
- SP is the selling price.
- CP is the cost price.
- Profit is the profit amount.

The profit can also be expressed in terms of the cost price and the profit percentage:

\[ \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{CP} \]

In this problem, the selling price (SP) is Rs. 360, and the profit percentage is 20%. We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ 360 = \text{CP} + \left(\frac{20}{100} \times \text{CP}\right) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 360 = \text{CP} + 0.2 \times \text{CP} \]

\[ 360 = 1.2 \times \text{CP} \]

To find the cost price (CP), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ \text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.2} \]

\[ \text{CP} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Initially, all marbles in the bag are white. We pull out 20 marbles and paint them black, then return them to the bag. This means there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

Next, we pull out another 20 marbles, and 1 of these is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out (1 out of 20) represents their percentage in the entire bag.

The percentage of black marbles pulled out is:
\[
\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%

This means that 5% of the marbles in the bag are black. Since there are 20 black marbles in the bag, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Commission per sale} = 10\% \times 250 = 0.10 \times 250 = 25 \]

This means the salesperson earns $25 for each sale.

Next, we need to find out how many such sales are needed to reach at least $1000 in commission. Let \( n \) be the number of sales required. The total commission from \( n \) sales is:

\[ 420 \text{ units/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 5040 \text{ units/year} \]

The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost for the year is:

Next, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. Therefore, the revenue must be:

\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Profit} + \text{Production Cost} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the selling price per component that results in this total revenue. The total revenue is the selling price per component multiplied by the number of components sold in a year:

\[ \text{Selling Price} \times 5040 \text{ units} = 1,180,800 \text{ dollars} \]

Solving for the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{1,180,800}{5040} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 234.2857 \]

Since the selling price must be a whole number and at least this amount to ensure the profit is at least $626,400, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $235.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as \( x \).

1. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers produced were defective.
   - Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

2. **Non-defective Staplers:**

E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate of production is 1/6 yo-yos per minute. Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate of production is 1/9 yo-yos per minute.

Together, the combined rate of production is:
\[ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Converting each rate to have a denominator of 18, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18} \]

Adding these together gives:

- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.

From the first scenario:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, \( S - 20 = 10v \).

From the second scenario:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.
- Therefore, \( S - 10 = 20v \).

We now have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v
\]

\[
-10 + 20 = 10v
\]

\[
10 = 10v
\]

\[
v = 1
\]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute. Therefore, the correct answer is:

In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
A)21
B)30
C)31
D)32
E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the entire 22-month period and then find the average per month.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwaves sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwaves per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 microwaves/month * 12 months = 504 microwaves.

2. **Calculate the total number of microwaves sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwaves per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold in the first 10 months of this year = 20 microwaves/month * 10 months = 200 microwaves.

3. **Calculate the total number of microwaves sold over the entire 22-month period:**
   - Total sold over 22 months = Total sold last year + Total sold in the first 10 months of this year
   - Total sold over 22 months = 504 microwaves + 200 microwaves = 704 microwaves.

4. **Calculate the average number of microwaves sold per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Average per month = Total sold over 22 months / 22 months
   - Average per month = 704 microwaves / 22 months = 32 microwaves/month.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32.

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's understand what a 25% profit on the selling price means. If the selling price of each bag is $100, then the profit per bag is 25% of $100. 

Calculate the profit per bag:
\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the grocer makes $25 profit for each bag sold.

Next, we need to find out how many bags were sold to make a total profit of $3,000.

Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold. The total profit is given by:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ 3000 = 25 \times x \]

B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the equation:
\[ A + J = 35 \]

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, express \( A \) in terms of \( J \) from the first equation:
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the second equation:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Expanding the equation gives:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]

Solve for \( J \):
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be an integer, and the problem states they worked for almost the same number of hours, we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea concentration is 50%.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - The amount of tea in the 15% of the solution is 15% of 50%, which is 0.15 * 0.50 = 0.075 or 7.5%.
   - After replacing this 15% with milk, the new concentration of tea is reduced by 7.5%.
   - New concentration = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, John replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea in the 15% of the new solution is 15% of 42.5%, which is 0.15 * 0.425 = 0.06375 or 6.375%.
   - After replacing this 15% with milk, the new concentration of tea is reduced by 6.375%.
   - New concentration = 42.5% - 6.375% = 36.125%.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

1. **Math Students**: \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math, so the number of math students is \( \frac{N}{16} \). For this to be an integer, \( N \) must be a multiple of 16.

2. **Bio Students**: \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, so the number of bio students is \( \frac{N}{10} \). For this to be an integer, \( N \) must be a multiple of 10.

3. **English Students**: \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English, so the number of English students is \( \frac{N}{8} \). For this to be an integer, \( N \) must be a multiple of 8.

To satisfy all these conditions simultaneously, \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8.

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM of these numbers is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, the smallest 4-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

- **Minimum \( N \)**: The smallest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 1040 (since \( 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \), rounding up gives 13, and \( 13 \times 80 = 1040 \)).

- **Maximum \( N \)**: The largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 9920 (since \( 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \), rounding down gives 124, and \( 124 \times 80 = 9920 \)).

The dimensions of the rectangular solid are given as 3, 4, and 15. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

Substituting the given dimensions into the formula, we have:

\[ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} \]

Calculating each term:

- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(15^2 = 225\)

Adding these values together:

\[ 9 + 16 + 225 = 250 \]

Now, take the square root of 250 to find the diagonal:

\[ d = \sqrt{250} \]

To simplify \(\sqrt{250}\), we can factor it as:

\[ \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10} \]

Approximating \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.162\), we get:

\[ d \approx 5 \times 3.162 = 15.81 \]

Thus, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.81. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Initial Position:** Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement (South 3 km):** 
   - Moving south decreases the y-coordinate by 3.
   - New position: (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement (East 5 km):**
   - Moving east increases the x-coordinate by 5.

Now, we need to calculate the distance from the final position (3, 0) back to the starting point (0, 0). The distance can be calculated using the distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):

\[

2. **7% Discount Scenario:**
   - The selling price when a 7% discount is given is \( 0.93M \).

According to the problem, the difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15. This means:

Instead, the student found \( \frac{7}{18} \) of the number, which is \( \frac{7}{18}x \).

According to the problem, the difference between these two results is 770. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770

To solve this equation, we first need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72. We convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x = \frac{7 \times 9}{72}x = \frac{63}{72}x

\[
\frac{7}{18}x = \frac{7 \times 4}{72}x = \frac{28}{72}x

C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Let's assume the side length of the square is \( s \).

1. **Total Distance**: The plane flies around a square, so the total distance is the perimeter of the square, which is \( 4s \).

2. **Time Taken**: 
   - For the first side, the speed is 200 km/hr, so the time taken is \( \frac{s}{200} \).
   - For the second side, the speed is 400 km/hr, so the time taken is \( \frac{s}{400} \).
   - For the third side, the speed is 600 km/hr, so the time taken is \( \frac{s}{600} \).
   - For the fourth side, the speed is 800 km/hr, so the time taken is \( \frac{s}{800} \).

   The total time taken is:
   \[
   \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800}
   \]

3. **Average Speed**: The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4s}{\frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800}}

   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800} = s \left( \frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{400} + \frac{1}{600} + \frac{1}{800} \right)

   Finding a common denominator for the fractions:
   - The least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400.

   Adding these fractions:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2400} + \frac{6}{2400} + \frac{4}{2400} + \frac{3}{2400} = \frac{25}{2400}

- Let \( w \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, so we have the equation:

\[ w + b = 18 \]

Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we have the equation:

\[ w(x + 1) + bx = 100 \]

Simplifying the second equation:

\[ wx + w + bx = 100 \]

Since \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute \( b = 18 - w \) into the equation:

\[ wx + w + (18 - w)x = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 18x + w = 100 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( w + b = 18 \)
2. \( 18x + w = 100 \)

From equation 2, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ w = 100 - 18x \]

Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) into equation 1:

\[ (100 - 18x) + b = 18 \]

\[ b = 18 - (100 - 18x) \]

\[ b = 18x - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) such that both are non-negative and satisfy the equations. 

Let's test the options:

- Option A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \)
  - \( w + b = 10 + 8 = 18 \) (satisfies equation 1)
  - Substitute into equation 2: \( 18x + 10 = 100 \) gives \( 18x = 90 \) so \( x = 5 \)
  - Check: \( 10(5 + 1) + 8(5) = 60 + 40 = 100 \) (satisfies equation 2)

- Option B: \( w = 9, b = 8 \)

   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining portion of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Together, their rate is \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \).

6. **Solve for \( \frac{1}{b} \):**

Let's denote the monthly sales as \( S \).

The commission earned from the sales is 15% of \( S \), which can be expressed as \( 0.15 \times S \).

The total interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal:
\[ 378 - 360 = 18 \]

The interest paid is Rs.18 over the principal of Rs.360 for one year (since the installments are monthly over a year).

To find the interest rate, we use the formula for simple interest:

Here, the interest is Rs.18, the principal is Rs.360, and the time is 1 year. We need to find the rate (R).

Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate:

C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains for Mr. Blue to finish.

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

3. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Combined, they have painted \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how the painting affects the smaller cubes.

1. **Outer Cube Dimensions**: The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm.

2. **Inner Cube Dimensions**: Since the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, the inner cube (the hollow part) has a side length of 3 cm (5 cm - 2*1 cm = 3 cm).

3. **Total Number of Smaller Cubes**: The entire 5 cm cube is made up of smaller cubes of 1 cm each. Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes in the 5 cm cube is \(5^3 = 125\).

4. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Part**: The hollow part is a 3 cm cube, which consists of \(3^3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

5. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Shell**: The shell of the hollow cube is the difference between the total number of cubes and the number of cubes in the hollow part. So, the shell contains \(125 - 27 = 98\) smaller cubes.

6. **Painting the Outer Surface**: When the outer surface of the cube is painted, only the cubes that are part of the outermost layer of the shell will have painted faces. 

7. **Unpainted Faces**: The smaller cubes that are completely inside the shell (not on the outer surface) will have all their faces unpainted. These are the cubes that form the inner surface of the hollow cube.

8. **Calculating Unpainted Faces**: The inner cube (3 cm) has 6 faces, each with \(3 \times 3 = 9\) smaller cubes. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is \(6 \times 9 = 54\).

However, the problem asks for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, not the number of unpainted cubes. Each of the 27 smaller cubes in the hollow part has 6 faces, and none of these faces are painted. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

The correct answer is not directly listed in the choices, which suggests a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the choices.

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20. \]

We need this sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}. \]

For \(\frac{n + 4}{2}\) to be a perfect square, \( n + 4 \) must be an even number that is twice a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \), so:

- 4/5 of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.10x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we substitute back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \):

\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms that our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since we already know \( r + t = 50 \), we can solve for \( r - q \):

\[ r - q = q - t \]

Substituting \( q = 25 \) into the equation:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This implies:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can solve for \( r \) and \( t \) individually, but the problem asks for the difference \( r - q \).

Given the equations and the consistent results, the difference \( r - q \) is:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

Since \( q = 25 \), the difference \( r - q \) is:

\[ r - q = 25 - t \]

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51. Therefore, we can write the equation for the batting average before the finals as:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51
\]

This implies:

\[
y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs. Therefore, the total runs after the finals become \( y + 78 \), and the total number of matches becomes \( x + 1 \).

The new batting average after the finals is given as 54. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)

Expand the right side:

\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54

Rearrange the terms to solve for \( x \):

\[
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x

\[

Divide both sides by 3:

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle given its area and the relationship between its length and breadth.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:

\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]

Substituting the given values and expressions, we have:

\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation:

\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation gives us a quadratic equation:

\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

The square root of 2401 is 49. Now, substitute back into the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):

1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:

\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

Now that we have both the length and the breadth, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2(l + b) \]

Substitute the values of \( l \) and \( b \):

\[ P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters. The correct answer is:

A)8.5

D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement for vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: 
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement for vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]

To satisfy both requirements, we need to consume enough grams to meet the higher of the two calculated amounts, since both vitamins must reach at least 100% of their daily requirement.

- For vitamin E, we need approximately 11.11 grams.
- For vitamin A, we need 12.5 grams.

Therefore, to ensure both requirements are met, we must consume at least 12.5 grams of the health food.

C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

First, let's calculate the total work needed in terms of large cakes and small cakes:

1. **Large Cakes Requirement:**
   - 20 large cakes are needed.
   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, one helper can make \(2 \times 3 = 6\) large cakes.
   - To make 20 large cakes, the number of helpers required is \(\frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33\). Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 4 helpers for the large cakes.

2. **Small Cakes Requirement:**
   - 700 small cakes are needed.
   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, one helper can make \(35 \times 3 = 105\) small cakes.
   - To make 700 small cakes, the number of helpers required is \(\frac{700}{105} \approx 6.67\). Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 7 helpers for the small cakes.

Now, we need to determine the total number of helpers required. Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we need enough helpers to cover both tasks. The maximum of the two requirements (4 for large cakes and 7 for small cakes) is 7. However, since the helpers can switch tasks, we need to ensure that the total work is covered.

Let's verify by calculating the total work in terms of hours:

- Total large cake hours needed: \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) hours.
- Total small cake hours needed: \(\frac{700}{35} = 20\) hours.

Total work hours needed = 10 + 20 = 30 hours.

Each helper works for 3 hours, so the number of helpers required is \(\frac{30}{3} = 10\).

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price back from $80 to $100.

The increase needed is:

\[ \text{Increase} = 100 - 80 = 20 \]

The percentage increase is calculated as:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{20}{80}\right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Let's denote:
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_p = 10v_s \) as the speed of the plane, since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship.

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. We need to find the distance from the starting point where they meet, which means we need to find the total distance the ship has traveled by the time they meet.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet. During this time \( t \):
- The ship travels an additional distance of \( v_s \times t \).
- The plane travels a distance of \( 10v_s \times t \).

Since they meet at the same point, the total distance traveled by the ship from the starting point is equal to the distance traveled by the plane from the starting point. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 180 + v_s \times t = 10v_s \times t \]

Solving for \( t \), we get:

\[ 180 = 10v_s \times t - v_s \times t \]
\[ 180 = 9v_s \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9v_s} \]
\[ t = \frac{20}{v_s} \]

Now, substitute \( t \) back into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled by the ship} = 180 + v_s \times \frac{20}{v_s} \]

- The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM. So, the trains arrive at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on.
- The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the trains arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.

Now, consider the time interval from 5:00 AM to 5:10 AM:

- If the man arrives at the station between 5:00 and 5:02, he will catch the main line train at 5:00.
- If he arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train at 5:02.

The total time interval is 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10). The time interval during which the man catches the main line train is 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02). Therefore, the probability that he catches the main line train is the ratio of the time interval for the main line train to the total time interval:

Probability = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval) = 2/10 = 0.2

Thus, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 0.2. However, the problem asks for the probability of catching the first train that comes, which includes both the main line and harbor line trains. Since the man will catch the first train that arrives after he gets to the station, and given the setup, he will always catch one of the two trains within the 10-minute window.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

\[ P \times 1.10 \]

The population two years from now will be:
\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have the equation:

This equation is incorrect, which means we need to re-evaluate our understanding. The correct interpretation is that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, not the original population.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P_0 \), the population now as \( P_1 \), and the population two years from now as \( P_2 \).

Given:
\[ P_2 = 2 \times P_0 \]

We know:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P_1 \times 1.21 \]

\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + x) \]

Where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year.

Substituting the given condition:
\[ P_0 \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_0 \]

Cancel \( P_0 \) from both sides:

- GCF = 11
- LCM = 7700
- One of the integers, \( a = 350 \)

We need to find the other integer, \( b \).

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[
11 \times 7700 = 350 \times b
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
11 \times 7700 = 84700
\]

Now, solve for \( b \):

\[
84700 = 350 \times b
\]

Divide both sides by 350 to isolate \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{84700}{350}

Calculate the division:

\[
b = 242

Thus, the other integer is 242. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Area of the Triangles:**
   - The area of the rectangle is split into two triangles by cutting along the diagonal.
   - The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.
   - Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

4. **Equation for the Rectangle's Area:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its sides: \( s \times (s - 4) = 140 \).

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Expanding the equation: \( s^2 - 4s = 140 \).
   - Rearranging gives: \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \).

6. **Factoring the Quadratic:**
   - We need to factor the quadratic equation: \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \).
   - The factors of -140 that add up to -4 are -14 and 10.
   - Thus, the equation factors to: \( (s - 14)(s + 10) = 0 \).

7. **Finding the Value of \( s \):**
   - Solving for \( s \), we get \( s = 14 \) or \( s = -10 \).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

8. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet. The correct answer is:

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. If we divide this length into 5 equal parts, each part would be:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{5} = 6 \text{ cm per part} \]

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the numbers M and N. 

Given:
- M = 100a + 10b + c (a three-digit number)
- N = 100c + 10b + a (the reverse of M)

We are also given the condition:
- M > N
- M - N + 396c = 990

First, let's express M - N in terms of a, b, and c:
\[ M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) \]
\[ M - N = 100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a \]
\[ M - N = 99a - 99c \]
\[ M - N = 99(a - c) \]

Substitute this into the given equation:
\[ 99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \]

Factor out 99 from the equation:
\[ 99(a - c + 4c) = 990 \]
\[ 99(a + 3c) = 990 \]

Divide both sides by 99:
\[ a + 3c = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the values of M that are greater than 300. Since M is a three-digit number, a must be at least 1. Also, since M > N, a > c.

Let's find the possible values of a and c that satisfy a + 3c = 10:

1. If c = 1, then a = 10 - 3(1) = 7
2. If c = 2, then a = 10 - 3(2) = 4
3. If c = 3, then a = 10 - 3(3) = 1

For each pair (a, c), we can choose any digit for b (0 through 9), since b does not affect the inequality M > N or the equation a + 3c = 10.

Now, let's calculate the number of possible values for M:

- For (a, c) = (7, 1), b can be 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values.
- For (a, c) = (4, 2), b can be 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values.
- For (a, c) = (1, 3), b can be 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values.

Adding these up, we have 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 possible values for M.

Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 30.

- 20% of the students took only physics.
- 28% of the students took only math.
- The total number of students is more than 501.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

The number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \), and the number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).

Since these percentages are of the total number of students, the sum of these percentages should be less than or equal to 100% of the students. However, since they are non-overlapping groups, they can sum up to less than 100%.

The problem asks for the least possible number of students, \( N \), that is more than 501. We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) such that:

1. \( N > 501 \)
2. \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) are integers (since the number of students must be whole numbers).

Let's check the options:

- For \( N = 550 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 550 = 110 \) (integer)
  - \( 0.28 \times 550 = 154 \) (integer)

  - \( 0.2 \times 570 = 114 \) (integer)
  - \( 0.28 \times 570 = 159.6 \) (not an integer)

Since 159.6 is not an integer, 570 does not satisfy the condition.

- For \( N = 600 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 600 = 120 \) (integer)
  - \( 0.28 \times 600 = 168 \) (integer)

Both calculations result in integers, and 600 is greater than 501. However, we are looking for the least possible number, and 550 is smaller than 600.

- For \( N = 700 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 700 = 140 \) (integer)
  - \( 0.28 \times 700 = 196 \) (integer)

Both calculations result in integers, and 700 is greater than 501. However, 550 is still the smallest valid option.

Let's denote Rahim's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Raj is currently 17 years old. Five years ago, Raj was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.

The problem states that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Therefore, five years ago, Rahim's age was three times Raj's age at that time.

So, we can write the equation for Rahim's age five years ago as:
\[ R - 5 = 3 \times 12 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ R - 5 = 36 \]

C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then divide that by the amount the cow grazes per day.

The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Substituting the given radius:

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find the number of days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since the choices provided are in increments of 10, we choose the closest option, which is 61 days.

D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Find the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price.

   Let the cost price be \( x \).

   \[
   1.10x = 27.50

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs 25.75, we compare this selling price to the cost price of Rs 25.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{0.75}{25}\right) \times 100\% = 3\%

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

- The variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Let's denote the number of newspapers bought on a regular day (Monday through Saturday) as \( x \). Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The cost for newspapers on a regular day is $1 per newspaper, so the cost for newspapers from Monday to Saturday is:

Let's denote:
- \( n \) as the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
- \( x \) as the amount each friend was originally supposed to contribute.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the picnic is Rs. 96.
2. Originally, each friend was supposed to contribute \( x \), so \( n \times x = 96 \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( n - 4 \).

The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so the new contribution per friend is \( x + 4 \).

The equation for the new situation is:
\[

We have two equations:
1. \( n \times x = 96 \)

Simplify:
\[

Multiply through by \( n \) to clear the fraction:

Expand:
\[
96n - 384 + 4n^2 - 16n = 96n

E)85",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of red sweets to green sweets, which is 3:4. This means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.

We are told that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, we can set up a proportion to find the number of red sweets.

Let \( x \) be the number of red sweets. According to the ratio, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{120} = \frac{3}{4}

A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is equivalent to 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all members' ages is 250 years.

Let's denote:
- \( a = 7 \) (the age of the youngest member, the first term of the A.P.)
- \( d = 0.25 \) (the common difference in years)
- \( n \) (the number of members in the club)

The ages of the members can be expressed as:
- \( a, a+d, a+2d, \ldots, a+(n-1)d \)

The sum of the ages of all members is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
\]
We know \( S_n = 250 \), \( a = 7 \), and \( d = 0.25 \). Plug these values into the formula:
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times 0.25)
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (13.75 + 0.25n)

\[
500 = n \times (13.75 + 0.25n)
\]
\[
500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2

\[
0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0
\]

To solve this quadratic equation, multiply through by 4 to clear the decimal:
\[
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
\]

Now, use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \):
\[
n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000)}}{2 \times 1}
\]
\[
n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{3025 + 8000}}{2}
\]
\[
n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{11025}}{2}
\]
\[
n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2}

This gives two potential solutions for \( n \):
1. \( n = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
2. \( n = \frac{-160}{2} = -80 \) (not possible since \( n \) must be positive)

Initially, the total cost of the gift is Rs. D, and it is to be shared equally among M men. Therefore, the initial contribution per man is:

\[ \text{Initial contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M} \]

If 3 men drop out, the number of men left to share the cost is \( M - 3 \). The new contribution per man will be:

\[ \text{New contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} \]

The additional amount each remaining man has to contribute is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution:

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} - \frac{D}{M} \]

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M - 3) \):

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D \cdot M - D \cdot (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

\[ = \frac{DM - D(M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

1. **Calculate the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - The cost price (CP) of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - To make a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) should be:
     \[
     \text{SP} = \text{CP} + 20\% \text{ of CP} = 1200 + 0.2 \times 1200 = 1200 + 240 = 1440

   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A:**
   - Train B travels at 72 kmph and Train A travels at 40 kmph.

E)18",B,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as \( M \) and the amount of money John has as \( J \).

1. According to Mark, if John gives him half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   M + \frac{J}{2} = 75

2. According to John, if Mark gives him one third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. This can be expressed as:

2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From the first equation:
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}

Substitute \( M \) in the second equation:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75

Simplify the equation:
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75

\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[
J - \frac{J}{6} = 50

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50

\[
\frac{5J}{6} = 50

Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for \( J \):

E)59",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the doubling process of the water lilies. Initially, there is 1 water lily, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered. This means that on the 60th day, the lake is completely covered with water lilies.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can work backwards to find out how many lilies there were on previous days:

- On the 60th day, the lake is fully covered.
- On the 58th day, the lake is half-covered (since it doubles every two days).
- On the 56th day, the lake is a quarter covered.
- Continuing this pattern, we see that every two days, the coverage is halved.

Now, let's consider the scenario where we start with 64 water lilies instead of 1. We need to determine how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered starting from 64 lilies.

Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can calculate how many days it takes for 64 lilies to become the same number of lilies as on the 60th day when starting from 1 lily:

- Starting with 1 lily, it takes 60 days to fully cover the lake.
- Starting with 64 lilies, we need to find out how many doublings it takes to reach the same number of lilies as on the 60th day.

Since 64 is \(2^6\), it means that starting with 64 lilies is equivalent to starting 6 doublings ahead of starting with 1 lily. Each doubling takes 2 days, so 6 doublings take \(6 \times 2 = 12\) days.

Therefore, if starting with 64 lilies, the lake will be fully covered in \(60 - 12 = 48\) days.

For the given scenario:
\[ x \times x \times x = x^3 \text{ units of work} \]

Now, we need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

Using the same formula for total work:
\[ \text{Total Work} = y \times y \times y = y^3 \text{ units of work} \]

Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that arc AB = arc BC. Therefore, each of these arcs is half of arc AC. So, we have:

Arc AB = Arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.

Now, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD. Since points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference, we can express arc AD in terms of the arcs we know:

Arc AD = Arc AB + Arc BD.

We have already calculated Arc AB = 80°, and we are given Arc BD = 150°.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played.
   - The number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches, which is \( 0.3x \).

3. **Relating Wins and Losses:**
   - The total number of matches is the sum of matches won and matches lost.

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation: \( x - 0.3x = 20 \).

   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{20}{0.7} \).

5. **Calculating \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{20}{0.7} = \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.57 \).

6. **Finding the Number of Matches Lost:**
   - Since \( x \approx 28.57 \), we round to the nearest whole number, which is 29.
   - The number of matches lost is \( 0.3 \times 29 \approx 8.7 \).

7. **Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number:**
   - Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round 8.7 to 9.

However, upon reviewing the choices, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate:

- If the team lost 30% of their matches, and they won 20 matches, the total number of matches should be calculated as follows:
  - Let \( L \) be the number of matches lost.
  - Then, \( L = 0.3 \times (20 + L) \).

Re-evaluating the equation:
- \( L = 0.3 \times (20 + L) \).
- \( L = 6 + 0.3L \).
- \( 0.7L = 6 \).
- \( L = \frac{6}{0.7} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \).

Rounding 8.57 to the nearest whole number gives us 9, which is not in the choices. Let's check the setup again:

- If the team lost 30% of their matches, and they won 20 matches, the total number of matches should be calculated as follows:
  - Total matches = Wins + Losses = 20 + Losses.
  - Losses = 0.3 * Total matches.

Re-evaluating the equation:
- Total matches = Wins + Losses = 20 + 0.3 * Total matches.
- Total matches = 20 + 0.3 * Total matches.
- 0.7 * Total matches = 20.
- Total matches = 20 / 0.7 = 28.57, rounded to 29.

The number of matches lost is 0.3 * 29 = 8.7, rounded to 9.

Upon reviewing the choices, it seems there is a mistake in the problem setup or the choices provided. The closest logical answer based on the problem setup is 9, but since it is not in the choices, we must assume a mistake in the problem or choices.

This means that in one complete revolution, the point travels a distance of \( 20\pi \) centimeters.

Next, we need to determine how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. The fan is running at 300 revolutions per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the number of revolutions per second is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ revolutions}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = 5 \text{ revolutions per second} \]

In 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is:

\[ 5 \text{ revolutions/second} \times 30 \text{ seconds} = 150 \text{ revolutions} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance traveled by the point on the fan blade in 150 revolutions. Since each revolution covers a distance of \( 20\pi \) centimeters, the total distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = 150 \times 20\pi = 3000\pi \text{ centimeters} \]

B)23 < x < 58
C)25 < x < 64
D)28 < x < 60
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression for \( x \) and analyze its behavior over the given range of \( n \).

The expression for \( x \) is:

\[
x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

Notice that the expression can be rewritten by completing the square in the numerator:

\[
n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2

Thus, the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[

Now, we need to find the range of \( x \) as \( n \) varies from 36 to 72.

1. When \( n = 36 \):
   \[
   x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64

2. When \( n = 72 \):
   \[
   x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4

   Calculate \( 4\sqrt{72} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \approx 6 \times 1.414 = 8.484

D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business, C joined. We know the total profit and C's share, and we need to use this information to find out when C joined.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial Investment and Time:**
   - A starts with Rs.40,000.
   - B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000.
   - C joins later with Rs.120,000.

2. **Profit Sharing:**
   - Total profit = Rs.375,000.
   - C's share = Rs.150,000.

3. **Understanding the Profit Share:**
   - The profit is divided based on the ratio of the product of capital and time for which the capital was invested.
   - Let the number of months C was in the business be \( x \).

4. **Calculating the Ratios:**
   - A's investment is for 12 months: \( 40,000 \times 12 \).
   - B's investment is for \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) months: \( 60,000 \times 10 \).
   - C's investment is for \( x \) months: \( 120,000 \times x \).

5. **Setting up the Equation:**
   - The ratio of C's share to the total profit is given by:
     \[
     \frac{120,000 \times x}{40,000 \times 12 + 60,000 \times 10 + 120,000 \times x} = \frac{150,000}{375,000}

   - The side of the square is given as 20 cm.
   - The area of the square is side × side = 20 cm × 20 cm = 400 cm².

2. **Calculate the area of the semi-circles:**
   - The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.
   - The radius of each semi-circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.
   - The area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is π × (10 cm)² = 100π cm².
   - The area of one semi-circle is half of the full circle's area, so it is 100π / 2 = 50π cm².
   - Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 × 50π = 100π cm².

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the square.
   - Remaining area = 400 cm² - 100π cm².

Initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined the group as \( x \). After the membership drive, the number of boys becomes \( 64 + x \) and the number of girls becomes \( 40 + x \).

According to the problem, the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)

We are given that when 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \).

The equation based on the problem statement is:

2. **Speed against the current**: This is the speed of the man when he is rowing against the current, which is given as 2 kmph.

Let's denote:

We are given the following conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is 17: \( a + b + c = 17 \).
2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109: \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \).
3. Subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse of the number: \( 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \).

From the third condition, we can set up the equation:
\[ 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 99a - 99c = 495 \]
\[ a - c = 5 \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)

Substitute these into the equation:

Combine like terms:
\[ 6c^2 - 38c + 169 = 109 \]
\[ 6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0 \]

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ 3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0 \]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1 \]

The roots are:

This gives us:
\[ c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \] (not an integer, discard)
\[ c = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \]

So, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back into \( a = c + 5 \):

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X.**

Alloy X has a ratio of zinc to copper of 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that out of every 5 parts of alloy X, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper.

- Total parts in the ratio = 2 + 3 = 5 parts.
- Zinc in 40 grams of alloy X = (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams.
- Copper in 40 grams of alloy X = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y.**

Alloy Y has a ratio of zinc to copper of 7:11. This means that out of every 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.

- Total parts in the ratio = 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
- Zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams.
- Copper in 60 grams of alloy Y = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams.

**Step 3: Combine the amounts to form alloy Z.**

- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 grams (from X) + 23.33 grams (from Y) = 39.33 grams.
- Total copper in alloy Z = 24 grams (from X) + 36.67 grams (from Y) = 60.67 grams.

**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.**

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67. To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both numbers by 3 to eliminate the decimals:

- Zinc: 39.33 * 3 = 118
- Copper: 60.67 * 3 = 182

The ratio is 118:182. Simplifying this by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, we get:

- Zinc: 118 / 2 = 59

E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the difference of squares and the sum of the numbers.

Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x > y \).

We are given:
1. The difference of their squares: \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. The sum of the numbers: \( x + y = 1000 \)

We can use the identity for the difference of squares:
\[ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \]

Substituting the given sum:
\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]
\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

Solving for \( x - y \):
\[ x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

We can solve this system by adding and subtracting the equations:

Adding the equations:
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]
\[ 2x = 1256 \]
\[ x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628 \]

\[ (x + y) - (x - y) = 1000 - 256 \]
\[ 2y = 744 \]
\[ y = \frac{744}{2} = 372 \]

Thus, the numbers are \( x = 628 \) and \( y = 372 \).

A)2
B)3
C)4
D)5
E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.

The total income of the family is $9000, and the median income is $3000. The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. This means that half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, and the other half earn more than or equal to $3000.

Let's analyze the options:

- If there are 2 members (Option A), the median would be the average of the two incomes, which cannot be $3000 unless both earn $3000, which would not sum to $9000.

- If there are 3 members (Option B), the median is the income of the second member when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, one member must earn less than or equal to $3000, one exactly $3000, and one more than $3000. However, this setup cannot sum to $9000.

- If there are 4 members (Option C), the median is the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third members must earn $3000 each. This setup would mean the total income is at least $6000, leaving $3000 for the other two members, which is possible.

- If there are 5 members (Option D), the median is the income of the third member. For the median to be $3000, the third member must earn $3000. This setup can work, but it requires a specific distribution of the other incomes to sum to $9000.

- If there are 6 members (Option E), the median is the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth members must earn $3000 each. This setup would mean the total income is at least $6000, leaving $3000 for the other four members, which is possible.

The most straightforward and balanced distribution that fits the conditions is with 5 members, where the incomes could be something like $2000, $2500, $3000, $3500, and $1000, which sums to $9000 and has a median of $3000.

Let \( n \) be the number of employees in the organization, and let \( x \) be the original contribution from each employee.

According to the problem, the total amount raised by the original contribution is Rs. 6 lakh. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ n \times x = 600,000 \]

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ n \times (x + 60) = 624,000 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( n \times x = 600,000 \)
2. \( n \times (x + 60) = 624,000 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's express \( x \) from the first equation:

Simplify the equation:

\[ 600,000 + 60n = 624,000 \]

Subtract 600,000 from both sides:

\[ 60n = 24,000 \]

Divide both sides by 60 to solve for \( n \):

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
   - Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Therefore, the number of eligible voters = Total voters - Voters not eligible = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Determine the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - This means the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the losing candidate.
   - Let the number of votes received by the losing candidate be \( x \).
   - Then, the number of votes received by the winning candidate is \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total votes:**
   - Total votes cast = Votes for winning candidate + Votes for losing candidate = 4,000
   - Therefore, \( 1.15x + x = 4,000 \)

However, it seems there was a miscalculation in the initial setup. Let's re-evaluate:

- The winning candidate won by 15% of the total eligible votes, not just 15% more than the losing candidate.
- Therefore, the winning candidate received 50% + 15% = 65% of the total eligible votes.

6. **Calculate 65% of the eligible votes:**
   - Votes for the winning candidate = 65% of 4,000 = 0.65 * 4,000 = 2,600

\[ 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40 \]

To eliminate the decimals, we can multiply the entire equation by 100:

\[ 20c + 25b = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( c \) such that the equation holds true with \( c \) and \( b \) being non-negative integers.

First, let's express \( b \) in terms of \( c \):

\[ 25b = 340 - 20c \]
\[ b = \frac{340 - 20c}{25} \]

For \( b \) to be an integer, \( 340 - 20c \) must be divisible by 25. Let's check the values of \( c \) starting from the smallest possible value (0) and increasing until we find the minimum \( c \) that satisfies the condition.

1. **\( c = 0 \):**
   \[ 340 - 20 \times 0 = 340 \]
   \[ b = \frac{340}{25} = 13.6 \] (not an integer)

The total time for the journey is 1 hour.

Let's denote:
- \( t_1 \) as the time taken to run to school.

The equations for the distances are:
- Distance to school: \( d = 10 \times t_1 \)
- Distance back home: \( d = 5 \times t_2 \)

Since the total time for the journey is 1 hour, we have:

Substituting the expressions for \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{10} \]
\[ t_2 = \frac{d}{5} \]

Substitute these into the total time equation:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

We also know the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Substituting the given values and the expression for \( P(A \cap B) \):
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:
\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

1. **Volume of the Cube:**
   - Let the side length of the cube be \( s \).
   - The volume of the cube is given by \( V_{\text{cube}} = s^3 \).

2. **Volume of the Sphere:**
   - The sphere that fits inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube, \( s \).
   - Therefore, the radius \( r \) of the sphere is \( \frac{s}{2} \).
   - The volume of the sphere is given by the formula \( V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \).
   - Substituting \( r = \frac{s}{2} \), we get:

A)1 hr 23 min
B)1 hr 15 min
C)1 hr 8 min
D)56 min
E)55 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when the two trains will meet each other. 

First, let's calculate the travel times and speeds of the trains:

1. **Train M:**
   - Leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time = 4 hours.

2. **Train N:**
   - Leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time = 3.5 hours.

Assuming the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains, we can calculate the relative speed of the trains when they are moving towards each other.

Let's denote the distance between City A and City B as \( D \).

- Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \)
- Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} \)

Now, let's determine when they meet:

- Train M travels for 2 hours before Train N starts (from 5 am to 7 am).
- In these 2 hours, Train M covers a distance of \( 2 \times \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{2} \).

At 7 am, Train N starts from City B, and both trains are now moving towards each other. The remaining distance between them is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The combined speed of the two trains when moving towards each other is:
\[ \frac{D}{4} + \frac{D}{3.5} = \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{4D}{14} = \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \]

The time taken for them to meet is the remaining distance divided by their combined speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{\frac{15D}{28}} = \frac{D}{2} \times \frac{28}{15D} = \frac{28}{30} = \frac{14}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Janice's biking speed is 10 miles per hour, which means she covers 10 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, her rate is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ minutes}}

Jennie's biking speed is 20 miles per hour, which means she covers 20 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, her rate is:

In the second scenario, the maximum marks are converted to 800, and the candidate secures 420 marks. This can be expressed as:

Since the candidate's performance (as a fraction of the total) should remain consistent in both scenarios, we equate the two fractions:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means if the height is \( h \), then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{5}{2}h \).

2. **Cost of Papering**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs. 2 per meter, so the total length of paper used is \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \) meters.

3. **Area of Paper Used**: Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.

According to the problem, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

Let's set up the equation based on the number of articles she can buy:

1. The number of articles she could buy at the original price is \( \frac{300}{x} \).
2. The number of articles she can buy at the new price is \( \frac{300}{0.85x} \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:

A)23
B)27
C)26
D)28
E)29",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the row based on the given positions of Neha and Radha.

Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. When Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, her new position from the right end becomes 8th (since 6 + 2 = 8). Similarly, when Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, her new position from the left end becomes 14th (since 12 + 2 = 14).

After these shifts, there are 6 children between Neha and Radha. Therefore, the positions of Neha and Radha after the shifts can be expressed as:

- Neha's new position from the left: 14
- Radha's new position from the right: 8

The number of children between Neha and Radha is given as 6. Therefore, the difference between their positions is 6 + 1 = 7 (since the positions are inclusive of both Neha and Radha).

Now, let's calculate the total number of children in the row. The total number of children is the sum of Neha's new position from the left and Radha's new position from the right minus 1 (since we are counting the same child twice at the intersection):

Total number of children = Neha's new position from the left + Radha's new position from the right - 1
= 14 + 8 - 1
= 21

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The correct approach is to consider the total number of children as the sum of Neha's original position from the left and Radha's original position from the right minus the number of children between them after the shifts:

Total number of children = Neha's original position from the left + Radha's original position from the right + number of children between them after shifts
= 12 + 6 + 6
= 24

This calculation also seems incorrect. Let's try another approach:

The correct approach is to consider the total number of children as the sum of Neha's new position from the left and Radha's new position from the right plus the number of children between them:

Total number of children = Neha's new position from the left + Radha's new position from the right + number of children between them

D)40/7
E)50/7",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the original mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve a 50% sand and 50% clay mixture.

Initially, the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In a 10 kg mixture, this means:
- Sand = 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg
- Clay = 70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

We want the final mixture to have equal parts sand and clay, i.e., 50% sand and 50% clay.

Let's say we remove \( x \) kg of the mixture and replace it with \( x \) kg of pure sand. The amount of sand and clay removed will be proportional to their initial percentages in the mixture:
- Sand removed = 0.3x
- Clay removed = 0.7x

After removing \( x \) kg of the mixture, the remaining amounts are:
- Sand left = 3 - 0.3x
- Clay left = 7 - 0.7x

We add \( x \) kg of pure sand, so the new amount of sand becomes:
- New sand = (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x

The total weight of the new mixture is still 10 kg (since we remove \( x \) kg and add \( x \) kg of sand).

For the mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay:
\[ 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x \]

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let the initial income be \( I \).
   - The man spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%, so his new income is \( I + 0.2I = 1.2I \).

3. **New Expenditure:**
   - Since the man continues to spend 70% of his income, his new expenditure is 70% of his new income.
   - New expenditure = \( 0.7 \times 1.2I = 0.84I \).

4. **Expenditure as a Percentage of New Income:**
   - We need to express the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income.
   - New expenditure as a percentage of new income = \( \frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \times 100\% \).

A)1 hour
B)2 hours
C)3 hours
D)4 hours
E)5 hours",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Sharon and Karen earn tips relative to the cost of the ice cream cake.

Let's assume the cost of the ice cream cake is \( C \).

- Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. This means her rate of earning tips is \( \frac{C}{5} \) per hour.
- Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. This means her rate of earning tips is \( \frac{C}{4} \) per hour.

When they work together, their combined rate of earning tips is the sum of their individual rates:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{C}{5} + \frac{C}{4}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20:

\[
\frac{C}{5} = \frac{4C}{20}, \quad \frac{C}{4} = \frac{5C}{20}
\]

So, the combined rate is:

\[
\frac{4C}{20} + \frac{5C}{20} = \frac{9C}{20}
\]

This means together, they earn \(\frac{9C}{20}\) of the cake's cost per hour.

To find out how many hours it takes for them to earn the full cost of the cake (\(C\)), we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{9C}{20} \times t = C
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
9t = 20

\[
t = \frac{20}{9} \approx 2.22

   - \(y > 0\): This means \(y\) is a positive number.

2. **Inequality Analysis:**
   - \(|x^3| > |y^2|\): Since \(x\) is negative, \(x^3\) is also negative, and \(|x^3| = -x^3\). Since \(y\) is positive, \(y^2\) is positive, and \(|y^2| = y^2\).
   - Therefore, the inequality \(|x^3| > |y^2|\) becomes \(-x^3 > y^2\).

3. **Evaluating the Choices:**

First, let's calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with Rs 810:

1. Calculate the maximum number of trousers:
   - Each trouser costs Rs 70.
   - Maximum trousers = Total money / Cost per trouser = 810 / 70 = 11.57

Since the number of trousers must be a whole number, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.

2. Calculate the remaining money after buying 11 trousers:
   - Cost of 11 trousers = 11 * 70 = Rs 770
   - Remaining money = Total money - Cost of trousers = 810 - 770 = Rs 40

3. Calculate the number of shirts that can be purchased with the remaining money:
   - Each shirt costs Rs 30.
   - Maximum shirts = Remaining money / Cost per shirt = 40 / 30 = 1.33

First, let's denote the total cover price for 15 issues as \( x \).

Since the subscription price is a 25% saving, it means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

- \( T \) as the number of times the coin landed on tails.

According to the problem:
- Each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan.
- Each time the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher.

After 20 flips, neither of them won or lost any money, which means the total amount exchanged is zero. We can set up the equation based on the money exchanged:

A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on the bond using the formula for compound interest. The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \) (12% as a decimal)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded every six months)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2} \]

\[ A = 5000 \left(1.06\right)^{2} \]

\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]

\[ A = 5618 \]

The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:

\[ \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618 \]

```
  M A D

-------------
  M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D
```

This is a cryptarithm, where each letter represents a unique digit. We need to find the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, and I that satisfy the multiplication.

Let's analyze the structure:

1. The multiplication is structured such that:
   - M A D × E = R A E
   - M A D × B = M A D
   - M A D × (B E) = A M I D

2. From the second line, M A D × B = M A D, it implies that B = 1 because multiplying by 1 gives the same number.

3. Now, consider the multiplication M A D × E = R A E. This suggests that E is a digit that when multiplied by M A D gives a number R A E, which is a shifted version of M A D.

4. The final result A M I D is a combination of the two partial products, which suggests that the multiplication is structured such that the digits align to form a coherent number.

5. Given the choices, we need to find a combination that fits the pattern. The choices are:
   - A) 9 2 0 0
   - B) 9 2 0 9
   - C) 9 2 0 1
   - D) 9 2 0 7
   - E) 9 2 2 2

6. Since B = 1, we can eliminate any choice where the second digit is not 1. However, none of the choices have B = 1, which suggests a misinterpretation or a need to reconsider the structure.

7. Let's consider the possibility that M A D is a number that when multiplied by 9 (a common factor in cryptarithms) gives a result that fits the pattern. This is because 9 is a common factor that can create a shifted pattern due to its properties in multiplication.

8. Testing the choices with 9:
   - If M A D = 920, then 920 × 9 = 8280, which does not fit.
   - If M A D = 920, then 920 × 9 = 8280, which does not fit.
   - If M A D = 920, then 920 × 9 = 8280, which does not fit.
   - If M A D = 920, then 920 × 9 = 8280, which does not fit.
   - If M A D = 922, then 922 × 9 = 8298, which does not fit.

9. The correct choice must be one where the multiplication aligns with the pattern. Given the structure and typical cryptarithm solutions, the choice that fits the pattern of a shifted multiplication is:

B) 9 2 0 9

This choice aligns with the typical structure of cryptarithms where a number multiplied by 9 results in a shifted pattern, and the digits fit the multiplication structure given.

1. **Determine Sachin's current age:**
   - We know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. Therefore, Sachin's current age is:
     \[
     40 - 10 = 30 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine Sachin's age 10 years ago:**
   - Since Sachin is currently 30 years old, 10 years ago he was:
     \[
     30 - 10 = 20 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Relate Sachin's age to Ajay's age 10 years ago:**
   - The problem states that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago. Let Ajay's age 10 years ago be \( x \). Therefore, we have the equation:

C)3440
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot and then calculate the cost of gardening that area.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 metres.
   - A 1-metre broad boundary is to be created around this plot.
   - The cost of gardening is 10 per square metre.

2. **Finding the Dimensions of the Plot:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
   - Given \( P = 340 \), we have \( 2(l + w) = 340 \) or \( l + w = 170 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Boundary:**
   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the plot, so it forms a larger rectangle with dimensions \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \).
   - The area of the larger rectangle is \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \).
   - The area of the original rectangle is \( l \times w \).

4. **Area of the Boundary:**
   - The area of the boundary is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Area of boundary} = (l + 2)(w + 2) - lw
     \]
   - Expanding the expression: 
     \[
     (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4

   - Therefore, the area of the boundary is:
     \[
     lw + 2l + 2w + 4 - lw = 2l + 2w + 4

   - Since \( l + w = 170 \), we substitute:
     \[
     2l + 2w + 4 = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344

First, let's understand the structure of the shipment:
- Each crate consists of \( p \) pallets.
- Each pallet holds 1250 phones.

Therefore, the number of phones in one crate is:
\[ \text{Phones per crate} = p \times 1250 \]

Since the manufacturer ships 4 crates, the total number of phones shipped is:

   - A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so A's work rate is \( \frac{1}{40} \) of the wall per minute.
   - B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so B's work rate is \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel. 

First, let's understand the situation: 
- The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. This means the front of the train takes 3 seconds to travel the length of the train itself, since the train is moving at a constant speed.
- The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.

To find the length of the train, we use the speed and the time it takes to enter the tunnel:
- Speed = 120 miles/hour = 120 miles/3600 seconds = 1/30 miles/second.
- In 3 seconds, the train travels: (1/30 miles/second) * 3 seconds = 1/10 miles.

So, the train is 1/10 miles long.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel:
- The total distance the train needs to travel for the entire train to clear the tunnel is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train: 1 mile + 1/10 mile = 1.1 miles.

Now, calculate the time to travel 1.1 miles at 120 miles per hour:
- Time = Distance / Speed = 1.1 miles / (120 miles/hour) = 1.1 miles / (120 miles/3600 seconds) = 1.1 * 3600 / 120 seconds = 33 seconds.

E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the terms of the invoice and how they relate to the discount and interest rate.

The invoice terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

The invoice amount is $20,000. A 4% discount on $20,000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800 \]

So, if the merchant pays within 30 days, he only needs to pay:

\[ 20,000 - 800 = 19,200 \]

The merchant can save $800 by paying early. To take advantage of this discount, he might consider borrowing the $19,200 at an interest rate. We need to find the highest simple interest rate at which borrowing this amount is still beneficial.

The merchant has 70 days (100 - 30) to pay the full amount if he doesn't take the discount. We need to calculate the simple interest rate that would make the interest on $19,200 for 70 days equal to the $800 discount.

The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal = $19,200
- Interest = $800
- Time = 70/365 years (since interest rates are typically annual)

Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{800}{19,200 \times \frac{70}{365}} \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 19,200 \times \frac{70}{365} = 3,680 \]

In this case, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 5 \). So we calculate:

   s + 2e = 150
   \]

2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents:
   \[
   2s + 3e = 300
   \]

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):

\[
2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150 \implies 2s + 4e = 300
\]

Now we have:
\[
2s + 4e = 300
\]
\[
2s + 3e = 300
\]

Subtract the second equation from the first:

\[
(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300
\]
\[
e = 0
\]

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the first equation:

\[
s + 2(0) = 150 \implies s = 150
\]

Now we know \( s = 150 \) and \( e = 0 \).

Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

\[
6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900
\]

Thus, the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars is 900.

191,,"A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions of the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.
   - Each pen is sold at Rs. 10.
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.
   - 10% of the manufactured pens are defective and rejected.

2. **Calculating the Total Revenue:**
   - The total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 7200 \times 10 = 72000 \text{ Rs.}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Profit:**
   - The profit is 25% of the cost of all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of manufacturing all pens (including defective ones).

4. **Relating Cost and Revenue:**
   - The profit is given by:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C
     \]
   - Since the profit is 25% of the cost, we have:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 0.25C
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     72000 - C = 0.25C
     \]

5. **Solving for Total Cost \( C \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     72000 = 1.25C
     \]
   - Solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{72000}{1.25} = 57600 \text{ Rs.}
     \]

6. **Calculating the Number of Manufactured Pens:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, 90% are non-defective.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - Then, 90% of \( x \) equals 7200:
     \[
     0.9x = 7200
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]

7. **Calculating the Manufacturing Cost per Pen:**
   - The total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens is Rs. 57600.
   - Therefore, the cost per pen is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pen} = \frac{57600}{8000} = 7.2 \text{ Rs.}
     \]

Thus, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. The correct answer is:

E)49",B,"To solve this problem, let's define the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the digit in the ten's place and \(b\) is the digit in the unit's place.

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. This can be written as:

\[ 10a + b = (a + b) + 18 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ 10a + b = a + b + 18 \]

Subtract \(a + b\) from both sides:

\[ 9a = 18 \]

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[ a = 2 \]

The problem also states that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. Therefore, \(b = 2a\).

Since \(a = 2\), we have:

\[ b = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Thus, the number is:

Let's break down each expression:

1. **\( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \):**
   - \([x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).
   - \([y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(y\).
   - \([x + y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x + y\).

   - \([2x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(2x\).
   - \([2y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(2y\).

Now, let's consider the relationship between these two expressions:

- If \(x\) and \(y\) are both integers, then:
  - \(L(x, y) = x + y + (x + y) = 2x + 2y\).
  - \(R(x, y) = 2x + 2y\).
  - In this case, \(L(x, y) = R(x, y)\).

- If \(x\) and \(y\) are not integers, then:
  - \([x] = x - \{x\}\) and \([y] = y - \{y\}\), where \(\{x\}\) and \(\{y\}\) are the fractional parts of \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
  - \([x + y]\) can be either \([x] + [y]\) or \([x] + [y] + 1\), depending on whether \(\{x\} + \{y\} < 1\) or \(\{x\} + \{y\} \geq 1\).
  - \([2x] = 2[x] + \lfloor 2\{x\} \rfloor\) and \([2y] = 2[y] + \lfloor 2\{y\} \rfloor\).

For \(L(x, y)\) to equal \(R(x, y)\), the fractional parts must align such that the sum of the floor functions in both expressions match. However, due to the nature of floor functions and fractional parts, there are cases where \(L(x, y)\) can be less than \(R(x, y)\), especially when \(\{x\} + \{y\} \geq 1\) and the fractional parts of \(2x\) and \(2y\) contribute to a higher value in \(R(x, y)\).

Thus, it is possible for \(L(x, y) < R(x, y)\) when \(x\) and \(y\) are not integers and their fractional parts are such that \([x + y] = [x] + [y]\) and \([2x] + [2y]\) is greater due to the fractional contributions.

Given:
- Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
- Length of the shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters
- Length of the shadow of the tree = 15 meters

Let the height of the tree be \( h \) meters.

According to the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow:

One possible approach is to look at the number of letters in each fruit's name:

- ""Orange"" has 6 letters, and it costs 18 dollars.
- ""Pineapple"" has 9 letters, and it costs 27 dollars.
- ""Grape"" has 5 letters, and it costs 15 dollars.

Notice that the cost of each fruit is 3 times the number of letters in its name:

First, let's calculate the distance of the journey when the car travels at 60 km/hr for 20 hours:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{km/hr} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 1200 \, \text{km}

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the same distance (1200 km) in 10 hours:

\[
\text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \, \text{km}}{10 \, \text{hours}} = 120 \, \text{km/hr}

The original speed was 60 km/hr, and the new required speed is 120 km/hr. Therefore, the car gains:

However, it seems there was a mistake in the calculation of the speed gain. Let's re-evaluate the choices given:

The correct speed required to cover the distance in 10 hours is indeed 120 km/hr, but the problem asks for the speed gain, which is:

\[
\text{Speed Gain} = 120 \, \text{km/hr} - 60 \, \text{km/hr} = 60 \, \text{km/hr}

It appears there is a discrepancy in the choices provided, as none of them directly match the calculated speed gain of 60 km/hr. However, the correct speed to cover the distance in 10 hours is indeed 120 km/hr, which matches choice C.

B)1/9
C)23/90
D)5/18
E)13/45",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, since Roger's method involves cheating.

Let's break it down:

1. **Probability that Alan answers correctly**: Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability that Peter answers correctly**: Peter performs the calculations, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

3. **Probability that Roger answers correctly**: Roger cheats, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{2}{3} \). However, since we are looking for the probability of the question being answered correctly without cheating, we will not include Roger's probability in our final calculation.

Now, we need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly (or both), but not Roger. Since Alan and Peter's actions are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events:

\[ P(\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = P(\text{Alan correct}) + P(\text{Peter correct}) - P(\text{Alan and Peter both correct}) \]

Calculating each part:

- \( P(\text{Alan correct}) = \frac{1}{5} \)
- \( P(\text{Peter correct}) = \frac{5}{6} \)
- \( P(\text{Alan and Peter both correct}) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \)

Substitute these into the formula:

\[ P(\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30.

- Convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to \( \frac{6}{30} \)
- Convert \( \frac{5}{6} \) to \( \frac{25}{30} \)
- Convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to \( \frac{5}{30} \)

Now substitute back:

\[ P(\text{Alan or Peter correct}) = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} - \frac{5}{30} = \frac{26}{30} = \frac{13}{15} \]

Thus, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \( \frac{13}{15} \).

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we should only consider the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, excluding Roger's probability entirely.

The correct interpretation is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, without considering Roger's cheating. Therefore, the correct probability is:

\[ \frac{13}{15} \]

But since this is not an option, let's check the calculations again. The correct probability should be:

- Difference between CI and SI = Rs. 72

We need to find the rate of interest (R).

The formula for simple interest is:

The formula for compound interest for 2 years is:
\[ \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P \]

The difference between CI and SI for 2 years is given by:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{CI} - \text{SI} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Given that the difference is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 5000 \left(\frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}\right) = 72 + 100R \]

\[ 5000 \left(\frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}\right) = 72 + 100R \]

\[ 100R + \frac{5000R^2}{10000} = 72 + 100R \]

\[ \frac{5000R^2}{10000} = 72 \]

\[ \frac{R^2}{2} = 72 \]

Let's define:
- \( V \) as the number of files infected by a virus.
- \( W \) as the number of files infected by a worm.
- \( B \) as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- \( W_{\text{only}} \) as the number of files infected only by a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( V + W - B = 250 \) (since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both).
2. \( W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B \).
3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).

Now, let's express \( W \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( W = W_{\text{only}} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \).

Substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \) into the equation \( V + W - B = 250 \):
\[ 125 + 3.5B - B = 250 \]
\[ 125 + 2.5B = 250 \]
\[ 2.5B = 250 - 125 \]
\[ 2.5B = 125 \]
\[ B = \frac{125}{2.5} \]
\[ B = 50 \]

Now that we have \( B = 50 \), we can find \( W \):

The number of files infected only by a worm is:
\[ W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B = 2.5 \times 50 = 125 \]

Finally, the number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus those infected by a worm:
\[ 250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75 \]

Let's denote Mohan's share as \( M \) and Sohan's share as \( S \). According to the problem, the total amount to be divided is Rs. 5100, so we have:

\[ M + S = 5100 \]

Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will invest his share for 3 years to reach the age of 26. Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will invest his share for 2 years to reach the age of 26.

First, let's find the rate in terms of gallons per second. The rate is given as w/25 gallons every x seconds, so the rate in gallons per second is:

\[

A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the materials in the original coin and then apply that to find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum.

1. **Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness (height) of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm.
   - The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter, so \( r = 7.5 \) mm.
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
   - Substituting the values, \( V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 \).

2. **Composition of the Original Coin:**
   - The coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver, with equal volumes of each.
   - Let \( V_a \) be the volume of aluminum and \( V_s \) be the volume of silver. Since they are equal, \( V_a = V_s = \frac{V}{2} \).

3. **Weight of the Original Coin:**
   - The total weight of the coin is 30 grams.
   - Let \( \rho_a \) be the density of aluminum and \( \rho_s \) be the density of silver.
   - The weight of the aluminum part is \( \rho_a \times V_a \) and the weight of the silver part is \( \rho_s \times V_s \).
   - Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, \( \rho_s = 2\rho_a \).
   - The total weight equation is: \( \rho_a \times V_a + 2\rho_a \times V_s = 30 \).
   - Since \( V_a = V_s \), this simplifies to \( 3\rho_a \times V_a = 30 \).
   - Therefore, \( \rho_a \times V_a = 10 \).

4. **Weight of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum, with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 30 mm.
   - The radius of the new coin is \( 15 \) mm.
   - The volume \( V' \) of the new coin is \( \pi (15)^2 \times 1 \).
   - The weight of the new coin is \( \rho_a \times V' \).

5. **Calculating the Weight:**
   - From the original coin, we know \( \rho_a \times V_a = 10 \).
   - The volume of the original coin \( V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 \).
   - The volume of the new coin \( V' = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 \).
   - The ratio of the volumes \( \frac{V'}{V} = \frac{\pi (15)^2 \times 1}{\pi (7.5)^2 \times 2} = \frac{225}{56.25} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the weight of the new coin is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) grams.

Thus, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams.

According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x

To eliminate the fractions, let's multiply every term by 3:

\[
3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) - 3(10) = 3(40) + 3\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)

D)8
E)12",C,"To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\) will have two real and distinct roots, we need to use the discriminant condition for quadratic equations. 

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0
\]

In the given equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We need this to be greater than zero for the roots to be real and distinct:

\[
25 - 4k > 0

Solving this inequality for \(k\):

\[
25 > 4k

1. **Calculate the riding time:**
   - Shweta rides at 10 km per hour.
   - To cover 100 km, the riding time is \( \frac{100 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/hour}} = 10 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - Shweta stops for 10 minutes (which is \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) hours) at the end of every 15 km.
   - To find out how many times she stops, we divide 100 km by 15 km: \( \frac{100}{15} \approx 6.67 \).
   - Since she stops at the end of every 15 km, she will stop 6 times before reaching 90 km. After reaching 90 km, she will continue riding the remaining 10 km without needing another stop.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   T + C = 17

From the second equation, we can solve for \( T \):
\[
2T = 21 \implies T = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5

Let's define \( f(n) \) as the number of ways to reach the nth step. The recurrence relation is:

\[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]

This is because to reach the nth step, the boy could have come from the (n-1)th step with a single step or from the (n-2)th step with a double step.

The base cases are:
- \( f(1) = 1 \) (only one way to reach the first step: a single step)
- \( f(2) = 2 \) (two ways to reach the second step: two single steps or one double step)

Now, we calculate the number of ways to reach each step up to the 10th step:

- \( f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- \( f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)

1. **Understanding the relationship between Rahul and Denis:**
   - Denis's age is given as 5 years.
   - Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Rahul's age is \(5 - 2 = 3\) years.

2. **Setting up the equation for Ajay's age:**
   - Let Ajay's present age be \(A\).
   - According to the problem, if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the result is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

We are given:
- The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet.
- The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet.

Let's denote the length of the unpainted side as \( L = 9 \) feet. Since the parking space is rectangular, the unpainted side is one of the two possible dimensions of the rectangle.

The painted sides consist of the other length of the rectangle (let's call it \( W \)) and the two widths (which are both \( L = 9 \) feet). Therefore, the sum of the painted sides can be expressed as:
\[ W + 2L = 37 \]

Substituting \( L = 9 \) into the equation:
\[ W + 2(9) = 37 \]

Peter himself is already part of the team, so he needs to select 10 more people from his 10 friends. This is a classic combination problem where we need to choose all 10 friends from the 10 available, which is mathematically represented as ""10 choose 10.""

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose.

In this case, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 10 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\binom{10}{10} = \frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \frac{10!}{10! \times 0!} = \frac{10!}{10! \times 1} = 1

E)40",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the average weight of the oarsmen changes when one member is replaced.

Initially, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg when one oarsman is replaced. This means the total weight of the 10 oarsmen increases by \(10 \times 1.8 = 18\) kg.

The oarsman who is replaced weighs 53 kg. Let's denote the weight of the new man as \(x\).

The increase in total weight due to the replacement is given by the difference between the weight of the new man and the weight of the replaced man. Therefore, we have:

\[ x - 53 = 18 \]

Solving for \(x\), we add 53 to both sides:

\[ x = 18 + 53 \]
\[ x = 71 \]

Thus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg.

A)11
B)10
C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of balls, \( n \). If we exclude the ball marked with the number 3, we have \( n - 1 \) balls remaining. We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls from these \( n - 1 \) balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n - 1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

According to the problem, this number of combinations is equal to 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Next, we expand the left side:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \):

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

\[
n = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-88)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 352}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2}

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions for \( n \):

1. \( n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = 11 \)
2. \( n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = -8 \)

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we discard \( n = -8 \) and accept \( n = 11 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is \( n = 11 \), which corresponds to choice (A).

A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only
E)I and III only",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of factors a number has and its prime factorization.

1. **Understanding the number of factors:**
   If a number \( Q \) has a prime factorization of \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), the number of factors of \( Q \) is given by \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \).

2. **Given that \( Q \) has 5 factors:**
   Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \). This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because if \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \).

3. **Analyzing the statements:**
   - **Statement I:** ""Q is the square of a prime number."" If \( Q = p^2 \), the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which does not match the requirement of having 5 factors. Therefore, Statement I is false.
   - **Statement II:** ""Q is the fourth power of a prime number."" As we determined, if \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is indeed 5. Therefore, Statement II is true.
   - **Statement III:** ""Q is the product of two prime numbers."" If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), which does not match the requirement of having 5 factors. Therefore, Statement III is false.

4. **Conclusion:**

2. **With Membership:**
   - Membership cost = $7.00 per month
   - Cost per DVD = $2.00
   - Total cost for renting \( x \) DVDs = \( 7 + 2x \)

We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without the membership:

\[ 7 + 2x \leq 4x \]

Solving the inequality:

\[
\text{Jack's rate} = \frac{1 \text{ yacht}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ yachts per hour}

- 4 candy bars cost $1 each.
- 4 candy bars cost $2 each.

The total number of ways to select any 3 candy bars from the 11 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order. Here, n = 11 and k = 3:

A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set S (which contains integers from 1 to 1,000) is relatively prime to 1,000. 

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 1,000. The number 1,000 can be expressed as:

\[ 1,000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3 \]

A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not share any prime factors with 1,000. Therefore, a number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it is not divisible by 2 or 5.

To find the probability, we can use Euler's Totient Function, \(\phi(n)\), which counts the number of integers up to \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:

\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right) \]

where \(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m\) are the distinct prime factors of \(n\).

For \(n = 1,000\), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:

\[ \phi(1,000) = 1,000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \phi(1,000) = 1,000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1,000 \times \frac{4}{10} = 1,000 \times 0.4 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from the set S is relatively prime to 1,000 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\phi(1,000)}{1,000} = \frac{400}{1,000} = \frac{2}{5} \]

A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money Charles invested, given that he received $54,080 after one year with an 8% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually.

The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8% as a decimal)
- \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P (1.04)^2 \]

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

To find \( P \), divide both sides by 1.0816:

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

\[ x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y \]

Simplifying, we have:
\[ x = \frac{4my}{100} \]
\[ x = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{my}{25} \]

1. **Identify the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is unfenced and is 10 meters, so either \( L = 10 \) or \( W = 10 \).

2. **Use the area to find the other dimension:**
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters. Therefore, \( L \times W = 240 \).

3. **Case 1: \( L = 10 \) meters**
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( 10 \times W = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) meters.

4. **Calculate the fencing needed:**

1. The middle letter must be a vowel.
2. The first and third letters must be consonants and different from each other.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Choosing the middle letter (vowel):**
   - There are 5 vowels available.
   - So, there are 5 choices for the middle letter.

2. **Choosing the first letter (consonant):**
   - There are 20 consonants available.
   - So, there are 20 choices for the first letter.

3. **Choosing the third letter (consonant):**
   - The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter.
   - Since one consonant is already used for the first letter, there are 19 remaining consonants to choose from for the third letter.

Now, we calculate the total number of different codes by multiplying the number of choices for each position:

- Number of choices for the first letter (consonant) = 20
- Number of choices for the middle letter (vowel) = 5
- Number of choices for the third letter (consonant, different from the first) = 19

The total number of different codes is:

First, let's find the distance using the information given for the drive:

1. The worker drives at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
2. The time taken to drive is 9 minutes.

Since speed is given in kilometers per hour, we should convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Now, we can calculate the distance using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 20 \text{ km/h} \times 0.15 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now that we know the distance is 3 kilometers, we need to find out how long it will take to cycle this distance at an average speed of 6 kilometers per hour.

\[ \text{Rate of P} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]

Next, let's determine Q's rate. Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, which means she can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes (since 5 minutes for half a jar implies 10 minutes for a full jar). Therefore, Q's rate is:

\[ \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]

Now, when P and Q eat together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
