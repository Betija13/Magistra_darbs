0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( d_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base is \( d_2 \).

1. **At 45°:**
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \implies h = d_1
   \]

2. **At 60°:**
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies h = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

Since \( h = d_1 \) and \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
   \[
   d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

3. **Distance traveled in 10 minutes:**
   \[
   d_1 - d_2 = d_2 \sqrt{3} - d_2 = d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)
   \]

4. **Time to reach the base:**
   The car travels the distance \( d_2 \) in the remaining time. The speed of the car is constant, so the time taken to travel \( d_2 \) is proportional to the distance:
   \[
   \text{Time to reach the base} = \frac{d_2}{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)} \times 10 = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the time expression:**
   Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
   \]

Thus, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

The correct answer is (A).

21,,"Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"```
Let's assume Alex makes x toys and Jacob makes y toys. We know that:

1. x + y = 35 (total toys made by both)
2. 7x ≈ 9y (since they worked for almost similar number of hours)

From equation 1, we have y = 35 - x.

Substitute y in equation 2:

7x ≈ 9(35 - x)
7x ≈ 315 - 9x
7x + 9x ≈ 315
16x ≈ 315
x ≈ 315/16
x ≈ 19.6875

Since x must be an integer, let's check the closest integer values for x:

If x = 20, then y = 35 - 20 = 15
If x = 19, then y = 35 - 19 = 16

Now, let's check the hours worked for these values:

For x = 20, y = 15:
Hours worked by Alex = 7 * 20 = 140
Hours worked by Jacob = 9 * 15 = 135

For x = 19, y = 16:
Hours worked by Alex = 7 * 19 = 133
Hours worked by Jacob = 9 * 16 = 144

The hours worked are closer when x = 20 and y = 15, but since the problem states they worked for almost similar number of hours, the difference in hours is acceptable for x = 19 and y = 16 as well.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is 16.

The answer is B)16.

25,,"A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
A)$27.30
B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"C)$63.00
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the given information.

1. Let the cost of the appliance be \( C \).
2. The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price is \( C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).
3. The gross profit is given as $20.00, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   1.4C - C = 0.4C = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( C \), we get:
   \[
   0.4C = 20 \implies C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
   \]
5. The selling price is \( 1.4C = 1.4 \times 50 = 70 \).

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"A)384
------
A)384
------
To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Let's assume the side of the square is \( s \).

1. **Total Distance**: The plane flies around a square, so the total distance is \( 4s \).

2. **Time Taken**:
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{200} \)
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{400} \)
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{600} \)
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{800} \)

   Total time \( T \) is the sum of these times:
   \[
   T = \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800}
   \]

   To simplify, find a common denominator, which is 2400:
   \[
   T = \frac{12s}{2400} + \frac{6s}{2400} + \frac{4s}{2400} + \frac{3s}{2400}
   \]
   \[
   T = \frac{12s + 6s + 4s + 3s}{2400} = \frac{25s}{2400} = \frac{s}{96}
   \]

3. **Average Speed**:
   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4s}{\frac{s}{96}} = 4s \times \frac{96}{s} = 384 \text{ km/hr}
   \]

Thus, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

41,,"Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \) hours to fill the pool alone.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)8
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

First, let's find the rate of hose A. Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

Hose A works alone for 2 hours, so it fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool in that time.

This means \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled by both hoses working together.

The two hoses together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool per 3 hours, or \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

We know the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour. Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour.

The combined rate of hoses A and B is:
\[
\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Solving for \( \frac{1}{b} \):
\[
\frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Thus, \( b = 8 \).

Therefore, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

The correct answer is:
A)8
------
B)15
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

First, let's define the rates:
- Let the rate of hose A be \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, since it can fill the pool in 8 hours.
- Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour, where \( b \) is the number of hours it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone.

Hose A works alone for the first 2 hours, filling \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

This means \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled by both hoses working together in the next 3 hours.

The combined rate of hoses A and B is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} \]

In 3 hours, they fill \( 3 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool.

Setting up the equation:
\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from both sides:
\[ \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \]

Find a common denominator and subtract:
\[ \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Thus, \( b = 8 \).

Therefore, hose B, working alone, would take 8 hours to fill the entire pool.

------
D)Rs. 3937.50
------
(C)Rs. 4000
------
A)Rs. 4400
------
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The man spends Rs. 3500 per month.
   - He saves 12.5% of his income.

2. **Expressing Savings in Terms of Income:**
   - If he saves 12.5% of his income, it means he spends 87.5% of his income (since 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let his monthly income be Rs. X.
   - According to the problem, 87.5% of his income is equal to his spending, which is Rs. 3500.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.875 * X = 3500.

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To find X, divide both sides of the equation by 0.875:
     X = 3500 / 0.875

5. **Calculating the Income:**
   - X = 4000

6. **Conclusion:**
   - His monthly income is Rs. 4000.

Now, let's match this with the given choices:

A) Rs. 4400
B) Rs. 4270
C) Rs. 4000
D) Rs. 3937.50
E) None of these
