The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the base of a tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Visualize the Situation:**
   - Draw a right triangle where the height of the tower is the opposite side, and the distance from the car to the base of the tower is the adjacent side.
   - At the initial position, the angle of elevation is 45°, and at the final position, it is 60°.

3. **Use Trigonometry:**
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the tower, and \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) be the distances from the car to the base of the tower when the angles are 45° and 60°, respectively.
   - For the angle of 45°: \(\tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} \Rightarrow x_1 = h\).
   - For the angle of 60°: \(\tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} \Rightarrow x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}\).

4. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:**
   - The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance traveled in 10 minutes is \( x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}})\).

5. **Determine the Speed of the Car:**
   - The speed of the car is the distance traveled divided by time: \( v = \frac{h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10} \).

6. **Calculate the Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

7. **Calculate the Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The time to reach the base is the remaining distance divided by the speed: 
   \[
   t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
   \]

8. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it:
   \[
   t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
   \]

Therefore, the car will take an additional \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes to reach the base of the tower. The correct answer is **A) 5(√3 + 1)**.",True,,,,,
1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the original price of the item. Let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the Coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price after the coupon is:
   \[
   \text{Price after Coupon} = 0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Relate to Half the Original Price:**
   According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8
   \]
   Divide by 0.56 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} \approx 78.2143
   \]

5. **Choose the Closest Answer:**
   The closest answer choice to 78.2143 is \( \boxed{78.20} \).

2,,"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?
A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given choices is a multiple of \( X \), where \( X \) is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. 

### Step 1: Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM)

First, we need to find the least common multiple of 9 and 12, as this will give us the smallest number that is divisible by both.

- **Prime factorization**:
  - 9 = \( 3^2 \)
  - 12 = \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \)

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - Take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
  - LCM = \( 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36 \)

Thus, the smallest number \( X \) that is divisible by both 9 and 12 is 36.

### Step 2: Check the Choices

Now, we need to check which of the given choices is a multiple of 36.

- **A) 36**: 36 is a multiple of 36 (since 36 divided by 36 equals 1).
- **B) 15**: 15 is not a multiple of 36 (since 15 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **C) 17**: 17 is not a multiple of 36 (since 17 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **D) 5**: 5 is not a multiple of 36 (since 5 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **E) 7**: 7 is not a multiple of 36 (since 7 divided by 36 is not an integer).

### Conclusion

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. This involves understanding the concept of complementary probabilities and the potential overlap between the two events.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Stock A increases: \( P(A) = 0.56 \)
   - Probability that Stock B increases: \( P(B) = 0.74 \)

2. **Complementary Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Stock A does not increase: \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \)
   - Probability that Stock B does not increase: \( P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \)

3. **Calculate the Probability that Neither Increases:**
   - We want to find \( P(A' \cap B') \), the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases.
   - Using the formula for the probability of the intersection of two independent events: 
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \times P(B') = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
     \]
   - However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, which implies considering the possibility that the events are not independent.

4. **Consider the Overlap:**
   - The greatest probability that neither event occurs would be if the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time.
   - In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is simply the sum of their individual probabilities of not occurring:
     \[
     P(A' \cup B') = P(A') + P(B') = 0.44 + 0.26 = 0.70
     \]
   - However, this is not possible since the sum of probabilities cannot exceed 1. Therefore, we need to consider the overlap.

5. **Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   - The probability that neither event occurs is given by:
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = 1 - P(A \cup B)
     \]
   - Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
     \[
     P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
     \]
   - The minimum value of \( P(A \cap B) \) is 0 (if they are mutually exclusive), which gives the maximum value for \( P(A' \cap B') \).

6. **Calculate the Maximum Probability:**
   - If \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \), then:
     \[
     P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.56 + 0.74 = 1.30
     \]
   - Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, the maximum possible value for \( P(A \cup B) \) is 1.
   - Therefore, the greatest value for \( P(A' \cap B') \) is:
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - 1 = 0
     \]

7. **Re-evaluate the Problem:**
   - The greatest realistic value for \( P(A' \cap B') \) considering overlap is:
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B))
     \]
   - If \( P(A \cap B) \) is maximized, then:
     \[
     P(A \cap B) = \min(P(A), P(B)) = 0.56
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(A \cup B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26
     \]

The greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is \( \boxed{0.26} \).",False,,,,,

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit
   - Profit is 20% of the Cost Price.

2. **Express the Profit in Terms of Cost Price:**
   - Profit = 20% of CP = 0.20 * CP

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - SP = CP + Profit
   - 360 = CP + 0.20 * CP

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - 360 = 1.20 * CP

5. **Solve for CP:**
   - CP = 360 / 1.20
   - CP = 300

### Verification:

- If the cost price is Rs. 300, then the profit would be 20% of 300, which is Rs. 60.
- Therefore, the selling price would be 300 + 60 = Rs. 360, which matches the given selling price.

### Conclusion:

The cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

### Answer:

B) 300

### Alternative Methods:

- **Estimation:**
  - Since the selling price is Rs. 360 and the profit is 20%, we can estimate that the cost price should be somewhat less than Rs. 360. By calculating 20% of Rs. 300, we find it matches the profit needed to reach Rs. 360.

- **Visual Aid:**
  - Draw a simple bar diagram where the total length represents the selling price (Rs. 360), and divide it into parts representing the cost price and the profit. This can help visualize the relationship between these values.

- **Discussion:**
  - Discussing with others might bring up alternative ways to think about the percentage increase or different methods to solve similar problems, such as using ratios or proportions.

By breaking down the problem and using these methods, we can confidently determine that the cost price is Rs. 300.",False,,,,,

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - 20 marbles are painted black and returned to the bag.
   - When 20 marbles are pulled out again, 1 of them is black.

2. **Understanding the Percentage:**
   - The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is \( \frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\% \).
   - This percentage is representative of the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of black marbles in the bag. Since 20 marbles were painted black, \( B = 20 \).
   - The percentage of black marbles in the bag is \( \frac{B}{Q} \times 100\% = 5\% \).

4. **Solving for \( Q \):**
   - Substitute \( B = 20 \) into the percentage equation:

C)74325
D)65000
E)97656",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using a specific format: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Letters**: 
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A to Z).
   - We need to choose 2 letters. The problem does not specify that the letters need to be distinct, so we will assume they can be the same.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 letters (where repetition is allowed) is \(26 \times 26 = 676\).

2. **Numbers**:
   - There are 10 digits (0 to 9).
   - We need to choose 2 numbers. Again, the problem does not specify that the numbers need to be distinct, so we will assume they can be the same.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 numbers (where repetition is allowed) is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

3. **Total Combinations**:
   - Since the letters and numbers are independent of each other, we multiply the number of combinations for letters by the number of combinations for numbers.
   - Total combinations = \(676 \times 100 = 67,600\).

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem: ""How many letters need to be distinct?"" Since the problem does not explicitly require the letters to be distinct, we assumed they could be the same in our calculation. If the letters were required to be distinct, the calculation would be different:

- **Distinct Letters**:
  - The number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters is \(26 \times 25 = 650\) (since the first letter can be any of the 26, and the second must be different, so 25 choices remain).

- **Total Combinations with Distinct Letters**:
  - Total combinations = \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\).

Given the choices provided, the closest match to our calculation with distinct letters is option D) 65,000. Therefore, if the letters need to be distinct, the answer is 65,000. If they do not need to be distinct, the answer would be 67,600, which is not listed as an option. Thus, the problem likely assumes distinct letters, leading us to choose option D) 65,000.",False,,,,,

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination.
   - Therefore, the total distance is \(100 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 1000 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining.
   - A quarter of the total distance is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance:**
   - The train travels the first 250 miles at 100 miles/hour.
   - Time taken for this segment is \(\frac{250 \text{ miles}}{100 \text{ miles/hour}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - After covering 250 miles, the remaining distance is \(1000 \text{ miles} - 250 \text{ miles} = 750 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - The train travels the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour.

C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who did not attend either the prom night or the debating session. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to help us with this calculation.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total number of students**: 200

2. **Students who attended the prom night**: At least 45% of 200 students attended the prom night.
   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]
   So, at least 90 students attended the prom night.

3. **Students who took part in the debating session**: At least 35% of 200 students took part in the debating session.
   \[
   0.35 \times 200 = 70

   So, at least 70 students took part in the debating session.

4. **Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion**:
   - Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night.
   - Let \( D \) be the set of students who took part in the debating session.
   - We want to find the maximum number of students who are in neither \( P \) nor \( D \), i.e., \( |P \cup D|^c \).

   According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
   \[
   |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D|
   \]

   We want to maximize the number of students who are in neither, which is:
   \[
   200 - |P \cup D|
   \]

   To maximize the number of students who are in neither, we need to minimize \( |P \cup D| \). This happens when the overlap \( |P \cap D| \) is maximized. The maximum overlap occurs when all students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night, or vice versa.

   Since at least 90 students attended the prom night and at least 70 students took part in the debating session, the maximum overlap \( |P \cap D| \) is 70 (since 70 is the smaller number).

5. **Calculate the minimum \( |P \cup D| \)**:
   \[
   |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
   \]

6. **Calculate the maximum number of students who attended neither**:
   \[
   200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 90 = 110

A)15
B)24
C)25
D)40
E)52",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sales of $250 each are required for the salesperson to earn at least $1000 in commission.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understand the Commission Structure:**
   - The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale.
   - For a sale of $250, the commission is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Commission per sale} = 10\% \times 250 = 0.10 \times 250 = 25
     \]

2. **Determine the Total Commission Needed:**
   - The salesperson wants to earn at least $1000 in commission.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sales needed.
   - The total commission from \( x \) sales is \( 25x \).
   - We need this total commission to be at least $1000:
     \[
     25x \geq 1000
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the inequality by 25 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x \geq \frac{1000}{25} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The salesperson must make at least 40 sales to earn a commission of at least $1000.

### Verification and Estimation:

- **Estimation Technique:**
  - If each sale gives $25, then to estimate how many sales are needed for $1000, think of it as:
    \[
    \frac{1000}{25} = 40
    \]
  - This confirms our calculation.

- **Visual Aid:**
  - A simple bar graph could be drawn where each bar represents $25, and you count how many bars are needed to reach $1000. This would visually show that 40 bars (sales) are needed.

- **Discussion with Others:**
  - Discussing with peers might bring up alternative methods, such as using a table to list cumulative commissions for each sale until reaching $1000, which would also show that 40 sales are needed.

B)4,200
C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define some variables and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Calculate Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate Non-Defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is the total staplers minus the defective ones: \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

4. **Calculate Mistakenly Rejected Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of mistakenly rejected staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we set up the equation:
     \[
     0.018x = 72
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.018 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{72}{0.018} = 4000
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If 4000 staplers were produced, then:
     - Defective staplers: \( 0.10 \times 4000 = 400 \)
     - Non-defective staplers: \( 4000 - 400 = 3600 \)
     - Mistakenly rejected non-defective staplers: \( 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \), which matches the given condition.

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Rate of Production

- **Machine A** produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- **Machine B** produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

### Step 2: Calculate the Combined Rate of Production

To find the combined rate of production, we add the rates of both machines:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18.

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
\]

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

This means together, the machines produce \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

### Step 3: Determine the Time to Produce 10 Yo-yos

To find out how long it takes to produce 10 yo-yos, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{10 \times 18}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Thus, it will take 36 minutes for both machines to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

The correct answer is:

E)9!",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to rearrange the letters of the word ""PROBLEC"" to form 7-letter words where no letters repeat.

The word ""PROBLEC"" consists of 7 unique letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, and C. Since we are forming 7-letter words using all 7 letters, we are essentially looking for the number of permutations of these 7 distinct letters.

The formula for the number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects is \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

In this case, \( n = 7 \), so the number of permutations is:

\[ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \]

A)0.2
B)0.4
C)0.6
D)1.2
E)1.5",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability. The notation \( P(A/B) \) represents the probability of event \( A \) occurring given that event \( B \) has occurred. For independent events, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.

Given that \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) is simply the probability of \( A \). This is because the occurrence of \( B \) does not change the likelihood of \( A \) occurring. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ P(A/B) = P(A) \]

Since \( P(A) = 0.2 \), we have:

\[ P(A/B) = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 0.2

To further understand this, let's break it down:

1. **Independence of Events**: When two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. This is a key concept in probability theory.

2. **Conditional Probability Formula**: Generally, the conditional probability \( P(A/B) \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
   \]
   However, for independent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \). Substituting this into the formula gives:
   \[
   P(A/B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)
   \]

3. **Visual Aid**: Imagine a Venn diagram where two circles represent events \( A \) and \( B \). Since they are independent, the overlap (intersection) is simply the product of their probabilities, and the occurrence of \( B \) does not change the size of \( A \).

4. **Estimation Technique**: If you were to estimate without calculation, knowing that \( A \) and \( B \) are independent should lead you to conclude that the probability of \( A \) remains unchanged by the occurrence of \( B \).

By discussing this with others, you might gain insights into different ways to visualize or conceptualize independence and conditional probability, reinforcing the understanding that for independent events, \( P(A/B) = P(A) \).",True,,,,,

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( v \) be the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- Let \( S \) be the total number of steps in the staircase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Scenarios
1. **First Scenario:**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - It takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
   - During these 10 minutes, the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 20 \) steps.

   Therefore, the equation for this scenario is:
   \[
   S - 20 = 10v

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - You walk 10 steps and then stop.
   - It takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom.
   - During these 20 minutes, the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 10 \) steps.

   Therefore, the equation for this scenario is:
   \[

### Step 3: Solve the Equations
We have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v

\[
v = 1

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Let's verify by substituting \( v = 1 \) back into the equations:

- For the first scenario: \( S - 20 = 10 \times 1 \Rightarrow S = 30 \)
- For the second scenario: \( S - 10 = 20 \times 1 \Rightarrow S = 30 \)

Both scenarios give the same total number of steps, confirming our solution.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Profit Calculation:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.
   - Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Bag:**
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25.

3. **Determine the Number of Bags Sold:**
   - The total profit made is $3,000.
   - If the profit per bag is $25, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
   - Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags.

Upon reviewing the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the profit percentage. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the cost price is 75% of the selling price.
- If the selling price is $100, the cost price is 75% of $100 = $75.
- The profit per bag is $100 - $75 = $25, which matches our previous calculation.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all three.
   - Prime factorization:
     - \(16 = 2^4\)
     - \(10 = 2 \times 5\)

E)2.85 miles",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, given that his speed is reduced by 4 mph from his usual speed of 15 mph.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Determine Bill's Speed on a Windy Day:**
   - Bill's usual speed = 15 mph
   - Speed reduction on a windy day = 4 mph
   - Speed on a windy day = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

2. **Convert Time from Minutes to Hours:**
   - Time given = 21 minutes
   - Since speed is in miles per hour, convert minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{21 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.35 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:**
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\)
   - Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

4. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   - The calculated distance is already at the hundredth place: 3.85 miles

5. **Select the Correct Choice:**
   - The answer is 3.85 miles, which corresponds to choice D.

### Visual Aid:
- **Graphical Representation:**
  - You could draw a simple line graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis to visualize how far Bill travels over time at 11 mph. This can help confirm the calculation visually.

### Estimation Technique:
- **Quick Estimation:**
  - If Bill travels 11 miles in 1 hour, in about 1/3 of an hour (20 minutes), he would travel approximately 1/3 of 11 miles, which is around 3.67 miles. Since 21 minutes is slightly more than 20 minutes, the distance should be slightly more than 3.67 miles, which aligns with 3.85 miles.

### Discussion:
- Discussing with others might bring up alternative methods, such as using a proportion to solve the problem:
  \[
  \frac{11 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{21 \text{ minutes}}
  \]
  Solving for \(x\) gives the same result: \(x = 3.85\) miles.

A)$27.30
B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Cost, Selling Price, and Profit:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the appliance.
   - The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above the cost price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C
     \]
   - The gross profit is given as $20.00, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
     \[
     S - C = 20
     \]

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - From the expression for the selling price, we have:
     \[
     1.4C - C = 20
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation gives:
     \[
     0.4C = 20
     \]

3. **Solve for the Cost Price \( C \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the Selling Price \( S \):**
   - Substitute \( C = 50 \) back into the expression for the selling price:
     \[
     S = 1.4 \times 50 = 70
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - The selling price is $70.00, which is 40% above the cost price of $50.00. The profit is indeed $20.00, confirming our calculations.

6. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The selling price of the appliance is $70.00, which corresponds to choice D.

E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest on the borrowed amount.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Understand Simple Interest Formula:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount borrowed),
   - \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
   - \( T \) is the time in years.

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Principal (\( P \)) = Rs. 500
   - Rate of Interest (\( R \)) = 6% per annum
   - Time (\( T \)) = 4 years

3. **Calculate the Simple Interest:**
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} = \frac{12000}{100} = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Paid:**
   The total amount Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal and the simple interest.
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{SI} = 500 + 120 = 620
   \]

### Conclusion:
Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years.

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the distance traveled by the jeep.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (in kilometers).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Therefore, \( d = v \times 6 \).

3. **Return Journey:**
   - The speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed during the return journey is \( v + 12 \) km/hr.
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Therefore, \( d = (v + 12) \times 4 \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since the distance \( d \) is the same for both journeys, we can set the two expressions for \( d \) equal to each other:
     \[
     6v = 4(v + 12)
     \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**
   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     6v = 4v + 48
     \]
   - Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:
     \[
     2v = 48
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     v = 24

1. **Understand the Scale**: The map scale indicates that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in reality. This means that for every 1/4 inch on the map, the actual distance is 10 miles.

2. **Convert the Map Measurement to Actual Distance**:
   - First, determine how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches. Since 1 inch is equivalent to 4 quarters (1/4 inches), we can calculate the number of 1/4 inches in 20 inches:
     \[
     20 \text{ inches} \times 4 = 80 \text{ (1/4 inches)}
     \]
   - Now, use the scale to convert the map measurement to actual distance. Since each 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, multiply the number of 1/4 inches by 10 miles:
     \[
     80 \times 10 = 800 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculation by considering the conversion factor:
   - If 1/4 inch = 10 miles, then 1 inch = 4 \times 10 = 40 miles.
   - Therefore, 20 inches = 20 \times 40 = 800 miles.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along the length:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each half will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 48 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the width:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each half will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

**Step 1: Solve for one variable.**

From Equation 1:
\[ l = 48 - 2w \]

Substitute \( l = 48 - 2w \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2w) + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4w + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3w = 66 \]
\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

**Step 2: Substitute back to find \( l \).**

Substitute \( w = 10 \) into \( l = 48 - 2w \):
\[ l = 48 - 2(10) \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the area of the sheet.**

E)None",A,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define the variable:**
   Let \( x \) be the number we are trying to find.

2. **Set up the expressions:**
   - The correct calculation should have been \( \frac{7}{8} \times x \).
   - The incorrect calculation was \( \frac{7}{18} \times x \).

3. **Understand the difference:**
   The difference between the correct and incorrect calculations is given as 770. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   Factor out \( x \) from the left side:
   \[
   x \left(\frac{7}{8} - \frac{7}{18}\right) = 770
   \]

5. **Find a common denominator:**
   The common denominator of 8 and 18 is 72. Convert the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{7}{8} = \frac{63}{72}, \quad \frac{7}{18} = \frac{28}{72}

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{35}{72}\):
   \[
   x = 770 \times \frac{72}{35}

E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use a step-by-step approach.

1. **Understand the Salary Structure:**
   - The shop assistant has a fixed salary of $500.
   - In addition to the fixed salary, she earns 5% of her monthly sales.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the monthly sales.
   - The total salary \( S \) is given by the equation:
     \[
     S = 500 + 0.05x

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average speed of the airplane as it flies around the square. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - The airplane flies along the four sides of a square.
   - The speeds for each side are 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.

2. **Assume a Side Length:**
   - Let's assume the side length of the square is \( L \). The total distance traveled around the square is \( 4L \).

3. **Calculate Time for Each Side:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr: \( t_1 = \frac{L}{200} \)
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr: \( t_2 = \frac{L}{400} \)
   - Time taken to travel the third side at 600 km/hr: \( t_3 = \frac{L}{600} \)
   - Time taken to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr: \( t_4 = \frac{L}{800} \)

4. **Total Time Taken:**
   \[
   T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = \frac{L}{200} + \frac{L}{400} + \frac{L}{600} + \frac{L}{800}

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white sharpeners.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of sharpeners is 18:
     \[
     w + b = 18
     \]
   - We also know that each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.
   - The total cost of the sharpeners is 100 rupees:
     \[
     w(x + 1) + bx = 100
     \]

3. **Simplify the Second Equation:**
   - Expand the second equation:
     \[
     wx + w + bx = 100
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (w + b)x + w = 100
     \]
   - Substitute the first equation \( w + b = 18 \) into the second equation:
     \[
     18x + w = 100
     \]
   - Rearrange to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 100 - 18x
     \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     100 - 18x + b = 18
     \]
   - Simplify to find \( b \):
     \[
     b = 18x - 82
     \]

5. **Check Integer Solutions:**
   - Since \( w \) and \( b \) must be non-negative integers, we need \( 100 - 18x \geq 0 \) and \( 18x - 82 \geq 0 \).
   - Solving \( 100 - 18x \geq 0 \):
     \[
     x \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56
     \]
   - Solving \( 18x - 82 \geq 0 \):
     \[
     x \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56
     \]
   - Therefore, \( x \) must be an integer between 5 and 5 (inclusive).

6. **Calculate \( w \) and \( b \):**
   - If \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     w = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 10
     \]
     \[
     b = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 8

C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Understand the rates of hoses:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the work done by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Find the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Together, their rate is \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \).

6. **Solve for \( b \):**
   - \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - Subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from both sides: \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \)
   - Find a common denominator: \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8} \)
   - \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)

B)40%
C)20%
D)10%
E)5%",C,"To solve the problem of finding the reduction percent when 120 is reduced to 96, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the Amount of Reduction:**
   - Subtract the final value (96) from the initial value (120) to find the amount of reduction.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 120 - 96 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the Reduction Percent:**
   - The reduction percent is calculated by dividing the amount of reduction by the original amount and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.
   \[
   \text{Reduction Percent} = \left(\frac{\text{Reduction}}{\text{Original Amount}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Reduction Percent} = \left(\frac{24}{120}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   - Simplify \(\frac{24}{120}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 24.
   \[
   \frac{24}{120} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

4. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - Multiply the simplified fraction by 100 to get the percentage.
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

Therefore, the reduction percent is 20%. The correct choice is:

C) 20%

**Alternative Methods:**

- **Estimation Technique:**
  - Recognize that 96 is 80% of 120 (since 96/120 = 0.8), which means there is a 20% reduction from 100% to 80%.

- **Visual Aid:**
  - Draw a bar representing 120 units. Mark 96 units on the bar and visually identify the difference, which is 24 units. This visual difference can help in understanding that 24 out of 120 is a 20% reduction.

D)90000
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population of the city after 2 years, given that it increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000.

### Method 1: Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate the population after the first year:**
   - The population increases by 5% in the first year.
   - Increase = 5% of 78,000 = 0.05 * 78,000 = 3,900
   - Population after the first year = 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900

2. **Calculate the population after the second year:**
   - The population increases by 5% in the second year.
   - Increase = 5% of 81,900 = 0.05 * 81,900 = 4,095
   - Population after the second year = 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995

Thus, the population after 2 years will be 85,995.

### Method 2: Using the Compound Interest Formula

The population growth can be modeled using the compound interest formula:
\[ P = P_0 (1 + r)^t \]
where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial population (78,000),
- \( r \) is the growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( t \) is the time in years (2 years).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 78,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^2 \]
\[ P = 78,000 \times (1.05)^2 \]
\[ P = 78,000 \times 1.1025 \]
\[ P = 85,995 \]

### Method 3: Estimation

For a quick estimation, you can approximate the increase:
- 5% of 78,000 is about 3,900.

E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must achieve to reach a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees, given his base salary and commission rate.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Identify the components of the servant's income:**
   - Fixed monthly salary: 1500 Rupees
   - Commission on sales: 15% of the monthly sales

2. **Set up the equation for the total monthly income:**
   - Total income = Fixed salary + Commission
   - We want the total income to be 6000 Rupees.

3. **Express the commission in terms of sales:**
   - Commission = 15% of sales = 0.15 * Sales

4. **Formulate the equation:**
   - 6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * Sales

5. **Solve for Sales:**
   - Subtract the fixed salary from the total income:
     \[
     6000 - 1500 = 0.15 \times \text{Sales}
     \]
     \[
     4500 = 0.15 \times \text{Sales}

Since the loan is paid back in equal monthly installments, we can assume a simple interest model for each month. The monthly interest rate can be calculated using the formula for simple interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the total interest for the year is Rs.18, the principal is Rs.360, and the time is 1 year (12 months). We need to find the annual interest rate, so we rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{18}{360 \times 1} = \frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \]

Convert this to a percentage:
\[ \text{Rate} = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\% \]

### Conclusion
The interest rate is 5%. Therefore, the correct choice is:
```
D) 5%
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Visual Aids**: A timeline diagram could help visualize the monthly payments and the accumulation of interest over time.
- **Estimation**: By estimating the interest as a percentage of the principal, you can quickly see that Rs.18 is 5% of Rs.360.
- **Discussion**: Discussing with others might reveal alternative methods, such as using financial formulas for annuities, but in this case, simple interest suffices due to the straightforward nature of the problem.",False,,,,,

E)45.86%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between percentage decrease and the subsequent percentage increase required to return to the original value.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: Assume the original price of the product is \( P \).

2. **Price Reduction**: The price is reduced by 30%. This means the new price is:
   \[
   P_{\text{new}} = P - 0.3P = 0.7P
   \]

3. **Required Increase**: We need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price back to the original price \( P \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \). The new price after the increase should be equal to the original price:
   \[
   0.7P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   0.7 \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1

E)286",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins of each denomination are in the pouch. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of each type of coin (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee).

2. **Convert Rupees to Paise:**
   - Since 1 rupee = 100 paise, Rs. 700 = 70000 paise.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total value of the coins can be expressed as:
     \[
     25x + 50x + 100x = 70000

D)Rs. 3937.50
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's total monthly income based on his spending and savings rate. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Savings Rate**: The man saves 12.5% of his income. In decimal form, this is 0.125.

2. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( I \) be the man's total monthly income.
   - He spends Rs. 3500 per month.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The amount he saves is 12.5% of his income, which can be expressed as \( 0.125 \times I \).
   - The amount he spends is the remainder of his income after savings, which is \( I - 0.125 \times I \).

4. **Express Spending in Terms of Income**:
   - The spending can be expressed as \( 0.875 \times I \) (since \( 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 \)).

5. **Equation for Spending**:
   - We know he spends Rs. 3500, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     0.875 \times I = 3500
     \]

6. **Solve for \( I \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 0.875 to find \( I \):

A)4
B)5
C)7
D)6
E)8",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to transport 29,400 toys, given the packing and loading conditions.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the number of toys in one box:**
   - One dozen equals 12 items.
   - Five dozen toys mean \(5 \times 12 = 60\) toys per box.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys in one tempo:**
   - Each tempo carries 98 boxes.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60\).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(98 \times 60 = 5880\) toys per tempo.

4. **Determine how many tempos are needed for 29,400 toys:**
   - We need to find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys.
   - Divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry: \(\frac{29400}{5880}\).

5. **Perform the division:**
   - \(\frac{29400}{5880} = 5\).

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to transport 29,400 toys in one round.

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 is 45.

To further understand this, let's break it down:

1. **Visual Aid**: Imagine labeling each orange from 1 to 10. You are selecting 2 distinct numbers from this set. The first choice gives you 10 options, and the second choice gives you 9 options (since one orange is already chosen). However, since the order doesn't matter (choosing orange 1 and then orange 2 is the same as choosing orange 2 and then orange 1), you divide by the number of ways to arrange 2 items, which is 2!.

2. **Estimation**: If you think about smaller numbers, say choosing 2 oranges from 4, you can list them: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4). This gives 6 combinations, which matches \( C(4, 2) = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \).

3. **Discussion**: Discussing with others might reveal alternative methods, such as using Pascal's Triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two directly above it. The 10th row (starting from 0) and 2nd column (also starting from 0) would give the same result.

54,,"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and calculate the work done by each painter individually. Let's start by understanding the rate at which each painter works:

1. **Mr. Brown's Rate**: He can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
2. **Mr. Black's Rate**: He can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
3. **Mr. Blue's Rate**: He can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.

Now, let's calculate the work done by each painter:

- **Mr. Brown's Contribution**: He works for 8 days before going on vacation. In 8 days, he paints:
  \[
  8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ houses}
  \]

- **Mr. Black's Contribution**: After Mr. Brown goes on vacation, Mr. Black works for 6 days. In 6 days, he paints:
  \[
  6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black together:
\[
\frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

The total contract is to paint 3 houses. Therefore, the remaining work to be done by Mr. Blue is:
\[
3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

Finally, let's calculate how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining \(\frac{11}{12}\) of a house:
\[
\text{Days for Mr. Blue} = \frac{\frac{11}{12}}{\frac{1}{12}} = 11 \text{ days}

A)272 minutes
B)304 minutes
C)190 minutes
D)70 minutes
E)35 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again. This is a classic problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which in this case are 16 and 17.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Train A departs every 16 minutes.
   - Train B departs every 17 minutes.
   - We need to find the smallest time interval after which both trains will depart together again.

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
   - Since 16 and 17 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product.

3. **Calculate the LCM:**
   - \( \text{LCM}(16, 17) = 16 \times 17 \)
   - Calculate: \( 16 \times 17 = 272 \)

4. **Verification:**
   - Check if 272 is divisible by both 16 and 17:
     - \( 272 \div 16 = 17 \) (an integer)
     - \( 272 \div 17 = 16 \) (an integer)
   - Since 272 is divisible by both, it confirms that 272 is indeed the LCM.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both trains will leave the station simultaneously again after 272 minutes.

### Visual Aid:
- You can visualize this by drawing a timeline and marking every 16 minutes for Train A and every 17 minutes for Train B. The first point where both marks coincide will be at 272 minutes.

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and use a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

1. **Outer Cube Dimensions**: The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm.
2. **Thickness of the Cube**: The thickness of the hollow part is 1 cm.
3. **Inner Cube Dimensions**: The inner hollow part will have a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is on all sides.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Smaller Cubes

1. **Total Smaller Cubes in the Outer Cube**: 
   - The outer cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - Total smaller cubes in a 5 cm cube = \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).

2. **Smaller Cubes in the Inner Hollow Part**:
   - The inner hollow part is a cube of side 3 cm.
   - Total smaller cubes in a 3 cm cube = \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).

3. **Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Cube**:
   - The hollow cube is the outer cube minus the inner hollow part.
   - Total smaller cubes in the hollow structure = \(125 - 27 = 98\).

### Step 3: Calculate the Painted and Unpainted Faces

1. **Painted Faces**:
   - All the outer surfaces of the hollow cube are painted.
   - Each face of the outer cube has \(5 \times 5 = 25\) smaller cubes.
   - Total painted faces = 6 faces \(\times 25 = 150\) painted faces.

2. **Unpainted Faces**:
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - Total faces of all smaller cubes = \(98 \times 6 = 588\) faces.
   - Unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = \(588 - 150 = 438\).

1. **Identify the total percentage of cocoa-flavored chocolates:**
   - We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla-flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates must be vanilla flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

3. **Calculate the percentage of squashed vanilla-flavored chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the rest (which are vanilla flavored) are squashed.
   - So, 90% of the 90% vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored.

4. **Find the percentage of vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored, the remaining vanilla-flavored chocolates are not squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% (total vanilla) - 81% (squashed vanilla) = 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

Thus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog jumps up 3 meters but then falls back 2 meters. Therefore, the net progress each day is \(3 - 2 = 1\) meter.

2. **Calculate Days for Initial Progress**: Since the well is 30 meters deep, we need to determine how many days it will take for the frog to reach or exceed 30 meters.

3. **Consider the Last Jump**: It's important to note that on the day the frog reaches the top, it won't fall back. Therefore, we need to calculate how many days it takes for the frog to reach 27 meters, because on the next day, the frog will jump 3 meters and reach 30 meters, exiting the well.

4. **Calculate Days to Reach 27 Meters**: 
   - Since the frog makes a net progress of 1 meter per day, it will take 27 days to reach 27 meters.

5. **Final Jump**: On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters from 27 meters, reaching 30 meters and exiting the well.

59,,"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find five consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and explore different methods to tackle it.

### Step 1: Define the Consecutive Odd Numbers

Let's denote the five consecutive odd numbers as:
- \( n \)
- \( n+2 \)
- \( n+4 \)
- \( n+6 \)
- \( n+8 \)

These are consecutive because each number is 2 more than the previous one, and they are odd numbers.

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

### Step 3: Condition for Perfect Square

We need this sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as \( k^2 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \]
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

### Step 4: Check for Two-Digit Odd Numbers

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need:
- \( 10 \leq n \leq 99 \)
- \( n \) is odd

Substitute \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \) into the inequality:
\[ 10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99 \]

Solving for \( k \):
\[ 14 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103 \]
\[ 7 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5 \]

The integer values for \( k^2 \) are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49 (since these are perfect squares within the range).

### Step 5: Calculate Possible Values of \( n \)

For each \( k^2 \):
- \( k^2 = 9 \): \( n = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 16 \): \( n = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 25 \): \( n = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 36 \): \( n = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 49 \): \( n = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \) (odd)

### Step 6: Verify the Choices

From the calculations, the only two-digit odd number that fits is 94. However, 94 is not in the given choices. Let's verify if any of the choices can be part of a sequence that satisfies the condition.

### Step 7: Check Each Choice

- **A) 47**: Check if 47 can be part of a sequence:
  - Sequence: 45, 47, 49, 51, 53
  - Sum: \( 45 + 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 = 245 \)
  - \( \frac{245}{10} = 24.5 \) (not a perfect square)

- **B) 91**: Check if 91 can be part of a sequence:
  - Sequence: 89, 91, 93, 95, 97
  - Sum: \( 89 + 91 + 93 + 95 + 97 = 465 \)
  - \( \frac{465}{10} = 46.5 \) (not a perfect square)

- **C) 41**: Check if 41 can be part of a sequence:
  - Sequence: 39, 41, 43, 45, 47
  - Sum: \( 39 + 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 = 215 \)
  - \( \frac{215}{10} = 21.5 \) (not a perfect square)

- **D) 67**: Check if 67 can be part of a sequence:
  - Sequence: 65, 67, 69, 71, 73
  - Sum: \( 65 + 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 = 345 \)
  - \( \frac{345}{10} = 34.5 \) (not a perfect square)

- **E) 44**: Check if 44 can be part of a sequence:

   - **Football:** 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).
   - **Cricket:** \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the total students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).
   - **Basketball:** 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate the Number of Students Not Interested in Any Games:**
   We are given that 20 students are not interested in any games.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:
   \[
   0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
   \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal to make calculations easier:
   \[
   0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   0.98x + 20 = x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:
   \[
   20 = x - 0.98x
   \]
   \[
   20 = 0.02x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Football: \( 0.08 \times 1000 = 80 \) students
   - Cricket: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 1000 = 800 \) students
   - Basketball: \( 0.10 \times 1000 = 100 \) students
   - Not interested in any games: 20 students

   Total: \( 80 + 800 + 100 + 20 = 1000 \) students

The calculations confirm that the total number of students in the class is 1000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( Q \) be the age of Q.
   - Let \( R \) be the age of R.
   - Let \( T \) be the age of T.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - The problem states: ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.""
     - This can be translated into the equation: \( R - Q = Q - T \).

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation: \( R - Q = Q - T \) to \( R + T = 2Q \).

4. **Use the Given Information:**
   - We are given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years: \( R + T = 50 \).

5. **Set Up the System of Equations:**
   - From the above, we have two equations:
     1. \( R + T = 50 \)
     2. \( R + T = 2Q \)

6. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Since both equations equal \( R + T \), we can set them equal to each other:
     \[
     50 = 2Q
     \]
   - Solve for \( Q \):
     \[
     Q = 25
     \]

7. **Find the Difference Between R and Q's Age:**
   - From the equation \( R + T = 2Q \), we know \( R + T = 50 \) and \( 2Q = 50 \), so \( Q = 25 \).
   - Substitute \( Q = 25 \) back into the equation \( R + T = 50 \):
     \[
     R + T = 50
     \]
   - We need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( R - Q \).
   - From the equation \( R - Q = Q - T \), we know:
     \[
     R - 25 = 25 - T
     \]
   - Rearrange to find \( R - Q \):
     \[
     R - 25 = 25 - T \implies R = 50 - T
     \]
   - Substitute \( R = 50 - T \) into \( R + T = 50 \):
     \[
     (50 - T) + T = 50
     \]
   - This equation is always true, confirming our setup is correct.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The difference between R and Q's age is \( R - Q = Q - T \).
   - Since \( Q = 25 \), the difference \( R - Q = 25 - T \).
   - However, without specific values for R and T, we cannot determine a specific numerical difference between R and Q's age.

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matches Sachin played in the season. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Batting Average:**
   - The batting average is calculated as the total number of runs scored divided by the total number of matches played.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played before the finals.
   - Let \( y \) be the total number of runs scored before the finals.

   Given that Sachin's batting average before the finals is 51, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{y}{x} = 51 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 51x
   \]

3. **Consider the Finals:**
   - In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs. Therefore, the total runs after the finals is \( y + 78 \).
   - The total number of matches after the finals is \( x + 1 \).

   Given that his new batting average is 54, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   \frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
   \]

   - Multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \) to clear the fraction:
   \[
   51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
   \]

   - Expand the right side:
   \[
   51x + 78 = 54x + 54

C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can represent \( n \) types of books.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book. The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes**: The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of single letter codes and pair of letters codes:
   \[
   n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}

We need this total to be at least 10, as there are 10 types of books. Let's calculate this for different values of \( n \):

- **For \( n = 3 \):**

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle given its area and a relationship between its length and breadth.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( b \) be the breadth of the rectangle in meters.
   - Then, the length \( l \) can be expressed in terms of the breadth: \( l = 4b + 1 \).

2. **Use the Area Formula:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = l \times b \).
   - We know the area is 150 square meters, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     (4b + 1) \times b = 150
     \]

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     4b^2 + b = 150
     \]
   - Rearrange it into a standard quadratic form:
     \[
     4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
     \]
   - Use the quadratic formula to solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
     \]
     where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, \( \sqrt{2401} = 49 \).

   - Solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25
     \]
   - Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense, we have \( b = 6 \).

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 25
     \]

5. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(l + b)
     \]
   - Substitute the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
     \[
     P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{9\%} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{8\%} = 12.5
     \]

3. **Determine the Minimum Grams Required:**
   - To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated above because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of grams required is the greater of 11.11 and 12.5, which is 12.5 grams.

   - **Small Cakes:**
     - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
     - To make 700 small cakes, the total hours needed = 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.

4. **Determine the Total Helper-Hours Required:**
   - We need 10 helper-hours for large cakes and 20 helper-hours for small cakes.
   - Total helper-hours required = 10 hours (large cakes) + 20 hours (small cakes) = 30 helper-hours.

5. **Calculate the Number of Helpers Required:**
   - The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
   - Total helper-hours required = 30.

   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of falafel in one roll.
   - Let \( B \) represent the amount of falafel in one baguette.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - From the first statement: ""Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.""

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Discount**: 
   - The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items. This means that the selling price on the discount day is 80% of the original price.

2. **Express the Discounted Price**:
   - If the original price of an item is \( P \), then the discounted price is \( 0.8P \).

3. **Determine the Required Increase**:
   - To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.8P \), we need to find the percentage increase from \( 0.8P \) to \( P \).

4. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - The increase needed is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).

5. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - The percentage increase is calculated as the increase divided by the discounted price, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100\%

   - Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{0.2P}{0.8P} = \frac{0.2}{0.8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25

A)18cm
B)22cm
C)20cm
D)30cm
E)28cm",B,"To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given that the length of the rectangle is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters, you can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (8 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm}) \]

First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

\[ 8 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm} = 11 \, \text{cm} \]

Next, multiply this sum by 2 to find the perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 11 \, \text{cm} = 22 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 22 centimeters. The correct choice is:

B) 22cm

To further understand the problem, you can visualize the rectangle by drawing it on a piece of paper or using graph paper. Label the length as 8 cm and the width as 3 cm.

A)520
B)720
C)920
D)None
E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 6 different books on a shelf. This is a classic permutation problem where we are arranging all items in a set.

The formula for permutations of \( n \) distinct items is given by \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

In this case, we have 6 books, so we need to calculate \( 6! \).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate \( 6! \):**

   \[
   6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**

   - First, calculate \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)
   - Then, \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)
   - Next, \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \)
   - Then, \( 360 \times 2 = 720 \)
   - Finally, \( 720 \times 1 = 720 \)

Thus, the total number of ways to arrange the 6 books is \( 720 \).

3. **Verify with estimation:**

   - Since \( 6! \) involves multiplying several numbers, we can estimate by rounding some numbers to make sure our answer is reasonable.
   - For example, \( 6 \approx 5 \), \( 5 \approx 5 \), \( 4 \approx 4 \), \( 3 \approx 3 \), \( 2 \approx 2 \), and \( 1 \approx 1 \).
   - Estimating: \( 5 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 600 \), which is close to 720, confirming our calculation is in the right ballpark.

4. **Conclusion:**

   The number of ways to arrange the books is \( 720 \), which corresponds to choice B.

D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the fence in feet, given the width of each picket and the space between them.

1. **Understand the components of the fence:**
   - Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
   - There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

2. **Calculate the total length in inches:**
   - For \( x \) pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.
   - There are \( x - 1 \) spaces between \( x \) pickets, each 6 inches wide, so the total space is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Combine the lengths:**
   - Total length in inches = Width of pickets + Total space
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1) \)

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( \frac{x}{2} + 6x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{12x}{2} = \frac{13x}{2} \)
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{13x}{2} - 6 \)

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, divide the total length in inches by 12 to convert to feet.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} \)

6. **Simplify the expression:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v_s \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
   - Let \( v_p = 10v_s \) be the speed of the plane in miles per hour.

2. **Time Relationship:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.
   - The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts, so the time the ship has been traveling when they meet is \( t + \frac{180}{v_s} \).

3. **Distance Equation:**
   - The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is \( v_s \times (t + \frac{180}{v_s}) \).
   - The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is \( v_p \times t = 10v_s \times t \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Since they meet at the same point, the total distance from the starting point is the same for both the ship and the plane. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     v_s \times (t + \frac{180}{v_s}) = 10v_s \times t

1. **Understand the Proportion**: 
   - In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released back into the forest.
   - In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of these were found to have tags.

2. **Set Up the Proportion**:
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is \( \frac{20}{500} \).
   - We assume this proportion is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire forest.

3. **Calculate the Proportion**:
   - Simplify the proportion: \( \frac{20}{500} = \frac{1}{25} \).

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the amount of money Arjun has.
- \( S \) as the amount of money Sajal has.

We have two conditions given in the problem:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
   - Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).

   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - According to the condition: \( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \).

Now, let's set up the equations based on these conditions:

1. \( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)
   - Simplifying: \( S + 30 = 2A - 60 \)
   - Rearranging: \( S = 2A - 90 \)  (Equation 1)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

Substitute \( S = 2A - 90 \) into \( A = 3S - 40 \):

2. **Calculate the Total Parts**: The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

3. **Determine the Length of One Part**: Since the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, each part is:
   \[
   \text{Length of one part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Calculate the New Length**: The new length corresponds to the 3 parts in the ratio. Therefore, the new length is:
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, 11.25 cm is not one of the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are interpreting the ratio correctly.

5. **Re-evaluate the Ratio Interpretation**: The ratio 5:3 indicates that the original length is divided into 5 parts, and the new length is 3 parts of the same size. Therefore, the new length should be:
   \[
   \text{New length} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cm} = 18 \text{ cm}
   \]

6. **Verify with Choices**: The correct choice that matches our calculation is:
   \[
   \text{A) 18}
   \]

Thus, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm.",True,,,,,
85,,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the reverse of \( M \).
   - We are given that \( M > N \) and \( M - N + 396c = 990 \).
   - We need to find how many values of \( M \) are more than 300.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The equation \( M - N + 396c = 990 \) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     99a - 99c + 396c = 990
     \]
   - Further simplification gives:
     \[
     99a + 297c = 990
     \]
   - Dividing the entire equation by 99:
     \[
     a + 3c = 10
     \]

3. **Solve for Possible Values of \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we solve \( a + 3c = 10 \) for integer values:
     - If \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) is a digit).
     - If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 7 \).
     - If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 4 \).
     - If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 1 \).
     - If \( c \geq 4 \), \( a \) becomes negative or non-digit.

4. **Check the Condition \( M > N \):**
   - For each valid pair \((a, c)\), check if \( M > N \):
     - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
     - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)
     - \( M > N \) implies \( 100a + c > 100c + a \) or \( 99a > 99c \) which simplifies to \( a > c \).

5. **Calculate Possible Values of \( M \):**
   - For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), \( M = 710 + b \) and \( N = 170 + b \). \( M > N \) is satisfied.
   - For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), \( M = 420 + b \) and \( N = 240 + b \). \( M > N \) is satisfied.
   - For \( (a, c) = (1, 3) \), \( M = 130 + b \) and \( N = 310 + b \). \( M > N \) is not satisfied.

6. **Count Values of \( M \) Greater Than 300:**
   - For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), \( M = 710 + b \) where \( b \) ranges from 0 to 9. All values are greater than 300.
   - For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), \( M = 420 + b \) where \( b \) ranges from 0 to 9. All values are greater than 300.

7. **Total Count:**
   - For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), there are 10 values of \( M \).
   - For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), there are 10 values of \( M \).
   - Total = 10 + 10 = 20.

D)700
E)none of these",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school, given that more than 501 students are there, and 20% took only physics while 28% took only math.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school.
   - 20% of \( N \) took only physics: \( 0.2N \).
   - 28% of \( N \) took only math: \( 0.28N \).

2. **Constraints:**
   - The total number of students is more than 501: \( N > 501 \).
   - The number of students who took only physics and only math must be integers.

3. **Calculate the Total Percentage:**
   - The total percentage of students who took either only physics or only math is \( 20\% + 28\% = 48\% \).

4. **Equation:**
   - Since 48% of the students took either only physics or only math, we have:
     \[
     0.48N = \text{number of students who took only physics or only math}
     \]

5. **Finding the Minimum \( N \):**
   - Since \( N \) must be more than 501 and \( 0.48N \) must be an integer, we need to find the smallest \( N \) such that \( 0.48N \) is an integer and \( N > 501 \).

6. **Checking the Options:**
   - **Option A: 550**
     \[
     0.48 \times 550 = 264 \quad (\text{integer})

     Since 550 is greater than 501 and 0.48 times 550 is an integer, this is a valid option.

   - **Option B: 570**
     \[
     0.48 \times 570 = 273.6 \quad (\text{not an integer})

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Five years ago, Raj's age was \(17 - 5 = 12\).
   - Let Rahim's age five years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago, so we have the equation:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{3}x

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 12 \times 3 = 36
     \]
   - So, Rahim was 36 years old five years ago.

4. **Find Rahim's current age:**
   - Add 5 years to Rahim's age from five years ago to find his current age:
     \[
     \text{Rahim's current age} = 36 + 5 = 41

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then divide that by the area the cow grazes per day to find the total number of days required.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Grazing Area

The cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14-foot long rope. This means the cow can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Substituting the given radius:

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find the number of days required to graze the entire area, divide the total area by the area grazed per day:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

### Conclusion

The cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the entire field. However, since 62 is not one of the provided options, we should consider the closest option, which is 61 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

### Step 1: Determine the Cost Price

1. **Given:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 27.50
   - Profit Percentage = 10%

2. **Formula for Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

3. **Formula for Profit Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Rearrange to find Cost Price (CP):**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \frac{10}{100} \times \text{Cost Price} = 0.1 \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}
   \]
   \[
   27.50 = \text{Cost Price} + 0.1 \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   27.50 = 1.1 \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost Price} = \frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75

1. **New Selling Price (SP') = Rs. 25.75**

2. **Determine Profit or Loss:**
   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{New Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75
   \]

3. **Since the result is positive, it is a profit.**

4. **Calculate Profit Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{0.75}{25}\right) \times 100 = 3\%

4. Tim, Zen, Susan (Susan is not to the left of Tim)
5. Zen, Susan, Tim (Susan is to the left of Tim)
6. Zen, Tim, Susan (Susan is not to the left of Tim)

From this list, we can see that there are 3 arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) be the fixed part of the bill.
   - Let \( V \) be the variable cost per call.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the first scenario (540 calls, Rs.1800 bill), we have:
     \[
     F + 540V = 1800

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):
     \[
     (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800

D)20
E)30",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to help us understand the overlap between the two categories: hardcover books and fiction books.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Books**: 45
2. **Hardcover Books**: 30
3. **Fiction Books**: 20

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. To do this, we can consider the following:

- If all 20 fiction books were hardcover, then the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction would be 20. This is because the total number of fiction books is 20, and if all of them are hardcover, then the overlap is maximized.

- We need to ensure that this scenario does not exceed the total number of hardcover books available. Since there are 30 hardcover books, having 20 of them as fiction is possible without exceeding the total.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Let's verify this with a simple diagram or Venn diagram approach:

- Draw two overlapping circles, one representing hardcover books and the other representing fiction books.
- Label the intersection of the two circles as the books that are both hardcover and fiction.
- The circle for hardcover books has a total of 30 books.
- The circle for fiction books has a total of 20 books.
- The intersection can have a maximum of 20 books, as this is the total number of fiction books, and it does not exceed the total number of hardcover books.

C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define some variables and set up equations based on the information given:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a weekday (Monday through Saturday).
   - Since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

2. **Calculate the Cost:**
   - The cost of newspapers from Monday to Saturday (6 days) is \( 6 \times x \times 1 = 6x \) dollars, since each newspaper costs $1.
   - The cost of newspapers on Sunday is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \) dollars, since each newspaper costs $4.

2. The total cost of the picnic is Rs. 96.
3. If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

4. The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them paid \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

We can set up the equation based on the information that the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

   \]

3. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify:
   - The original perimeter of the rectangle was calculated as 88 cm.
   - The side of the square calculated as 22 cm gives a perimeter of \(4 \times 22 = 88\) cm, which matches the original perimeter.

Thus, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. Therefore, the correct choice is:

A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount each nephew receives.
   - Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
   - Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
   - There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
   - There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

3. **Total Amount Distributed:**
   - The total amount distributed is the sum of the amounts received by the nephews, daughters, and sons:
   \[
   2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   43x = 8600
   \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200

A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of an arithmetic progression (A.P.) and how it applies to the ages of the club members.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The ages of the club members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.).
   - The common difference of the A.P. is 3 months, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a year.
   - The youngest member is 7 years old.
   - The sum of the ages of all members is 250 years.

2. **Setting Up the A.P.:**
   - Let the number of members be \( n \).
   - The age of the youngest member (first term of the A.P.) is 7 years.
   - The common difference \( d \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \) year.
   - The ages of the members can be represented as: \( 7, 7 + \frac{1}{4}, 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4}, \ldots, 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Sum of the A.P.:**
   - The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 7 \) and \( d = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - The sum of the ages is 250, so:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4}) = 250
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4} = 14 + \frac{n-1}{4}
     \]
   - Substitute back into the sum equation:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right) = 250
     \]
   - Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     n \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right) = 500
     \]
   - Distribute \( n \):
     \[
     14n + \frac{n(n-1)}{4} = 500
     \]
   - Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     56n + n(n-1) = 2000
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 56 \), and \( c = -2000 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 56^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3136 + 8000 = 11136
     \]
   - Calculate \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 \pm \sqrt{11136}}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{11136} \approx 105.5 \).
   - Solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 + 105.5}{2} \approx 24.75
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 - 105.5}{2} \text{ (not feasible as \( n \) must be positive)}
     \]

6. **Rounding and Conclusion:**
   - Since \( n \) must be a whole number, round 24.75 to the nearest whole number, which is 25.

D)3D/(M2-3M)
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more each remaining man will have to contribute if 3 men drop out of the original group of M men.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Contribution:**
   - The total cost of the gift is Rs. D.
   - Initially, there are M men, so each man contributes \( \frac{D}{M} \).

2. **After 3 Men Drop Out:**
   - Now, there are \( M - 3 \) men left.
   - The total cost of the gift remains Rs. D.
   - Each of the remaining \( M - 3 \) men will now contribute \( \frac{D}{M-3} \).

3. **Additional Contribution Required:**
   - The additional amount each remaining man has to contribute is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution.
   - This is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Additional Contribution} = \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M}
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - To simplify the expression, find a common denominator, which is \( M(M-3) \):
     \[
     \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M} = \frac{D \cdot M - D \cdot (M-3)}{M(M-3)}

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Determine the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - To make a 20% profit, the selling price should be 120% of the cost price.
   - Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit
   - Profit = 20% of CP = 0.20 * 1200 = Rs. 240
   - SP = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440

2. **Relate the Selling Price to the Marked Price:**
   - The selling price after a 20% discount should be Rs. 1440.
   - Let the marked price be \( M \).
   - After a 20% discount, the selling price is 80% of the marked price.
   - Therefore, 0.80 * M = 1440

3. **Calculate the Marked Price:**
   - Solve for \( M \) in the equation 0.80 * M = 1440.
   - \( M = \frac{1440}{0.80} \)
   - \( M = 1800 \)

Thus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800.

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm. Therefore, Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Train A travels at 40 kmph, and Train B travels at 72 kmph.
   - The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is: \(72 \text{ kmph} - 40 \text{ kmph} = 32 \text{ kmph}\).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up:**

A)15
B)28
C)30
D)53
E)59",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the water lilies. The key information given is that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered starting from one lily.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding the Growth Pattern:**
   - If the number of lilies doubles every two days, then starting with 1 lily, the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days is \(2^{30}\) (since 60 days / 2 days per doubling = 30 doublings).

2. **Initial Condition with 64 Lilies:**
   - If we start with 64 lilies, we need to determine how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered.
   - 64 is \(2^6\), which means starting with 64 lilies is equivalent to starting with \(2^6\) lilies.

3. **Calculating the Days:**
   - Since the lake is fully covered in 60 days starting from 1 lily, and 1 lily grows to \(2^{30}\) lilies in 60 days, we need to find out how many days it takes for \(2^6\) lilies to grow to \(2^{30}\) lilies.
   - The difference in the exponents is \(30 - 6 = 24\). This means it takes 24 doublings to go from \(2^6\) to \(2^{30}\).

4. **Converting Doublings to Days:**
   - Since each doubling takes 2 days, 24 doublings will take \(24 \times 2 = 48\) days.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, starting with 64 lilies, it will take 48 days for the lake to be fully covered.

However, we need to find the number of days from the start of the problem, which is 60 days minus the 48 days calculated, because we are starting with more lilies. So, the lake will be fully covered in \(60 - 12 = 12\) days from the start of the problem.

A)x2/y2 units
B)y3/x2 units
C)x3/y2 units
D)y2/x2 units
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work completed.

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initial Scenario:**
   - \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day can complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days.
   - Total work done is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Total Work} = \text{Number of Men} \times \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Number of Days}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total work done is:
     \[
     x \times x \times x = x^3 \text{ units of work}
     \]

2. **New Scenario:**
   - We need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.
   - Using the same formula for total work:
     \[
     \text{Total Work} = y \times y \times y = y^3 \text{ units of work}
     \]

3. **Comparing the Two Scenarios:**
   - We know from the initial scenario that \( x^3 \) units of work is equivalent to \( x \) units of work (since \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day for \( x \) days complete \( x \) units of work).
   - Therefore, \( x^3 \) units of work is the same as \( x \) units of work.

4. **Proportionate Work Calculation:**
   - We need to find the equivalent work done by \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day for \( y \) days, which is \( y^3 \) units of work.
   - Since \( x^3 \) units of work is equivalent to \( x \) units of work, we can set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{y^3}{x^3} \times x = \text{Equivalent Work in terms of } x
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \frac{y^3}{x^2} \text{ units of work}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The amount of work that can be completed by \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day in \( y \) days is \(\frac{y^3}{x^2}\) units.
   - Therefore, the correct choice is **B) \( \frac{y^3}{x^2} \) units**.

E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different quadrilaterals can be formed by selecting 4 points from the 6 available points: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Total Combinations of 4 Points:**
   We start by calculating the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of the 6 available points. This can be done using the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the total number of points, and \( k \) is the number of points to choose. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \).
   \[
   \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4! \times 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. **Verification:**
   Let's verify by listing the combinations:
   - Choose 4 points from A, B, C, D, E (ignoring F): 
     - ABCD, ABCE, ABDE, ACDE, BCDE (5 combinations)
   - Choose 3 points from A, B, C, D, E and include F:
     - ABF, ACF, ADF, AEF, BCF, BDF, BEF, CDF, CEF, DEF (10 combinations)

3. **Visualizing the Combinations:**
   - **Without F:** The combinations ABCD, ABCE, ABDE, ACDE, BCDE form quadrilaterals on the perimeter of the pentagon.
   - **With F:** Each combination with F forms a quadrilateral with F as one of the vertices and three other vertices from the pentagon.

4. **Conclusion:**
   By adding the two sets of combinations, we have:
   - 5 quadrilaterals without F
   - 10 quadrilaterals with F

Thus, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is \( 5 + 10 = 15 \).

C)140°
D)160°
E)220°",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the arcs and the points on the circle. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference.
   - Minor arc AC is 160°.
   - Minor arc BD is 150°.
   - Point B bisects minor arc AC.

2. **Visualizing the Circle:**
   - Draw a circle and place points A and C such that the arc AC is 160°.
   - Since B bisects arc AC, it means that arc AB = arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.

3. **Analyzing Arc BD:**
   - Arc BD is given as 150°.

4. **Finding Arc AD:**
   - We need to find the measure of minor arc AD.
   - Since B is between A and C, and D is somewhere on the circle, we need to consider the circle's total 360°.

5. **Using the Circle's Total:**
   - The total degrees in a circle is 360°.
   - We have arcs AB = 80°, BC = 80°, and BD = 150°.
   - To find arc AD, we consider the circle's total: 
     - Arc AD = 360° - (Arc BC + Arc CD)
     - We know Arc BC = 80°.
     - Arc CD is part of Arc BD, so Arc CD = Arc BD - Arc BC = 150° - 80° = 70°.

6. **Calculating Arc AD:**
   - Arc AD = Arc AB + Arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.
   - However, since we are looking for the minor arc AD, we need to consider the smaller arc:
   - Minor Arc AD = 360° - Arc CD = 360° - 70° = 290°.

7. **Re-evaluating:**
   - It seems there was a miscalculation. Let's re-evaluate:
   - Arc AD should be calculated as the sum of Arc AB and Arc BD, considering the circle's total:
   - Arc AD = Arc AB + Arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.
   - Since this is greater than 180°, we need to consider the smaller arc:
   - Minor Arc AD = 360° - 230° = 130°.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of minor arc AD is 130°.

B)15%
C)25%

- Let \( W \) be the set of employees who take a winter vacation.
- Let \( S \) be the set of employees who take a summer vacation.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation, so \( |W| = 75\% \).
2. 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation, so \( |W \cap S| = 40\% \).
3. 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

We need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is represented by \( |S - W| \).

First, let's determine the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither, 80% take at least one type of vacation.

Next, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation:

\[
|W \cup S| = |W| + |S| - |W \cap S|
\]

We know that \( |W \cup S| = 80\% \) and \( |W \cap S| = 40\% \). Substituting the known values:

\[
80\% = 75\% + |S| - 40\%
\]

Solving for \( |S| \):

\[
80\% = 75\% + |S| - 40\%
\]
\[
80\% = 35\% + |S|
\]
\[
|S| = 45\%
\]

Now, we know that 45% of employees take a summer vacation. To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we subtract those who take both from those who take a summer vacation:

\[
|S - W| = |S| - |W \cap S| = 45\% - 40\% = 5\%

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%. The correct answer is:

In this problem:
- \(\text{Base}_1 = 10\) m (the top width of the canal)
- \(\text{Base}_2 = 6\) m (the bottom width of the canal)
- \(\text{Area} = 640\) square meters
- \(\text{Height} = \text{Depth of the canal}\)

We need to find the height (depth) of the canal. Plugging the known values into the formula, we get:

\[

Simplify the equation:

\[

\[

A)70
B)30
C)3
D)7
E)5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matches played by the tennis team and then calculate how many matches they lost.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The team won 20 matches.
   - They lost 30% of their matches.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played.
   - The number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches, which is \( 0.3x \).

3. **Relating Wins and Losses:**
   - The total number of matches is the sum of matches won and matches lost:
     \[
     x = \text{matches won} + \text{matches lost}
     \]
   - We know the team won 20 matches, so:
     \[
     x = 20 + 0.3x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x - 0.3x = 20
     \]
     \[
     0.7x = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.7 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{0.7} = \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.57
     \]
   - Since the number of matches must be a whole number, round 28.57 to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

5. **Calculating Matches Lost:**
   - If the total number of matches is 29, then the number of matches lost is:
     \[
     0.3 \times 29 = 8.7
     \]
   - Since the number of matches lost must also be a whole number, we need to check our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the rounding:
     - If we round 28.57 to 29, the calculation of 0.3 times 29 gives a non-integer, which suggests a mistake in rounding.
     - Instead, let's consider the closest integer that satisfies the equation:
       - If \( x = 30 \), then \( 0.3 \times 30 = 9 \).
       - If \( x = 28 \), then \( 0.3 \times 28 = 8.4 \).

6. **Re-evaluating:**
   - Let's try \( x = 30 \) again:
     - Matches won: 20
     - Matches lost: \( 0.3 \times 30 = 9 \)
     - Total matches: 20 + 9 = 29, which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The team lost 9 matches, but this doesn't match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the choices:

The point is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, and the fan is rotating at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. We need to find the distance traveled by this point in 30 seconds.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the Circumference of the Circle:**
   - The point is 10 centimeters from the center, which means the radius of the circle is 10 centimeters.
   - The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ centimeters}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Revolutions in 30 Seconds:**
   - The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute.
   - First, convert the time from seconds to minutes: 30 seconds is \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) minutes.
   - Calculate the number of revolutions in 0.5 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Revolutions in 0.5 minutes} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ revolutions}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Distance Traveled:**
   - The distance traveled by the point is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference of the circle:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 150 \times 20\pi = 3000\pi \text{ centimeters}

\[ x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

We can try to simplify the expression by recognizing patterns or using algebraic identities. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 \]

This is because:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 = n^2 + 2 \cdot n \cdot 4\sqrt{n} + 2 \cdot n \cdot 4 + (4\sqrt{n})^2 + 2 \cdot 4\sqrt{n} \cdot 4 + 4^2 \]

\[ = n^2 + 8n\sqrt{n} + 8n + 16n + 32\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

\[ = n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) simplifies to:

\[ x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the range of \( x \) given \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

1. **Calculate the minimum value of \( x \):**

   - For \( n = 36 \):
     \[ x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64 \]

2. **Calculate the maximum value of \( x \):**

   - For \( n = 72 \):
     \[ x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4 \]

     To find \( 4\sqrt{72} \), note that \( \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \).

     Therefore:
     \[ 4\sqrt{72} = 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} = 24\sqrt{2} \]

     Approximating \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \):
     \[ 24\sqrt{2} \approx 24 \times 1.414 = 33.936 \]

     So:
     \[ x \approx 72 + 33.936 + 4 = 109.936 \]

Thus, the range of \( x \) is approximately \( 64 \leq x \leq 109.936 \).

1. **Understand the Profit Sharing:**
   - The profit is shared in the ratio of the product of capital and the time for which the capital is invested.
   - Let’s denote the number of months C was in the business as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the Investment Time for Each Partner:**
   - A invested Rs.40,000 for 12 months.
   - B invested Rs.60,000 for \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) months (since B joined 2 months after A).

117,,"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
A)8.75
B)8.79
C)8.75
D)8.71
E)8.72",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the square paper and then subtract the area of the two semicircles that are cut out.

1. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   - The side of the square is given as 20 cm.
   - The area of the square is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of square} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the semicircles:**
   - The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.
   - The radius of each semicircle is half of the diameter:
     \[
     \text{Radius} = \frac{20 \, \text{cm}}{2} = 10 \, \text{cm}
     \]
   - The area of a full circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area of circle} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 = \pi \times (10 \, \text{cm})^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2
     \]
   - The area of one semicircle is half of the area of the full circle:
     \[
     \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{100\pi}{2} = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2
     \]
   - Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:
     \[
     \text{Total area of semicircles} = 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the total area of the semicircles from the area of the square:
     \[
     \text{Remaining area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2
     \]

4. **Approximate the value:**
   - Use the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
     \[
     100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining area is approximately:
     \[
     \text{Remaining area} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 314 \, \text{cm}^2 = 86 \, \text{cm}^2

A)M + N / 8
B)2M + N / 8
C)M + N / 4
D)M + 3N / 8
E)M + N / 5",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average speed for the athlete's combined activities of running and biking. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Distance**: The athlete runs \( M \) miles and bikes \( N \) miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled is \( M + N \) miles.

2. **Total Time**: The athlete spends 4 hours running and another 4 hours biking. Therefore, the total time spent is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) hours.

3. **Average Speed Calculation**: The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Thus, the average speed is:

   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{M + N}{8}

- C) \( \frac{M + N}{4} \)
- D) \( \frac{M + 3N}{8} \)
- E) \( \frac{M + N}{5} \)

The correct choice is A) \( \frac{M + N}{8} \), as it matches our calculated average speed.

To ensure understanding, let's visualize this with a simple example:

- Suppose the athlete runs 8 miles (M = 8) and bikes 16 miles (N = 16).
- Total distance = 8 + 16 = 24 miles.
- Total time = 8 hours.
- Average speed = \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) miles per hour.

A)93 men
B)94 men
C)95 men
D)96 men
E)97 men",D,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ""man-days,"" which is a way to measure the amount of work done. One man working for one day is considered one man-day. Here's how we can break down the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Man-Days for the Original Task:**
   - We know that 8 men working for 6 days complete the work.
   - Total man-days required = Number of men × Number of days = 8 men × 6 days = 48 man-days.

2. **Determine Man-Days Required for 1/2 Day:**
   - We need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.
   - The equation for this scenario is: \( x \) men × 0.5 day = 48 man-days.

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x \times 0.5 = 48
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{0.5} = 96
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day.

The correct answer is **D) 96 men**.

**Visual Aid:**
- You can visualize this problem by drawing a bar representing the total work, divided into 48 equal parts (each part representing a man-day). Then, show how 8 men complete these parts in 6 days, and how 96 men would complete the same parts in 1/2 day.

**Estimation Technique:**
- You can also estimate by considering that if 8 men take 6 days, then doubling the number of men would halve the time required. Continuing this logic, you can see that to reduce the time to 1/2 day, you need to multiply the number of men by 12 (since 6 days divided by 1/2 day is 12), leading to 8 men × 12 = 96 men.

### Step 1: Determine the composition of alloy X
Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. This can be simplified to 2:3. 

- Total parts in alloy X = 2 (zinc) + 3 (copper) = 5 parts
- Zinc in 40 grams of alloy X = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16\) grams
- Copper in 40 grams of alloy X = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 40 = 24\) grams

### Step 2: Determine the composition of alloy Y
Alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.

- Total parts in alloy Y = 7 (zinc) + 11 (copper) = 18 parts
- Zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y = \(\frac{7}{18} \times 60 = 23.33\) grams
- Copper in 60 grams of alloy Y = \(\frac{11}{18} \times 60 = 36.67\) grams

### Step 3: Combine the compositions to form alloy Z
Now, we combine the amounts of zinc and copper from alloys X and Y to form alloy Z.

- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 (from X) + 23.33 (from Y) = 39.33 grams
- Total copper in alloy Z = 24 (from X) + 36.67 (from Y) = 60.67 grams

### Step 4: Calculate the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z
The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

\[
\text{Ratio of zinc to copper} = \frac{39.33}{60.67}
\]

To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals:

\[
\frac{39.33 \times 100}{60.67 \times 100} = \frac{3933}{6067}

Now, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{3933}{6067}\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3933 and 6067 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

   - Total contribution = $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

2. **Determine the Cost per Senator:**
   - The total contribution of $20,000 influences 30 senators.
   - Therefore, the cost per senator = Total contribution / Number of senators = $20,000 / 30 senators = $666.67 per senator.

3. **Calculate Hoopsmot's Share:**
   - Hoopsmot's contribution is $16,000.
   - To find out how many senators Hoopsmot's contribution can influence, divide his contribution by the cost per senator:
   - Number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot = $16,000 / $666.67 ≈ 24 senators.

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If Hoopsmot influences 24 senators, then Smolapon influences the remaining senators.
   - Smolapon's contribution is $4,000.
   - Number of senators influenced by Smolapon = $4,000 / $666.67 ≈ 6 senators.
   - Total senators influenced = 24 (Hoopsmot) + 6 (Smolapon) = 30 senators, which matches the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the calculations, Hoopsmot can be considered to have influenced 24 senators.

D)None of these
E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations based on the information given. Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \).

We have two key pieces of information:
1. The difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000:
   \[
   x^2 - y^2 = 256000
   \]
2. The sum of the two numbers is 1000:
   \[
   x + y = 1000
   \]

The equation \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \) can be factored using the difference of squares formula:
\[
(x + y)(x - y) = 256000
\]

Since we know \( x + y = 1000 \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
1000(x - y) = 256000
\]

Now, solve for \( x - y \):
\[
x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256
\]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256

\[
2x = 1256

\[
x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628

Now, substitute \( x = 628 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 1000 \):
\[
628 + y = 1000

\[
y = 1000 - 628 = 372

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled at each speed:**

   - At 5 km/h for 6 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{km/h} \times 6 \, \text{h} = 30 \, \text{km}

A)2
B)3
C)4
D)5
E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.

1. **Understanding the Median**: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. If the median income is $3000, it means that at least one person earns $3000, and if there are an odd number of family members, this is the exact middle value. If there are an even number of family members, the median is the average of the two middle values.

2. **Understanding the Total Income**: The total income of the family is $9000. This is the sum of all individual incomes.

3. **Exploring the Options**:
   - **Option A (2 members)**: If there are 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two incomes could be $3000 and $3000, which would sum to $6000, not $9000. So, this option is not possible.
   
   - **Option B (3 members)**: If there are 3 members, the median is the income of the second person when arranged in order. If the median is $3000, one possible distribution could be $3000, $3000, and $3000, which sums to $9000. This fits the total income, so this option is possible.
   
   - **Option C (4 members)**: If there are 4 members, the median is the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes could be $3000 each. A possible distribution could be $3000, $3000, $3000, and $3000, which sums to $12000, not $9000. So, this option is not possible.
   
   - **Option D (5 members)**: If there are 5 members, the median is the income of the third person. For the median to be $3000, a possible distribution could be $3000, $3000, $3000, $0, and $3000, which sums to $9000. This fits the total income, so this option is possible.
   
   - **Option E (6 members)**: If there are 6 members, the median is the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes could be $3000 each. A possible distribution could be $3000, $3000, $3000, $3000, $0, and $0, which sums to $9000. This fits the total income, so this option is possible.

4. **Conclusion**: The possible options are B (3 members), D (5 members), and E (6 members). However, the simplest and most straightforward solution is B (3 members), where each member earns $3000, perfectly matching both the median and the total income.

2. **Calculate the total fare for adults:**
   - There are 4 adults, so the total fare for adults is \( 4 \times 140 = Rs. 560 \).

3. **Calculate the total fare for children:**
   - There are 3 children, so the total fare for children is \( 3 \times 70 = Rs. 210 \).

Let's define:
- \( n \) as the number of employees.
- \( x \) as the original contribution from each employee.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total amount raised initially is Rs. 6 lakh.
2. If each employee contributed Rs. 60 more, the total would be Rs. 6.24 lakh.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. \( n \times x = 600,000 \) (since the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh)
2. \( n \times (x + 60) = 624,000 \) (since the total contribution with Rs. 60 extra per employee is Rs. 6.24 lakh)

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 1:
\[ x = \frac{600,000}{n} \]

Substitute \( x \) in equation 2:
\[ n \times \left(\frac{600,000}{n} + 60\right) = 624,000 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 600,000 + 60n = 624,000 \]

Subtract 600,000 from both sides:
\[ 60n = 24,000 \]

Divide both sides by 60:

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
   - Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Number of voters not eligible = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Determine the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - Since there are two candidates, the winning candidate received more than half of the eligible votes by 15%.
   - Half of the eligible votes = 4,000 / 2 = 2,000
   - The winning candidate received 15% more than half of the votes.
   - 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600
   - Total votes for the winning candidate = Half of the votes + 15% of the votes = 2,000 + 600 = 2,600

   - The winning candidate received 2,600 votes.
   - The other candidate received the remaining votes: 4,000 - 2,600 = 1,400
   - The difference in votes between the two candidates = 2,600 - 1,400 = 1,200

   - 15% of 5,000 = 0.15 * 5,000 = 750
   - The winning candidate received half of the eligible votes plus 750.
   - Half of the eligible votes = 4,000 / 2 = 2,000

140,,"A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and use logical reasoning.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The store starts with 600 golf balls.
   - By the end of the day, 80% of the golf balls are sold.
   - The store sells an equal number of yellow and white golf balls.
   - All white golf balls are sold.

2. **Calculate the Number of Golf Balls Sold:**
   - 80% of 600 golf balls are sold.
   - Calculate 80% of 600: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   - So, 480 golf balls are sold.

3. **Determine the Number of White Golf Balls Sold:**
   - Since all white golf balls are sold and an equal number of yellow and white golf balls are sold, half of the 480 sold golf balls must be white.
   - Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is:
     \[
     \frac{480}{2} = 240
     \]

4. **Determine the Initial Number of Yellow Golf Balls:**
   - Since 240 white golf balls were sold and this was all the white golf balls, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.
   - The remaining golf balls at the start of the day were yellow.
   - Total golf balls at the start = 600
   - White golf balls at the start = 240
   - Therefore, yellow golf balls at the start = 600 - 240 = 360

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - The store sold 240 yellow and 240 white golf balls, totaling 480 golf balls, which matches the 80% sold.
   - All white golf balls were sold, and the number of yellow golf balls sold equals the number of white golf balls sold.

Thus, the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is 360.

A)12 metre
B)12.5 metre
C)13.5 metre
D)14 metre
E)15 metre",B,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. When two objects cast shadows under similar conditions (i.e., the angle of elevation of the sun is the same), the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow is constant.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
   - Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
   - Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

2. **Set up the proportion:**
   Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to its shadow.

   \[
   \frac{\text{Height of flagstaff}}{\text{Length of flagstaff's shadow}} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{\text{Length of building's shadow}}
   \]

   Plug in the known values:

   \[
   \frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{28.75}
   \]

3. **Solve for the height of the building:**
   Cross-multiply to solve for the height of the building:

   \[
   17.5 \times 28.75 = \text{Height of building} \times 40.25
   \]

   \[
   \text{Height of building} = \frac{17.5 \times 28.75}{40.25}

4. **Calculate the height:**
   Perform the multiplication and division:

   \[
   17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125

142,,"Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
A)3 hours
B)5 hours
C)6 hours
D)4 hours
E)7 hours",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the two cars to be 15 miles apart, given their different speeds.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Relative Speed:**
   - The first car travels at 55 mph.
   - The second car travels at 52 mph.
   - The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds: \( 55 \text{ mph} - 52 \text{ mph} = 3 \text{ mph} \).

2. **Determine the Time to Reach 15 Miles Apart:**
   - Since the relative speed is 3 mph, this means that every hour, the first car gets 3 miles further away from the second car.
   - We need to find out how many hours it will take for the distance between them to be 15 miles.

3. **Calculate the Time:**
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).
   - Here, the distance is 15 miles and the relative speed is 3 mph.
   - \(\text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the two cars to be 15 miles apart.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B) 5 hours**.

### Visual Aid:
To visualize this, you could draw a simple diagram with two lines representing the paths of the two cars. Mark the starting point and show the distance each car travels over time. The first car's line will be steeper due to its higher speed. After 5 hours, the distance between the two lines (representing the cars) will be 15 miles.

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)

We need to find \( P(B) \).

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:

\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. The correct choice is:

D)6: π
E)8:3",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cube and the sphere that fits inside it, and then find the ratio of these volumes.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A sphere fits inside a cube when the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.
   - Let's denote the side length of the cube as \( s \). Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is also \( s \).

2. **Volume of the Cube:**
   - The volume \( V_{\text{cube}} \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
     \[
     V_{\text{cube}} = s^3

This is a classic example of the ""pigeonhole principle,"" which states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Identify the total number of colors**: There are 5 different colors of ties: red, violet, blue, pink, and green.

2. **Apply the pigeonhole principle**: To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, consider the worst-case scenario where you pick the maximum number of ties without having two of the same color.

3. **Worst-case scenario**: In the worst-case scenario, you would pick one tie of each color before you start picking a second tie of any color. Since there are 5 colors, you would pick 5 ties (one of each color) without having two of the same color.

4. **Ensuring at least two ties of the same color**: To guarantee that you have at least two ties of the same color, you need to pick one more tie after picking one of each color. This means you need to pick a total of 6 ties.

B)60 %
C)55 %
D)70 %
E)58%",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP) of the oranges, and then determine the percentage gain.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**
   - The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450.
   - Therefore, the cost price per kg = Total cost / Total weight = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price (SP):**
   - The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg.
   - Therefore, the selling price for 90 kg = 90 kg * Rs. 7.50 per kg = Rs. 675.

3. **Calculate the Gain:**
   - Gain = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

4. **Calculate the Percentage Gain:**
   - Percentage Gain = (Gain / Cost Price) * 100
   - Percentage Gain = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

### Conclusion:

The percentage gain of the merchant is 50%. Therefore, the correct choice is:

**A) 50%**

   - Train N travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am).

   Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is \( D \).

   - Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \)
   - Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} \)

2. **Determine the time when both trains are moving towards each other:**

   - Train M starts at 5 am.
   - Train N starts at 7 am.

   Therefore, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours by the time Train N starts its journey. In these 2 hours, Train M covers a distance of \( \frac{D}{4} \times 2 = \frac{D}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered when both trains are moving towards each other:**

   - Remaining distance = \( D - \frac{D}{2} = \frac{D}{2} \).

4. **Calculate the relative speed of the two trains:**

   - Relative speed = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N
   - Relative speed = \( \frac{D}{4} + \frac{D}{3.5} \)

   To add these speeds, find a common denominator:

   - \( \frac{D}{4} = \frac{7D}{28} \)
   - \( \frac{D}{3.5} = \frac{2D}{7} = \frac{8D}{28} \)

   Therefore, the relative speed = \( \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \).

E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The situation described involves two similar triangles: one formed by the 4-inch tall ant and its shadow, and the other formed by the 6-inch tall ant and its shadow. Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Height of the first ant (shorter ant): 4 inches
   - Length of the shadow of the first ant: 10 inches
   - Height of the second ant (taller ant): 6 inches
   - Length of the shadow of the second ant: unknown (let's call it \( x \) inches)

2. **Set up the proportion using similar triangles:**

154,,"The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
A)2.6m
B)3.9m
C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. Let's denote the height of the room as \( h \) and the semi-perimeter as \( s \).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \) or \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).

2. **Calculate the Total Area to be Papered:**
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260, and the cost per meter of paper is Rs. 2. Therefore, the total length of paper used is \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \) meters.
   - The width of the paper is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. Thus, the total area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.
   - Since 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows, the actual area to be papered is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) square meters.

3. **Relate the Area to the Room Dimensions:**
   - The area of the walls to be papered is the perimeter of the room times the height, minus the area for doors and windows.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then, the area to be papered is \( P \times h = 80 \) square meters.

4. **Express Perimeter in Terms of Semi-Perimeter:**
   - The semi-perimeter \( s \) is half of the perimeter, so \( P = 2s \).

5. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \) and \( P = 2s \) into the equation for the area:
   \[
   2s \times \frac{2}{5} \times s = 80
   \]
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} s^2 = 80
   \]
   \[
   s^2 = 80 \times \frac{5}{4} = 100
   \]
   \[
   s = \sqrt{100} = 10
   \]

6. **Find the Height:**
   - Now that we have \( s = 10 \), substitute back to find \( h \):
   \[
   h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4
   \]

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters.

B)62
C)82
D)92
E)102",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of consecutive integers, \( k \), that sum up to 51, given that the smallest integer is -50.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Define the Sequence:**
   The sequence of \( k \) consecutive integers starting from -50 can be written as:
   \[
   -50, -49, -48, \ldots, (-50 + k - 1)
   \]

2. **Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum of these \( k \) consecutive integers is given by:
   \[
   S = (-50) + (-49) + (-48) + \ldots + (-50 + k - 1)
   \]

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   Here, the first term is -50 and the last term is \(-50 + k - 1\).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Substitute the known values into the formula:
   \[
   51 = \frac{k}{2} \times \left(-50 + (-50 + k - 1)\right)
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 - 50 + k - 1)
   \]
   \[
   51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( k \):**
   Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   102 = k(k - 101)
   \]
   Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   Use the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \):
   \[
   k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{101^2 + 4 \times 102}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10201 + 408}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10609}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}
   \]

   This gives two potential solutions for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102 \quad \text{and} \quad k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = -1
   \]

   Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we have:
   \[
   k = 102
   \]

### Conclusion:
The number of consecutive integers \( k \) is 102. Therefore, the correct answer is:

3. **Relate Selections to Students:**
   - Each student selects 2 songs.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of students surveyed.
   - The total number of selections made by all students is \( 2n \) because each student makes 2 selections.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of selections made by students (2n) should equal the total number of times songs were selected (50):
     \[
     2n = 50

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Identify the Key Speakers**: We have three key speakers: pm, mp, and mla. The condition is that pm must speak before mp, and mp must speak before mla.

2. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**: If there were no restrictions, the 10 speakers could be arranged in \(10!\) different ways.

3. **Account for the Restrictions**: The restriction is that pm must speak before mp, and mp must speak before mla. For any specific arrangement of these three speakers, there are \(3!\) (which is 6) possible ways to order them (pm, mp, mla; pm, mla, mp; mp, pm, mla; mp, mla, pm; mla, pm, mp; mla, mp, pm). However, only 1 of these 6 arrangements satisfies the condition (pm before mp before mla).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Initial Composition:**
   - The original mixture is 10 kg.
   - It contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
   - Therefore, the mixture has 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay.

2. **Desired Composition:**
   - We want the final mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay.
   - This means the final mixture should have 50% sand and 50% clay.

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount of the mixture removed and replaced with pure sand.**

4. **Composition After Removal:**
   - If \( x \) kg of the mixture is removed, it contains \( 0.3x \) kg of sand and \( 0.7x \) kg of clay.
   - The remaining mixture will then have \( 3 - 0.3x \) kg of sand and \( 7 - 0.7x \) kg of clay.

5. **Adding Pure Sand:**
   - We replace the removed \( x \) kg with \( x \) kg of pure sand.
   - The new amount of sand in the mixture becomes \( (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \) kg.
   - The amount of clay remains \( 7 - 0.7x \) kg.

6. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - For the mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay:
   \[
   3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x
   \]

7. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x

1. **Initial Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let's assume the man's initial income is \( I \).
   - He spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%. The new income is:
     \[
     I_{\text{new}} = I + 0.2I = 1.2I
     \]

3. **New Expenditure:**
   - Since the problem states that he spends 70% of his income, we assume he continues to spend 70% of his new income.
   - Therefore, his new expenditure is:
     \[
     E_{\text{new}} = 0.7 \times 1.2I = 0.84I
     \]

4. **Percentage of New Expenditure Relative to New Income:**
   - To find the percentage of his new expenditure relative to his new income, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of new expenditure} = \left(\frac{E_{\text{new}}}{I_{\text{new}}}\right) \times 100\%

165,,"If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true?
A)x > y
B)y^2 > x^2
C)-x^3 < y^2
D)–x < y
E)x < –y",B,"To tackle this problem, let's break it down step by step and analyze each choice based on the given conditions: \( x < 0 \), \( y > 0 \), and \(|x^3| > |y^2|\).

### Step 1: Understand the Given Conditions

1. **\( x < 0 \)**: This means \( x \) is a negative number.
2. **\( y > 0 \)**: This means \( y \) is a positive number.
3. **\(|x^3| > |y^2|\)**: This implies that the absolute value of \( x^3 \) is greater than the absolute value of \( y^2 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the Absolute Values

- Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^3 \) will also be negative, and \(|x^3| = -x^3\).
- Since \( y > 0 \), \( y^2 \) will be positive, and \(|y^2| = y^2\).

Given \(|x^3| > |y^2|\), we have:
\[ -x^3 > y^2 \]

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Choice

**A) \( x > y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( x \) cannot be greater than \( y \). This choice is false.

**B) \( y^2 > x^2 \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we cannot directly compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) without additional information. This choice is not necessarily true.

**C) \(-x^3 < y^2 \)**

- We have already established that \(-x^3 > y^2\) from the given condition \(|x^3| > |y^2|\). This choice is false.

**D) \(-x < y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \), \(-x\) is positive. Given \(-x^3 > y^2\), and knowing that \(-x^3\) is a larger positive number than \( y^2 \), it suggests that \(-x\) could be greater than \( y \). However, this requires further analysis or specific values to confirm, so this choice is not necessarily true.

**E) \( x < -y \)**

- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \(-y\) is negative. Given \( x < 0 \), it is indeed true that \( x < -y \) because \( x \) is a negative number and \(-y\) is also negative but less than zero. This choice is true.

The correct answer is **E) \( x < -y \)**. This choice must be true given the conditions provided.",False,,,,,
166,,"Printer A and Printer B can each print 1⁄2 page per second. How long will it take both printers working together to print 100 pages?
A)25 seconds
B)50 seconds
C)100 seconds
D)200 seconds
E)400 seconds",C,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use a systematic approach to find the solution.

### Step 1: Determine the Rate of Each Printer
Each printer can print \( \frac{1}{2} \) page per second. Therefore, the rate of each printer is:
- Printer A: \( \frac{1}{2} \) page/second
- Printer B: \( \frac{1}{2} \) page/second

### Step 2: Determine the Combined Rate of Both Printers
When both printers work together, their rates add up. So, the combined rate of both printers is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \text{ page/second} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Print 100 Pages
Since the combined rate of both printers is 1 page per second, we can calculate the time it takes to print 100 pages by dividing the total number of pages by the combined rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Pages}}{\text{Combined Rate}} = \frac{100 \text{ pages}}{1 \text{ page/second}} = 100 \text{ seconds} \]

### Step 4: Verify and Choose the Correct Answer
The calculation shows that it will take 100 seconds for both printers working together to print 100 pages. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C) 100 \text{ seconds}} \]

### Additional Methods
- **Estimation**: Since each printer prints half a page per second, together they print 1 page per second. For 100 pages, it would take approximately 100 seconds.
- **Visual Aid**: You could draw a timeline or a bar graph showing the pages printed over time to visually confirm that both printers together complete 100 pages in 100 seconds.

Discussing this approach with others might reveal alternative methods, such as using a formula for work problems or considering the problem in terms of fractions of the task completed per second. However, the straightforward calculation above efficiently leads to the correct answer.",False,,,,,

A)45
B)48
C)51
D)54
E)57",A,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed and the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

1. **Calculate the relative speed**: Since the ants are moving towards each other, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. 

   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = 9 \, \text{cm/hr} + 6 \, \text{cm/hr} = 15 \, \text{cm/hr}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken for the ants to meet**: We know the total distance between the two farms is 75 cm. Using the relative speed, we can find the time it takes for the ants to meet.

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \, \text{cm}}{15 \, \text{cm/hr}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance traveled by ant A**: Now that we know the time it takes for the ants to meet, we can calculate how far ant A travels in that time.

   \[
   \text{Distance traveled by ant A} = \text{Speed of ant A} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{cm/hr} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{cm}

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of trousers.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of shirts.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost equation is: \( 70T + 30S = 810 \).

3. **Maximize Trousers:**
   - To maximize the number of trousers, we should first calculate the maximum possible number of trousers that can be bought with Rs 810.
   - Calculate the maximum number of trousers: \( T = \left\lfloor \frac{810}{70} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Calculate Maximum Trousers:**
   - \( \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \).
   - The maximum integer value for \( T \) is 11.

5. **Check for Shirts:**
   - If \( T = 11 \), calculate the remaining money for shirts:
     - Total cost for 11 trousers: \( 11 \times 70 = 770 \).
     - Remaining money: \( 810 - 770 = 40 \).

6. **Calculate Number of Shirts:**
   - With Rs 40 remaining, calculate the number of shirts: \( S = \left\lfloor \frac{40}{30} \right\rfloor = 1 \).

7. **Verify the Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for 11 trousers and 1 shirt: \( 11 \times 70 + 1 \times 30 = 770 + 30 = 800 \).
   - This is within the budget of Rs 810.

8. **Ratio of Trousers to Shirts:**
   - The ratio of trousers to shirts is \( 11:1 \).

E)$3.73",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cover price per issue of the magazine. We know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and this represents a 25% saving off the total cover price.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Understand the relationship between the subscription price and the cover price:**
   - The subscription price is 75% of the total cover price because it represents a 25% saving. This means that the subscription price is 100% - 25% = 75% of the total cover price.

2. **Set up an equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cover price per issue.
   - The total cover price for 15 issues is \( 15x \).
   - Since the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price, we can write the equation:

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( H \) be the number of times the coin lands on heads.
   - Let \( T \) be the number of times the coin lands on tails.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of flips is 20, so:
     \[
     H + T = 20

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - From the second equation, express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
     \[
     T = \frac{2H}{3}
     \]
   - Substitute \( T \) in the first equation:
     \[
     H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20

     \[
     5H = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( H \):
     \[
     H = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( H = 12 \), then \( T = 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Check the money exchanged:
     - Christopher gives Jonathan \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars for heads.
     - Jonathan gives Christopher \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) dollars for tails.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from opposite points (X and Y) and travel towards each other.
   - Allen travels at 54 km/h, and Bob travels at 78 km/h.
   - They meet for the first time somewhere between X and Y.
   - After meeting, they continue to their respective destinations, turn around, and head back towards each other.
   - They meet for the second time, and by this time, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let the distance between X and Y be \( D \) km.
   - When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances they have traveled is \( D \).
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time taken to meet for the first time.
   - Allen's distance in \( t_1 \) is \( 54t_1 \) and Bob's distance is \( 78t_1 \).
   - Therefore, \( 54t_1 + 78t_1 = D \).

3. **First Meeting:**

4. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen travels the remaining distance to Y and back towards X, while Bob travels the remaining distance to X and back towards Y.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time from the first meeting to the second meeting.

5. **Substituting \( t_1 \):**
   - We know \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \).
   - Substituting into the equation \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \):
     \[
     \frac{D}{132} + t_2 = 2
     \]
   - Solving for \( t_2 \):
     \[
     t_2 = 2 - \frac{D}{132}
     \]

6. **Finding \( D \):**
   - Substitute \( t_2 \) back into the equation for the second meeting:
     \[
     54t_2 = 54 \left(2 - \frac{D}{132}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     54t_2 = 108 - \frac{54D}{132}
     \]
   - Since \( 54t_2 = 54t_1 + 54t_2 - 54t_1 = 48 \), we equate:

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the cost of repairing to the cost of purchasing new tires.

### Step 1: Calculate the average cost per year for new tires

- **Cost of new tires:** $180 per tire
- **Lifespan of new tires:** 4 years

The average cost per year for new tires is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average cost per year for new tires} = \frac{\text{Cost of new tires}}{\text{Lifespan of new tires}} = \frac{180}{4} = 45
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires

- **Cost of repairing current tires:** $40 per tire
- **Lifespan extension from repair:** 1 year

The average cost per year for repairing the current tires is simply the cost of the repair since it extends the life by one year:

\[
\text{Average cost per year for repairing tires} = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage increase

Now, we need to find out how much greater the average cost per year of the new tires is compared to the cost of repairing the current tires. We use the formula for percentage increase:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{\text{New cost per year} - \text{Repair cost per year}}{\text{Repair cost per year}}\right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{45 - 40}{40}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{5}{40}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the length of the longer piece of rope.
   - Since the other piece is 3 meters shorter, its length will be \( x - 3 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total length of the rope is 20 meters. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces should equal 20 meters.
   - This gives us the equation: 
     \[

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[

A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on the bond over one year with semi-annual compounding. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Understand the Compounding Periods**: 
   - The bond pays an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. This means the interest is compounded twice a year.

2. **Calculate the Semi-Annual Interest Rate**:
   - The annual interest rate is 12%, so the semi-annual interest rate is half of that: \( \frac{12\%}{2} = 6\% \).

3. **Determine the Number of Compounding Periods**:
   - Since the bond is for one year and interest is compounded semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods in one year.

4. **Use the Compound Interest Formula**:
   - The formula for compound interest is: 
     \[
     A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
     \]
     where:
     - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
     - \( P \) is the principal amount ($5,000).
     - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (0.12).
     - \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (2).
     - \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years (1).

5. **Plug in the Values**:
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}

   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2}

   \[
   A = 5000 \times 1.1236

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618. The correct choice is B) $618.

**Discussion and Verification**:
- Discussing with others or using a calculator can help verify the calculations.
- Visual aids like a timeline can help visualize the compounding periods and the growth of the investment.

   - We need to determine which choice, when multiplied by a two-digit number B E, results in A M I D.

3. **Estimate and test**:
   - Start by estimating the possible values for M A D based on the choices.
   - Calculate the product of M A D with a reasonable two-digit number B E to see if it results in A M I D.

4. **Use logical deduction**:
   - Since M A D is a three-digit number and A M I D is a four-digit number, B E must be a number that, when multiplied by M A D, results in a number close to A M I D.
   - Consider the possible values for B and E that could make the multiplication work.

5. **Trial and error**:
   - Try each choice for M A D and see if you can find a B E that satisfies the equation.
   - Check if the resulting A M I D matches the structure of the multiplication table.

Let's apply this approach to the choices:

- **Choice A: 9 2 0 0**
  - M A D = 920
  - Try different values for B E to see if the multiplication results in a number close to 9200.

- **Choice B: 9 2 0 9**
  - M A D = 9209
  - Again, try different values for B E.

- **Choice C: 9 2 0 1**
  - M A D = 9201
  - Test with different B E values.

- **Choice D: 9 2 0 7**
  - M A D = 9207
  - Test with different B E values.

- **Choice E: 9 2 2 2**
  - M A D = 9222
  - Test with different B E values.

By testing these choices, you can determine which one, when multiplied by a suitable B E, results in a number that matches the structure of A M I D. This process involves some trial and error, but by systematically testing each choice, you can find the correct answer.",False,,,,,
177,,"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years
A)18
B)25
C)15
D)20
E)21",D,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find Ajay's current age. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.
   - 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( S \) be Sachin's current age.
   - Let \( A \) be Ajay's current age.

3. **Translate the information into equations:**
   - Since Sachin will be 40 in 10 years, we can write:
     \[
     S + 10 = 40
     \]
     Solving for \( S \), we get:
     \[
     S = 30
     \]
   - 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago:
     \[
     S - 10 = 2(A - 10)
     \]

4. **Substitute the known value of \( S \):**
   - Substitute \( S = 30 \) into the second equation:
     \[
     30 - 10 = 2(A - 10)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     20 = 2(A - 10)
     \]
     Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     10 = A - 10
     \]
     Add 10 to both sides:
     \[
     A = 20
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - If Ajay is currently 20, then 10 years ago, Ajay was 10.
   - 10 years ago, Sachin was 20 (since he is 30 now).
   - Indeed, 20 is twice 10, which confirms the condition given in the problem.

A)3400
B)1700
C)3440
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot and then determine the cost of gardening that area at the given rate.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres.
   - We need to calculate the cost of gardening a 1-metre wide boundary around this plot.
   - The cost of gardening is 10 per square metre.

2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Plot:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2(l + w)
     \]
     where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
   - Given \( P = 340 \), we have:
     \[
     2(l + w) = 340 \implies l + w = 170
     \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Boundary:**
   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the entire plot.
   - The outer dimensions of the plot including the boundary will be \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \).
   - The area of the plot including the boundary is:
     \[
     (l + 2) \times (w + 2)
     \]
   - The area of the plot itself is:
     \[
     l \times w
     \]
   - The area of the boundary is the difference between these two areas:
     \[
     (l + 2)(w + 2) - lw
     \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Expanding the expression for the area of the plot including the boundary:
     \[
     (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4
     \]
   - The area of the boundary is:
     \[
     (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) - lw = 2l + 2w + 4
     \]
   - Since \( l + w = 170 \), we substitute:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 2 \times 170 = 340
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of the boundary is:
     \[
     340 + 4 = 344
     \]

5. **Calculate the Cost:**
   - The cost of gardening is 10 per square metre.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     344 \times 10 = 3440
     \]

### Conclusion:
The cost of gardening the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot is 3440. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)1.3
B)1.5
C)2.1
D)2.5
E)3.1",B,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use a step-by-step approach. Let's start by defining the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company as \( R \).

1. **Calculate the revenue from novels:**
   - 34% of the total revenue comes from novels.
   - Revenue from novels = \( 0.34R \).

2. **Calculate the remaining revenue after novels:**
   - The remaining revenue after accounting for novels is \( R - 0.34R = 0.66R \).

3. **Calculate the revenue from biographies:**
   - 1/3 of the remaining revenue comes from biographies.
   - Revenue from biographies = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 0.66R = 0.22R \).

4. **Determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies:**
   - We need to find the ratio of the revenue from novels to the revenue from biographies.
   - Ratio = \(\frac{\text{Revenue from novels}}{\text{Revenue from biographies}} = \frac{0.34R}{0.22R} = \frac{0.34}{0.22}\).

D)16000
E)32000",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers the bee flies by in order to bypass 8 flowers, given that it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Understand the Percentage:**
   - The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. This means for every 100 flowers, it bypasses 0.05 flowers.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of flowers the bee flies by.
   - The number of flowers bypassed is 0.05% of \( x \), which can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Bypassed flowers} = \frac{0.05}{100} \times x = 0.0005x
     \]
   - We know the bee bypasses 8 flowers, so:
     \[
     0.0005x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.0005:
     \[
     x = \frac{8}{0.0005}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 16000
     \]

### Conclusion:

The bee flies by 16,000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D) 16000**

### Verification:

- **Estimation Technique:**
  - If the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers, then for every 10,000 flowers, it bypasses 5 flowers (since 0.05% of 10,000 is 5).
  - To bypass 8 flowers, it would need to fly by more than 10,000 flowers.
  - Since 0.05% of 16,000 is 8, this confirms our calculation.

- **Discussion with Others:**
  - Discussing this approach with others might reveal alternative methods, such as using a proportion or a graph to visualize the relationship between the number of flowers flown by and bypassed.

**Constraints:**
1. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so meals can only be allocated from Monday to Friday.
2. Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he cannot use a dinner meal on Friday.

**Lunch Allocation:**
Fernando has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to allocate his 3 lunches. We need to choose 3 days out of these 5 days for lunch. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the combination formula \( nCr \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose.

For lunches, this is:

Fernando has 4 weekdays (Monday to Thursday) to allocate his 3 dinners, since he cannot have dinner on Friday. Again, this is a combination problem.

For dinners, this is:
\[ 4C3 = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

**Total Options:**
The total number of ways Fernando can allocate his meals is the product of the number of ways to allocate lunches and dinners:

1. Recognize that \(a^2 - b^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:

   \[
   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
   \]

2. Substitute this factorization into the expression:

Now, compare this simplified expression \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) with the right-hand side of the original equation, \((a - b)^2\).

Clearly, \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\) is not equal to \((a - b)^2\).

This equation states that the difference between \( x \) and 36 is equal to the difference between 86 and \( x \).

Let's solve the equation step by step:

1. Start with the equation:

2. **Calculate the number of phones in one crate:**
   - Since each pallet holds 1250 phones, the number of phones in one crate is \( 1250 \times p \).

3. **Calculate the total number of phones in 4 crates:**

1. **Determine Individual Work Rates:**
   - A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so A's work rate is \( \frac{1}{40} \) of the wall per minute.
   - B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so B's work rate is \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel. We can break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Understand the problem**: The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means the front of the train takes 3 seconds to travel the length of the train itself. The tunnel is 1 mile long, and the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.

2. **Convert the speed**: Since the speed is given in miles per hour, we should convert it to miles per second to match the time units given in seconds. 
   \[
   \text{Speed in miles per second} = \frac{120 \text{ miles per hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second}

A)247.67
B)237.67
C)227.67
D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the terms of the invoice and how they relate to the interest rate calculation.

### Step 1: Understand the Invoice Terms
The terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean:
- A 4% discount is available if the invoice is paid within 30 days.
- The net amount (full $20,000) is due in 100 days if the discount is not taken.

### Step 2: Calculate the Discount
The discount on the invoice is 4% of $20,000:
\[ \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800 \]

If the merchant pays within 30 days, they only need to pay:
\[ 20,000 - 800 = 19,200 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Effective Interest Rate
The merchant can save $800 by paying $19,200 instead of $20,000. To take advantage of this discount, the merchant might consider borrowing $19,200 for 70 days (the difference between 100 days and 30 days).

The effective interest rate is calculated based on the savings ($800) over the principal ($19,200) for the period of 70 days.

### Step 4: Calculate the Annualized Interest Rate
To find the annualized interest rate, we need to convert the 70-day interest rate to an annual rate. The formula for the simple interest rate is:
\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal}}\right) \times \left(\frac{365}{\text{Days}}\right) \times 100\% \]

Plug in the values:
\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{800}{19,200}\right) \times \left(\frac{365}{70}\right) \times 100\% \]

### Step 5: Perform the Calculation
1. Calculate the fraction of interest to principal:
   \[ \frac{800}{19,200} = 0.04167 \]

2. Calculate the annual factor:
   \[ \frac{365}{70} = 5.2143 \]

3. Calculate the annualized interest rate:
   \[ 0.04167 \times 5.2143 \times 100\% = 217.67\% \]

188,,"There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?
A)90
B)105
C)126
D)252
E)525",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can divide 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 bottles each. This is a classic combinatorics problem where we are choosing 5 bottles out of 10 to form one group, and the remaining bottles automatically form the second group.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Choose 5 bottles for the first group:**
   - The number of ways to choose 5 bottles from 10 is given by the combination formula:
     \[
     \binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
     \]

2. **Form the second group:**
   - Once the first group of 5 bottles is chosen, the remaining 5 bottles automatically form the second group. Therefore, there is no additional calculation needed for the second group.

3. **Consider identical groups:**
   - Since the two groups are indistinguishable (i.e., it doesn't matter which group is labeled as the first or second), we have counted each division twice. Therefore, we need to divide the result by 2 to account for this duplication:
     \[
     \frac{252}{2} = 126
     \]

189,,"A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain?
A)6.5
B)7.5
C)7
D)6
E)None of the above",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of the components in the cereal mixture and how they relate to each other. The given ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Total Parts in the Ratio:**
   The total number of parts in the ratio is the sum of the individual parts: 
   \[
   2 \, (\text{rice}) + 3 \, (\text{wheat}) + 5 \, (\text{corn}) = 10 \, \text{parts}
   \]

2. **Determine the Weight of One Part:**
   We know that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, which corresponds to the 2 parts of rice in the ratio. Therefore, the weight of one part can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of one part} = \frac{3 \, \text{pounds of rice}}{2 \, \text{parts of rice}} = 1.5 \, \text{pounds per part}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Weight of Corn:**
   Since corn corresponds to 5 parts in the ratio, we can calculate the weight of corn by multiplying the weight of one part by the number of parts of corn:
   \[
   \text{Weight of corn} = 5 \, \text{parts of corn} \times 1.5 \, \text{pounds per part} = 7.5 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn. The correct answer is:

190,,"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300

A)500
B)600
C)750
D)800
E)900",E,"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( s \) be the cost of one soda in cents.
- Let \( e \) be the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations based on the given information:

1. \( s + 2e = 150 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2s + 3e = 300 \) (Equation 2)

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

### Step-by-step Solution:

**Step 1: Solve the system of equations**

We can use the method of elimination to solve these equations. First, let's eliminate \( s \) by making the coefficients of \( s \) in both equations equal.

Multiply Equation 1 by 2:

\[ 2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150 \]
\[ 2s + 4e = 300 \]  (Equation 3)

Now, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

\[ (2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300 \]
\[ 4e - 3e = 0 \]
\[ e = 0 \]

This result seems incorrect, indicating a mistake in the elimination process. Let's try another approach.

**Step 2: Solve using substitution**

From Equation 1, express \( s \) in terms of \( e \):

\[ s = 150 - 2e \]

Substitute this expression for \( s \) in Equation 2:

\[ 2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300 \]
\[ 300 - 4e + 3e = 300 \]
\[ 300 - e = 300 \]
\[ -e = 0 \]
\[ e = 0 \]

This result is consistent, but it implies that energy bars are free, which seems unusual. Let's verify by substituting back:

If \( e = 0 \), then from Equation 1:

\[ s + 2(0) = 150 \]
\[ s = 150 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven bars**

Now, calculate \( 6s + 7e \):

\[ 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) \]
\[ = 900 + 0 \]
\[ = 900 \]

Thus, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents.

A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions provided. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Understand the Total Revenue:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue from selling these pens = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

2. **Account for Defective Pens:**
   - On average, 10% of the produced pens are defective.
   - Therefore, 90% of the pens are non-defective and can be sold.
   - If 7200 pens are non-defective, then the total number of pens produced (including defective ones) is:
     \[
     \text{Total pens produced} = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \text{ pens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Manufacturing Cost:**
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.
   - Let the manufacturing cost of each pen be \( x \).
   - Total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens = \( 8000x \).

4. **Relate Profit to Manufacturing Cost:**
   - Profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \( 0.25 \times 8000x = 2000x \).

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total revenue (Rs. 72,000) is the sum of the total manufacturing cost and the profit:
     \[
     8000x + 2000x = 72000
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     10000x = 72000
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{72000}{10000} = 7.2
     \]

Thus, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)12
B)24
C)42
D)48
E)49",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Define the digits:**
   - Let the digit in the ten's place be \( x \).
   - Then the digit in the unit's place is \( 2x \) (since the unit's digit is double the ten's digit).

2. **Form the two-digit number:**
   - The two-digit number can be expressed as \( 10x + 2x = 12x \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the problem statement:**
   - The problem states that the two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.
   - The sum of the digits is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
   - According to the problem, \( 12x = 3x + 18 \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   12x = 3x + 18
   \]
   \[
   12x - 3x = 18
   \]
   \[
   9x = 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

5. **Find the number:**
   - If \( x = 2 \), then the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the number is \( 10 \times 2 + 4 = 24 \).

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - The sum of the digits of 24 is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**
   - The floor function \([x]\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).
   - For example, \([3.7] = 3\) and \([-2.3] = -3\).

2. **Expression for \( L(x, y) \):**
   - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \).
   - This means we take the floor of \( x \), the floor of \( y \), and the floor of their sum.

3. **Expression for \( R(x, y) \):**
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \).
   - This means we take the floor of \( 2x \) and the floor of \( 2y \).

4. **Exploring the Relationship:**
   - We need to determine if there are any conditions under which \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \), \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \), \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \), or \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \).

5. **Breaking Down the Problem:**
   - Consider \( x = a + \epsilon \) and \( y = b + \delta \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, and \( 0 \leq \epsilon, \delta < 1 \).
   - Then, \([x] = a\), \([y] = b\), and \([x + y] = [a + b + \epsilon + \delta]\).
   - If \(\epsilon + \delta < 1\), then \([x + y] = a + b\).
   - If \(\epsilon + \delta \geq 1\), then \([x + y] = a + b + 1\).

6. **Calculating \( R(x, y) \):**
   - \( [2x] = [2a + 2\epsilon] = 2a + [2\epsilon] \).
   - \( [2y] = [2b + 2\delta] = 2b + [2\delta] \).

7. **Comparing \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \):**
   - If \(\epsilon + \delta < 1\), then \( L(x, y) = a + b + a + b = 2a + 2b \).
   - If \(\epsilon + \delta \geq 1\), then \( L(x, y) = a + b + a + b + 1 = 2a + 2b + 1\).
   - \( R(x, y) = 2a + 2b + [2\epsilon] + [2\delta] \).

8. **Finding Conditions:**
   - If \([2\epsilon] + [2\delta] = 0\), then \( R(x, y) = 2a + 2b \).
   - If \([2\epsilon] + [2\delta] = 1\), then \( R(x, y) = 2a + 2b + 1\).
   - If \([2\epsilon] + [2\delta] = 2\), then \( R(x, y) = 2a + 2b + 2\).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - It is impossible for \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \) because the maximum difference between \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \) is 1, and \( L(x, y) \) can be equal to or greater than \( R(x, y) \) depending on the values of \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\).

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 36 = \(2^2 \times 3^2\)
   - 40 = \(2^3 \times 5\)
   - 48 = \(2^4 \times 3\)

2. **Determine the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - \(2^4\) (from 48, as it is the highest power of 2)
   - \(3^2\) (from 36, as it is the highest power of 3)
   - \(5\) (from 40, as it is the only power of 5)

3. **Calculate the LCM:**
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 16 \times 9 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   16 \times 9 = 144

   \[
   144 \times 5 = 720

4. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - 720 seconds = 720 / 60 = 12 minutes

Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

### Conclusion:

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
   - Length of the shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters
   - Length of the shadow of the tree = 15 meters

2. **Set up the proportion:**
   Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow. We can express this as:

   Plugging in the known values:

   \[
   \frac{14}{10} = \frac{\text{Height of the tree}}{15}

The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|

C)120 kmph
D)70 kmph
E)80 kmph",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours and then calculate the gain in speed compared to the original speed.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The car travels at 60 km/hr for 20 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hr = 1200 km.

2. **Determine the Required Speed for 10 Hours:**
   - We need to cover the same distance (1200 km) in 10 hours.
   - Required Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 km / 10 hr = 120 km/hr.

3. **Calculate the Gain in Speed:**
   - Original Speed = 60 km/hr.

E)13/45",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, as Roger's method involves cheating.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Probability of Alan answering correctly:**
   - Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability of Roger answering correctly:**
   - Roger cheats, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - However, since we are looking for the probability of the question being answered correctly without cheating, we will not include Roger's probability in our final calculation.

3. **Probability of Peter answering correctly:**
   - Peter performs calculations, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter (or both), but not by Roger. Since Roger's method involves cheating, we exclude his probability from our calculation.

The probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter is given by the formula for the union of two independent events:

\[
P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = P(\text{Correct by Alan}) + P(\text{Correct by Peter}) - P(\text{Correct by both Alan and Peter})
\]

Since Alan and Peter are independent, the probability that both answer correctly is:

\[
P(\text{Correct by both Alan and Peter}) = P(\text{Correct by Alan}) \times P(\text{Correct by Peter}) = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[
P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6}

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 30:

\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{30}, \quad \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{30}, \quad \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{30}
\]

Substitute these into the equation:

\[
P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} - \frac{5}{30} = \frac{26}{30} = \frac{13}{15}
\]

Thus, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \(\frac{13}{15}\).

However, this result does not match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are considering the correct scenario.

Upon re-evaluation, we realize that the probability of the question being answered correctly without cheating should only consider the individual probabilities of Alan and Peter, without considering the overlap (since the overlap was already considered in the union formula).

Therefore, the correct probability is:

\[
P(\text{Correct by Alan or Peter}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{3}

Convert to a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{30}, \quad \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{30}

Add these probabilities:

\[
\frac{6}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{26}{30} = \frac{13}{15}

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach by defining variables and setting up equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( V \) as the number of files infected by a virus.
- \( W \) as the number of files infected by a worm.
- \( B \) as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- \( W_{\text{only}} \) as the number of files infected only by a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of files is 250.
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, \( W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B \).

We also know:
- The total number of files infected by a worm, \( W \), is the sum of those infected only by a worm and those infected by both a virus and a worm: \( W = W_{\text{only}} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \).

Since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both, we can write:
\[ V + W - B = 250 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 125 + 3.5B - B = 250 \]
\[ 125 + 2.5B = 250 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ 2.5B = 250 - 125 \]
\[ 2.5B = 125 \]
\[ B = \frac{125}{2.5} \]
\[ B = 50 \]

Now, we can find \( W_{\text{only}} \):
\[ W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B = 2.5 \times 50 = 125 \]

Finally, we need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. These are the files infected only by a virus:
\[ \text{Files not infected by a worm} = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is \( \boxed{75} \).",False,,,,,

A)2400
B)2500
C)2600
D)2700
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the share of Mohan such that when both Mohan's and Sohan's shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will have equal amounts when they both reach the age of 26.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Determine the Time Period for Investment:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will reach 26 in 3 years.
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will reach 26 in 2 years.

2. **Set Up the Compound Interest Formula:**
   The compound interest formula is given by:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) years, \( P \) is the principal amount (initial share), \( r \) is the rate of interest, and \( n \) is the number of years.

3. **Equate the Future Values:**
   Since both Mohan and Sohan should have equal amounts at the age of 26, we set up the equation:
   \[
   M \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = S \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2
   \]
   where \( M \) is Mohan's share and \( S \) is Sohan's share.

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   M \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816
   \]
   \[
   \frac{M}{S} = \frac{1.0816}{1.124864}
   \]

5. **Express Sohan's Share in Terms of Mohan's Share:**
   \[
   S = M \times \frac{1.124864}{1.0816}
   \]

6. **Use the Total Amount:**
   The total amount to be divided is Rs. 5100, so:
   \[
   M + S = 5100
   \]
   Substitute \( S \) from the previous step:
   \[
   M + M \times \frac{1.124864}{1.0816} = 5100
   \]
   \[
   M \left(1 + \frac{1.124864}{1.0816}\right) = 5100
   \]

7. **Solve for Mohan's Share:**
   \[
   M \left(1 + 1.039999)\right) = 5100
   \]
   \[
   M \times 2.039999 = 5100
   \]
   \[
   M = \frac{5100}{2.039999} \approx 2500

A)450 gms
B)100 gms
C)252 gms
D)240 gms
E)None of these",C,"To solve the problem of finding 60% of 30% of 1400 grams, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps:

1. **Calculate 30% of 1400 grams:**
   - 30% can be expressed as a decimal: 0.30.
   - Multiply 1400 grams by 0.30 to find 30% of 1400 grams:
     \[
     1400 \times 0.30 = 420 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Calculate 60% of the result from step 1 (420 grams):**
   - 60% can be expressed as a decimal: 0.60.
   - Multiply 420 grams by 0.60 to find 60% of 420 grams:
     \[
     420 \times 0.60 = 252 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is 252 grams.

The correct answer is **C) 252 gms**.

To ensure understanding, let's visualize the process:

- **Visual Aid:**
  - Imagine a bar representing 1400 grams.
  - First, divide this bar into 10 equal parts to represent 10% each.
  - Take 3 parts (30%) of this bar, which equals 420 grams.
  - Now, take 6 parts (60%) of the 420 grams section, which equals 252 grams.

- **Estimation Technique:**
  - Roughly estimate 30% of 1400 grams as a bit less than half (since 50% is 700 grams), which is 420 grams.
  - Then, estimate 60% of 420 grams as a bit more than half (since 50% is 210 grams), which is 252 grams.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the rate of flow:**
   - The rate of flow is given as \( \frac{w}{25} \) gallons per \( x \) seconds.
   - To find the rate in gallons per second, divide the gallons by the time in seconds:
     \[
     \text{Rate in gallons per second} = \frac{w}{25x}
     \]

2. **Convert the rate to gallons per minute:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, so multiply the rate in gallons per second by 60 to convert it to gallons per minute:
     \[
     \text{Rate in gallons per minute} = \frac{w}{25x} \times 60 = \frac{60w}{25x} = \frac{12w}{5x}
     \]

3. **Determine the time to pass \( y \) gallons:**
   - We need to find out how many minutes it will take for \( y \) gallons to pass through the drain at the rate of \( \frac{12w}{5x} \) gallons per minute.
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total gallons}}{\text{Rate in gallons per minute}}\):
     \[
     \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{y}{\frac{12w}{5x}} = y \times \frac{5x}{12w} = \frac{5xy}{12w}

205,,"A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and use the given information effectively.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Original Coin

The original coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or thickness in this case).

- Radius \( r = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm
- Height \( h = 2 \) mm

\[ V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 \]
\[ V = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 \]
\[ V = 112.5\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \]

### Step 2: Determine the Volume of Aluminum and Silver

The problem states that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Therefore, each metal occupies half of the total volume:

\[ V_{\text{Al}} = V_{\text{Ag}} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \]

### Step 3: Determine the Densities

The weight of the original coin is 30 grams. Let \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \) be the density of aluminum and \( \rho_{\text{Ag}} \) be the density of silver. We know:

- The total weight is 30 grams.
- Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so \( \rho_{\text{Ag}} = 2\rho_{\text{Al}} \).

The total weight equation is:

\[ \rho_{\text{Al}} \times V_{\text{Al}} + \rho_{\text{Ag}} \times V_{\text{Ag}} = 30 \]

Substituting the volumes and the relationship between densities:

\[ \rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]

\[ 3\rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]

\[ \rho_{\text{Al}} = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Weight of the New Coin

The new coin is made of pure aluminum and measures 1 mm in thickness and 30 mm in diameter. Its volume is:

- Radius \( r = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm
- Height \( h = 1 \) mm

\[ V_{\text{new}} = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 \]
\[ V_{\text{new}} = 225\pi \, \text{mm}^3 \]

The weight of the new coin is:

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \rho_{\text{Al}} \times V_{\text{new}} \]

Substitute \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \) from above:

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} \times 225\pi \]

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{30 \times 225\pi}{3 \times 56.25\pi} \]

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{30 \times 225}{3 \times 56.25} \]

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{30 \times 225}{168.75} \]

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \frac{6750}{168.75} \]

\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = 40 \, \text{grams} \]

Thus, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams. The correct answer is:

1. **Define the variable:**
   Let \( x \) be the number we are trying to find.

2. **Translate the problem into an equation:**
   According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. This can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
   \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - First, let's eliminate the fractions by multiplying every term by 3 to make the equation easier to handle:
     \[
     3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2x - 30 = 120 + x
     \]

   - Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     2x - x - 30 = 120
     \]
     \[
     x - 30 = 120
     \]

   - Add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - Calculate 2/3 of 150: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100\)
   - Subtract 10 from 100: \(100 - 10 = 90\)
   - Calculate 1/3 of 150: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50\)
   - Add 40 to 50: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

   Both sides of the equation equal 90, confirming that our solution is correct.

   The number is 150, which corresponds to choice C.

E)12",C,"To determine the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \) has two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0

In the given equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = k \). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k

We need this to be greater than zero for the roots to be real and distinct:

\[
25 - 4k > 0

Solving this inequality for \( k \):

\[
25 > 4k

\[

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots is 6.

However, the choices provided do not include 6. Let's verify the choices to ensure we didn't overlook anything:

- If \( k = 9 \), then \( 25 - 4 \times 9 = 25 - 36 = -11 \), which is not greater than zero.
- If \( k = 7 \), then \( 25 - 4 \times 7 = 25 - 28 = -3 \), which is not greater than zero.
- If \( k = 3 \), then \( 25 - 4 \times 3 = 25 - 12 = 13 \), which is greater than zero.
- If \( k = 8 \), then \( 25 - 4 \times 8 = 25 - 32 = -7 \), which is not greater than zero.
- If \( k = 12 \), then \( 25 - 4 \times 12 = 25 - 48 = -23 \), which is not greater than zero.

   - Time to ride 15 km = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours.

2. **Determine the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - 100 km divided by 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   T + C = 17

2. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that traveling both ways by train takes 4 hours more than the round trip by train and car. Therefore:
   \[
   2T = 17 + 4 = 21

Now that we have \( T = 10.5 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
T + C = 17 \implies 10.5 + C = 17 \implies C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5

D)35%
E)40%",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts by calculating the amount of food remaining after each feeding session.

1. **Initial Amount of Food:**
   Let's assume the initial amount of food in the bowl is 1 unit (or 100%).

2. **First Feeding (8:00 am):**
   The dog eats 1/3 of the food, so 2/3 of the food remains.
   - Remaining food = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \)

3. **Second Feeding (9:00 am):**
   The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, so 2/3 of the remaining food stays.
   - Remaining food = \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9} \)

4. **Third Feeding (10:00 am):**
   The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, so 2/3 of the remaining food stays.
   - Remaining food = \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{8}{27} \)

5. **Fourth Feeding (11:00 am):**
   The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, so 2/3 of the remaining food stays.
   - Remaining food = \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{8}{27} = \frac{16}{81} \)

Now, we need to find out what percent of the original food is left right before the dog begins to eat at noon.

6. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - Remaining food as a percentage = \( \frac{16}{81} \times 100\% \approx 19.75\% \)

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of people who took the survey.
   - Since 60% of the people surveyed were women, the number of women is \( 0.6T \).
   - Therefore, the number of men is \( 0.4T \).

2. **Information about Men's Preferences:**
   - We know that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars.

A)88
B)89
C)90
D)91
E)92",B,"To solve this problem, we can use a method similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to determine the number of ways the boy can reach each step, building up to the 10th step.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If there are 0 steps, there is 1 way to be at the start (doing nothing).
   - If there is 1 step, there is 1 way to reach it (one single step).

2. **Recursive Relation:**
   - For any step \( n \), the boy can reach it either from step \( n-1 \) (by taking a single step) or from step \( n-2 \) (by taking two steps).
   - Therefore, the number of ways to reach step \( n \) is the sum of the ways to reach step \( n-1 \) and step \( n-2 \).

3. **Formulate the Sequence:**
   - Let \( f(n) \) be the number of ways to reach the \( n \)-th step.
   - The relation is: \( f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \).

4. **Calculate for Each Step:**
   - \( f(0) = 1 \)
   - \( f(1) = 1 \)
   - \( f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - \( f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
   - \( f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - \( f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
   - \( f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
   - \( f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
   - \( f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \)
   - \( f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 \)

Thus, the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs with 10 steps is \( f(10) = 89 \).

A)0.5
B)1
C)1.25
D)1.5
E)2",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use a bit of algebra to find the solution. Let's start by understanding the initial composition of the soft drink and what we want to achieve.

1. **Initial Composition:**
   - We have 1 gallon of soft drink.
   - 40% of this gallon is orange juice, which means we have 0.4 gallons of orange juice.
   - 60% of this gallon is water, which means we have 0.6 gallons of water.

2. **Desired Composition:**
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional gallons of orange juice we need to add.
   - After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice will be \( 0.4 + x \) gallons.
   - The total volume of the mixture will be \( 1 + x \) gallons (since we are adding only orange juice).

4. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture:
     \[
     \frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
     \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
     \]
   - Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
     \[
     0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
     \]
     \[
     0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
     \]
   - Subtract 0.4 from both sides:
     \[
     0.4x = 0.2
     \]
   - Divide by 0.4 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5

1. **Calculate \(9^3\):**
   - First, find the units digit of \(9^3\).
   - The units digit of a number is determined by the units digit of its base raised to the power.
   - Let's calculate the units digit of \(9^3\):
     - \(9^1 = 9\) (units digit is 9)

D)4/5
E)6/5",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he randomly selects two horses out of the five in the race.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Total Number of Ways to Select Two Horses:**
   The total number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), where \(n\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \(k\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, it is \(\binom{5}{2}\).

   \[
   \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

2. **Number of Favorable Outcomes:**
   For Mr. Jain to have selected the winning horse, the winning horse must be one of the two horses he selects. There are 5 possible winning horses, and for each winning horse, there are 4 other horses that can be paired with it. Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is 5 (one for each horse being the winner).

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

However, this result doesn't match any of the given choices. Let's reconsider the problem:

- If Mr. Jain selects two horses, and we want at least one of them to be the winner, we can think of it as the complement of selecting two horses that are both not winners. If there is only one winner, then selecting two horses that are not winners is impossible, as one of the two selected must be the winner.

Thus, the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is actually the probability that at least one of the two selected horses is the winner. Since there is only one winner, and he selects two horses, the probability is indeed:

     P_{\text{after retailer}} = P_{\text{after manufacturer}} \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P \times 0.80 = 0.64P
     \]

3. **Total Discount Calculation:**
   - The final price after both discounts is \( 0.64P \).
   - The total discount is the difference between the original price and the final price:
     \[
     \text{Total Discount} = P - 0.64P = 0.36P
     \]
   - The total discount as a percentage of the original price is:
     \[
     \frac{0.36P}{P} \times 100\% = 36\%
     \]

Therefore, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

The correct answer is **E) 36%**.

To visualize this, you could draw a diagram showing the price reductions at each step, or use a graph to illustrate how the price decreases with each successive discount. Discussing this with others might also reveal that successive percentage discounts multiply rather than add, which is a common point of confusion.",True,,,,,

A)46
B)81
C)126
D)252
E)None",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular parking space and then calculate its area.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with three sides painted and one side unpainted.
   - The unpainted side is 9 feet long.
   - The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet.

2. **Identify the Sides:**
   - Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \) and the width as \( W \).
   - Assume the unpainted side is the width, \( W = 9 \) feet.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The painted sides include two lengths and one width.
   - Therefore, the equation for the painted sides is: \( L + L + W = 37 \).
   - Substitute \( W = 9 \) into the equation: \( 2L + 9 = 37 \).

C)2
D)3
E)4",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways Peter can choose 10 additional people from his 10 friends to form a team. This is a combinatorial problem where we are choosing a subset of a set.

Peter wants to form a team of 11 people, including himself. Since he already has 10 friends who want to participate, he needs to choose all 10 of them to form the team. This means he has no choice but to include all 10 friends.

Let's break it down:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Peter is one person, and he needs 10 more people to form a team of 11. He has exactly 10 friends available.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The number of ways to choose 10 people from a group of 10 is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}

   where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose.

3. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 10 \).
   \[
   \binom{10}{10} = \frac{10!}{10! \times (10-10)!} = \frac{10!}{10! \times 0!} = \frac{10!}{10! \times 1} = 1

1. **Understand the problem**: We have 10 oarsmen, and the average weight of these oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one oarsman (weighing 53 kg) is replaced by a new man. We need to find the weight of the new man.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - Let the total weight of the original 10 oarsmen be \( W \).
   - The average weight of the original 10 oarsmen is \( \frac{W}{10} \).

3. **Calculate the new average**:
   - When the 53 kg oarsman is replaced, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg.
   - The new average weight is \( \frac{W}{10} + 1.8 \).

4. **Express the new total weight**:
   - The new total weight of the 10 oarsmen is \( W - 53 + \text{weight of the new man} \).
   - The new average weight is also equal to \( \frac{W - 53 + \text{weight of the new man}}{10} \).

5. **Set up the equation for the new average**:

A)11
B)10
C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given and how they relate to combinations.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a box with balls numbered from 1 to n.
   - We need to select 2 balls such that the ball numbered 3 is not selected.
   - There are 45 different ways to do this.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem:**
   - If the ball numbered 3 is not selected, we are essentially choosing 2 balls from the remaining \( n-1 \) balls (since ball 3 is excluded).
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n-1 \) balls is given by the combination formula: 
     \[
     \binom{n-1}{2} = 45

   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-88) = 9 + 352 = 361
     \]
   - Since 361 is a perfect square (\( \sqrt{361} = 19 \)), the roots are integers.
   - Calculate the roots:
     \[
     n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only
E)I and III only",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of factors of a number and its prime factorization.

1. **Understanding the Number of Factors:**
   - If a number \( Q \) has a prime factorization of \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), the total number of factors of \( Q \) is given by \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \).
   - We are given that \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors. Therefore, the product of the terms \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \) must equal 5.

2. **Analyzing the Possibilities:**
   - Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \). This implies that one of the exponents \( a_i \) must be 4, and all other exponents must be 0.
   - Therefore, \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

3. **Evaluating the Statements:**
   - **Statement I: Q is the square of a prime number.**
     - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which is not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.
   - **Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number.**
     - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This matches our requirement. Therefore, this statement is true.
   - **Statement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers.**
     - If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), which is not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.

2. **With Membership:**
   - Membership cost = $7.00 per month

\binom{3}{2} \times \binom{4}{1} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

#### Case 3: Total Cost = $2.50
- Select 1 candy bar from the 50-cent group and 2 from the $1 group.
\[
\binom{3}{1} \times \binom{4}{2} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

#### Case 4: Total Cost = $3
- Select all 3 candy bars from the $1 group.
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

#### Case 5: Total Cost = $3.50
- Select 1 candy bar from the 50-cent group, 1 from the $1 group, and 1 from the $2 group.
\[
\binom{3}{1} \times \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{1} = 3 \times 4 \times 4 = 48
\]

#### Case 6: Total Cost = $4
- Select 2 candy bars from the $1 group and 1 from the $2 group.
\[
\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{1} = 6 \times 4 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Combinations with Cost ≤ $4
Add up all the combinations from the cases above:
\[
1 + 12 + 18 + 4 + 48 + 24 = 107
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Combinations with Total Cost > $4
Subtract the number of combinations with a total cost of $4 or less from the total number of combinations:
\[
165 - 107 = 58
\]

However, it seems there was a miscalculation in the cases. Let's re-evaluate the cases where the total cost is more than $4:

### Correct Calculation for Total Cost > $4
- **Case 1**: 3 candy bars costing $2 each (total $6)
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} = 4
  \]

- **Case 2**: 2 candy bars costing $2 each and 1 candy bar costing $1 (total $5)
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{1} = 6 \times 4 = 24
  \]

- **Case 3**: 2 candy bars costing $2 each and 1 candy bar costing 50 cents (total $4.50)
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{3}{1} = 6 \times 3 = 18
  \]

- **Case 4**: 1 candy bar costing $2, 2 candy bars costing $1 each (total $4)
  \[
  \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{2} = 4 \times 6 = 24
  \]

Adding these up gives:
\[
4 + 24 + 18 + 24 = 70
\]

Thus, the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is \(\boxed{70}\).",False,,,,,
237,,"At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
A)120
B)19
C)180
D)420
E)460",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Total Ways to Choose 4 Presenters:**
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people (4 men and 4 women) is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items without regard to order.
   - \(\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70\).

2. **Subtract Groups Composed Only of Men or Only of Women:**
   - The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 men is \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).
   - The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 women is \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).

3. **Calculate Valid Groups:**
   - The number of valid groups (not all men or all women) is the total number of groups minus the all-men and all-women groups.
   - Valid groups = Total groups - All-men groups - All-women groups
   - Valid groups = 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

4. **Verify by Considering Mixed Groups:**
   - We can also verify by considering the possible mixed groups:
     - 3 men and 1 woman: \(\binom{4}{3} \times \binom{4}{1} = 4 \times 4 = 16\).
     - 2 men and 2 women: \(\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 6 \times 6 = 36\).
     - 1 man and 3 women: \(\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{3} = 4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - Total mixed groups = 16 + 36 + 16 = 68.

Thus, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen, ensuring that the group is not composed entirely of men or entirely of women, is 68.

However, it seems there is a discrepancy with the provided choices. Let's re-evaluate the choices:

238,,"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
A)50
B)100
C)150
D)200
E)70",C,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use a bit of algebra to find the solution.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We know that 2/5 of the children in the class are girls.
   - We also know there are 100 boys in the class.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of girls in the class.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of boys in the class, which is given as 100.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of children in the class.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since 2/5 of the total number of children are girls, we can express this as:
     \[
     G = \frac{2}{5}T
     \]
   - The total number of children is the sum of boys and girls:
     \[
     T = B + G
     \]
   - Substitute the known value of boys:
     \[
     T = 100 + G
     \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( T = 100 + G \) into the equation \( G = \frac{2}{5}T \):
     \[
     G = \frac{2}{5}(100 + G)
     \]
   - Distribute the fraction:
     \[
     G = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 + \frac{2}{5} \times G
     \]
     \[
     G = 40 + \frac{2}{5}G
     \]
   - To isolate \( G \), subtract \(\frac{2}{5}G\) from both sides:
     \[
     G - \frac{2}{5}G = 40
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5}G = 40
     \]
   - Solve for \( G \) by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{5}{3}\):
     \[
     G = 40 \times \frac{5}{3}
     \]
     \[
     G = \frac{200}{3}
     \]
     \[
     G = 40 \times \frac{5}{3} = 66.67
     \]

5. **Check the Answer:**
   - Since the number of girls must be a whole number, let's re-evaluate the calculation. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again:
   - From the equation \(\frac{3}{5}G = 40\), multiply both sides by \(\frac{5}{3}\):
     \[
     G = 40 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{200}{3} = 66.67

A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000\} \) is relatively prime to 1000. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1000
First, let's find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3 \]

### Step 2: Use Euler's Totient Function
Euler's Totient Function, \(\phi(n)\), gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right) \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) \]

Calculating this:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 400 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
The number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000 is 400. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is:
\[ \frac{\phi(1000)}{1000} = \frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

A)$45,000
B)$50,000

E)$62,000",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money Charles invested, given that he received $54,080 after one year with an 8% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Compounding Formula:**
   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
   - \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
   - \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - \( A = 54,080 \)
   - \( r = 0.08 \) (8% as a decimal)
   - \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually)
   - \( t = 1 \) year

3. **Plug the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   54,080 = P \times 1.04^2
   \]
   \[
   54,080 = P \times 1.0816
   \]

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816}
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 50,000
   \]

5. **Verify with the Choices:**
   The calculated principal \( P \approx 50,000 \) matches choice B.

A)45
B)48
C)50
D)55
E)58",C,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( J \) be Joe's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Joe's sister's current age.
- Let \( F \) be Joe's father's current age.

We are given the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 100:
   \[
   J + S + F = 100
   \]

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This implies that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age:
   \[
   F - J = 2S - S = S
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   F - J = S
   \]

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This implies:
   - The time it takes for Joe to reach his father's current age is \( F - J \).
   - At that time, Joe's father will be \( F + (F - J) = 2F - J \).
   - The time it takes for Joe's sister to reach her father's current age is \( F - S \).
   - At that time, Joe's father was \( F - (F - S) = S \).

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   2F - J = 2S
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( J + S + F = 100 \)
2. \( F - J = S \)
3. \( 2F - J = 2S \)

Let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation 2, we have:
\[
F = J + S
\]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation 1:
\[
J + S + (J + S) = 100
\]
\[
2J + 2S = 100
\]
\[
J + S = 50
\]

Now, substitute \( J + S = 50 \) into equation 2:
\[
F = 50
\]

Finally, let's verify with equation 3:
Substitute \( F = 50 \) and \( J + S = 50 \) into equation 3:
\[
2(50) - J = 2S
\]
\[
100 - J = 2S
\]

Since \( J + S = 50 \), we have \( S = 50 - J \). Substitute this into the equation:
\[
100 - J = 2(50 - J)
\]
\[
100 - J = 100 - 2J
\]
\[
J = 2J
\]
\[
J = 0
\]

This is not possible, so let's re-evaluate the steps. We need to ensure the equations are consistent. Let's try another approach:

From equation 2, \( F - J = S \), substitute into equation 1:
\[
J + (F - J) + F = 100
\]
\[
F = 50

Thus, the age of Joe's father is \( \boxed{50} \).",False,,,,,

1. **Understanding the given condition:**
   - We are given that \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \).
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y

   - For breakfast, the man has 6 different types of fruit to choose from.
   - For dinner, he has 8 different types of vegetables to choose from.

2. **Calculate the total number of combinations:**
   - Since the choice of fruit for breakfast is independent of the choice of vegetable for dinner, we can multiply the number of choices for breakfast by the number of choices for dinner.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways he can choose one fruit and one vegetable is:

D)59.0%
E)65.6%",E,"To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is used to find the probability of having exactly \( k \) successes in \( n \) independent Bernoulli trials, each with a probability of success \( p \). The formula is:

\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 voters),
- \( k \) is the number of successes we are interested in (in this case, 4 voters who voted),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.9, since there is a 90% chance a voter voted),

Let's calculate the probability:

1. **Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):**

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular yard with one side unfenced.
   - The unfenced side is 10 meters long.
   - The area of the yard is 240 square meters.

2. **Determine the Dimensions:**
   - Let the length of the unfenced side be \( L = 10 \) meters.
   - Let the width of the yard be \( W \).
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[

1. **Identify the positions and their constraints:**
   - The first letter must be a consonant.
   - The middle letter must be a vowel.
   - The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter.

2. **Calculate the possibilities for each position:**
   - **Middle letter (vowel):** There are 5 vowels available. So, there are 5 choices for the middle letter.
   - **First letter (consonant):** There are 20 consonants available. So, there are 20 choices for the first letter.
   - **Third letter (consonant):** The third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter. Therefore, there are 19 choices for the third letter (since it cannot be the same as the first letter).

3. **Calculate the total number of codes:**

B)38
C)36
D)30
E)39",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use estimation techniques to simplify the calculation.

### Step 1: Calculate the Sum
First, calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:

\[ 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184 \]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The product of these integers is given by:

\[ (n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = 2184 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Product
The expression for the product can be simplified using the identity for the product of three consecutive numbers:

\[ (n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n \]

So, we have:

\[ n^3 - n = 2184 \]

### Step 4: Estimate \( n \)
To find an approximate value for \( n \), we can estimate by taking the cube root of 2184. Since \( n^3 \approx 2184 \), we can start by estimating:

\[ n \approx \sqrt[3]{2184} \]

Using estimation, we know that \( 12^3 = 1728 \) and \( 13^3 = 2197 \). Since 2184 is closer to 2197, we can estimate \( n \approx 13 \).

### Step 5: Verify the Estimate
Let's verify by calculating the product of the consecutive integers 12, 13, and 14:

\[ 12 \times 13 \times 14 = 2184 \]

This confirms that the integers are indeed 12, 13, and 14.

### Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the Integers

D)120000 litres
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the tank and then convert that volume into liters.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Tank

The tank is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the tank:
- Length = 8 meters
- Width = 6 meters
- Height = 2.5 meters

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} \times 2.5 \, \text{m} \]

\[ V = 48 \, \text{m}^2 \times 2.5 \, \text{m} \]

\[ V = 120 \, \text{m}^3 \]

### Step 2: Convert Cubic Meters to Liters

1 cubic meter is equivalent to 1,000 liters. Therefore, to convert cubic meters to liters, we multiply by 1,000:

\[ V = 120 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1,000 \, \text{liters/m}^3 \]

\[ V = 120,000 \, \text{liters} \]

### Conclusion

The capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters. Therefore, the correct choice is:

**D) 120,000 liters**

### Additional Methods

- **Estimation**: Before calculating, you could estimate by recognizing that each dimension is a whole number and relatively large, suggesting a large volume. This can help you anticipate a large number of liters.

1. **Identify the Total Population and Adult Population:**
   - Total population of the city = 5,265,526
   - Adult population in the city = 4,169,516

2. **Calculate the Number of Children:**
   - Number of children = Total population - Adult population
   - Number of children = 5,265,526 - 4,169,516

3. **Perform the Subtraction:**
   - Start from the rightmost digit and subtract each corresponding digit:
     - 6 - 6 = 0
     - 2 - 1 = 1
     - 5 - 5 = 0
     - 6 - 9: Since 6 is less than 9, borrow 1 from the next left digit (2 becomes 1, and 6 becomes 16), so 16 - 9 = 7
     - 1 - 1 = 0
     - 5 - 4 = 1

   Therefore, the number of children in the city is 1,095,010.

4. **Check Against the Given Choices:**
   - The calculated number of children, 1,095,010, does not match any of the provided choices. This suggests there might be a mistake in the subtraction process or the choices provided.

5. **Re-evaluate the Calculation:**
   - Let's recheck the subtraction:
     - 5,265,526

     - Subtracting these gives: 1,095,010

   It seems there was a mistake in the initial calculation or the choices provided. Let's try a different approach to ensure accuracy.

6. **Estimation Technique:**
   - Round the numbers to make the calculation easier:
     - Total population ≈ 5,300,000
     - Adult population ≈ 4,200,000
     - Estimated number of children ≈ 5,300,000 - 4,200,000 = 1,100,000

   This estimation suggests the number of children should be close to 1,100,000, which aligns more closely with choice A (1,095,961).

7. **Final Verification:**
   - Recalculate using the exact numbers:
     - 5,265,526 - 4,169,516 = 1,095,010

   Upon further review, it seems the initial calculation was correct, but the choices provided might have a typographical error. The closest choice to our calculated result is A) 1,095,961, which is likely intended to be the correct answer.

1. **Calculate the distance when driving:**
   - Speed while driving = 20 km/h
   - Time while driving = 9 minutes

   Since the time is given in minutes, we need to convert it to hours because the speed is in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

   \[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{9 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 0.15 \text{ hours} \]

   Now, calculate the distance:

   \[ \text{Distance} = 20 \text{ km/h} \times 0.15 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ kilometers} \]

2. **Calculate the time when cycling:**
   - Speed while cycling = 6 km/h
   - Distance = 3 kilometers (as calculated above)

   We need to find the time it takes to cycle this distance. Using the formula for time:

   \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ km}}{6 \text{ km/h}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

First, let's break down the rates at which P and Q eat the candies:

1. **P's Rate:**
   - P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, P's rate is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the jar per minute.

2. **Q's Rate:**
   - Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.
   - Therefore, Q's rate is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of half the jar per minute, which is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the entire jar per minute.

Now, let's calculate their combined rate:

- Combined rate = P's rate + Q's rate
- Combined rate = \( \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \) of the jar per minute.

This means that together, P and Q can eat \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the jar in one minute.

To find out how long it takes them to finish the entire jar, we need to determine how many minutes it takes to eat 1 whole jar at this combined rate:
