The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Setting Up the Problem:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 45° be \( x_1 \).
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 60° be \( x_2 \).

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Finding the Speed of the Car:**
   - The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance traveled in 10 minutes is:
     \[
     x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]
   - The speed of the car is:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
     \]

5. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \).
   - The time \( t \) to cover this distance at the same speed is:
     \[
     t = \frac{x_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

6. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:
     \[
     t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = 10 \cdot (3 + \sqrt{3}) = 30 + 10\sqrt{3}
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 10(\sqrt{3} + 3) \).
   - This does not match any of the given choices exactly, so the answer is:
     \[
     \boxed{\text{E) None of these}}

   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = 10 \cdot (3 + \sqrt{3}) = 10 \cdot (2 + \sqrt{3})

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"COT: To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   After applying the $20-off coupon, the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Relate this to half the original price:**
   According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8

   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8

   Divide by 0.56:
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} = 78.2142857

A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given values is a multiple of \( X \), where \( X \) is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12, as this will give us the smallest number that is divisible by both.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 9 can be factored into \( 3^2 \).
   - 12 can be factored into \( 2^2 \times 3 \).

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.
   - The highest power of 2 is \( 2^2 \).
   - The highest power of 3 is \( 3^2 \).

   Therefore, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36 \).

Now, we know that \( X = 36 \). We need to find which of the given choices is a multiple of 36.

Let's evaluate each choice:

- **A) 36**: 36 is a multiple of 36 (since 36 divided by 36 equals 1).
- **B) 15**: 15 is not a multiple of 36 (since 15 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **C) 17**: 17 is not a multiple of 36 (since 17 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **D) 5**: 5 is not a multiple of 36 (since 5 divided by 36 is not an integer).
- **E) 7**: 7 is not a multiple of 36 (since 7 divided by 36 is not an integer).

The only value that is a multiple of 36 is choice A) 36.

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

1. **Identify the probabilities:**
   - Probability that Stock A will increase: \( P(A) = 0.56 \)
   - Probability that Stock B will increase: \( P(B) = 0.74 \)

2. **Calculate the probability that each stock will not increase:**
   - Probability that Stock A will not increase: \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \)
   - Probability that Stock B will not increase: \( P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \)

3. **Determine the greatest probability that neither stock will increase:**
   - The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is given by the probability of the intersection of the two events \( A' \) and \( B' \), which is \( P(A' \cap B') \).
   - The greatest value for \( P(A' \cap B') \) occurs when the events \( A' \) and \( B' \) are independent. In this case, the probability is the product of the individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \times P(B') = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
     \]

4. **Check the answer choices:**
   - The calculated probability \( 0.1144 \) is not among the given choices. This suggests that the problem might be asking for the greatest possible probability under different assumptions, such as dependence between the events.

5. **Consider the possibility of dependence:**
   - If the events are dependent, the greatest probability that neither event occurs is simply the probability of the less likely event not occurring, which is \( P(B') = 0.26 \).

Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is \( \boxed{0.26} \), which corresponds to choice B.

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"COT: To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit percentage:

\[
\text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 360
- Profit Percentage = 20%

We need to find the Cost Price (CP).

First, express the profit percentage formula in terms of CP:

\[
20 = \left( \frac{360 - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
0.2 = \frac{360 - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}}
\]

Multiply both sides by CP to eliminate the fraction:

\[
0.2 \times \text{CP} = 360 - \text{CP}
\]

Rearrange the equation:

\[
0.2 \times \text{CP} + \text{CP} = 360
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
1.2 \times \text{CP} = 360
\]

Solve for CP by dividing both sides by 1.2:

\[
\text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.2} = 300

D)400
E)3200",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initially, all marbles in the bag are white.
   - 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and returned to the bag. So, there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. **Second Pull:**
   - Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black.
   - The percentage of black marbles in this sample is \(\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

3. **Percentage Representation:**
   - The problem states that this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.
   - Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.

4. **Calculate Total Marbles:**
   - Let \( Q \) be the total number of marbles in the bag.
   - Since 5% of the marbles are black, we have:
     \[
     \frac{20}{Q} \times 100 = 5

   - Solving for \( Q \):
     \[
     \frac{20}{Q} = 0.05

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who did not attend either the prom night or the debating session. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this.

1. **Calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom night:**

   Since at least 45% of the 200 students attended the prom night, we have:
   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]
   So, at least 90 students attended the prom night.

2. **Calculate the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session:**

   Since at least 35% of the 200 students took part in the debating session, we have:
   \[
   0.35 \times 200 = 70
   \]
   So, at least 70 students took part in the debating session.

3. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**

   Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night, and \( D \) be the set of students who took part in the debating session. We want to find the maximum number of students who are in neither \( P \) nor \( D \).

   The principle of inclusion-exclusion gives us:
   \[
   |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D|
   \]

   We want to maximize the number of students who are in neither \( P \) nor \( D \), which is:
   \[
   200 - |P \cup D|
   \]

   To maximize \( 200 - |P \cup D| \), we need to minimize \( |P \cup D| \). The minimum value of \( |P \cup D| \) occurs when the overlap \( |P \cap D| \) is maximized.

4. **Calculate the maximum overlap:**

   The maximum overlap \( |P \cap D| \) occurs when all students in the smaller group (debating session) are also in the larger group (prom night). Therefore, the maximum overlap is 70.

5. **Calculate the minimum value of \( |P \cup D| \):**

   \[
   |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
   \]

6. **Calculate the maximum number of students who attended neither:**

   \[
   200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 90 = 110

C)25
D)40
E)52",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sales of $250 each are required for the salesperson to earn at least $1000 in commission.

1. **Calculate the commission per sale:**
   - The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale.
   - For a sale of $250, the commission is \( 10\% \times 250 = 0.10 \times 250 = 25 \) dollars per sale.

2. **Determine the number of sales needed to reach $1000:**
   - We need to find the number of sales, \( n \), such that the total commission is at least $1000.
   - The equation for the total commission is: \( 25n \geq 1000 \).

3. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - Divide both sides of the inequality by 25 to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n \geq \frac{1000}{25} = 40

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
A)226
B)230
C)240
D)260
E)280",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400.

1. **Calculate the Total Yearly Production Cost:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Therefore, the monthly production cost is \( 420 \times 110 = 46,200 \) dollars.
   - The yearly production cost is \( 46,200 \times 12 = 554,400 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the Required Yearly Revenue:**
   - The company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue - Production Cost.
   - Therefore, the required yearly revenue is \( 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,080,800 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Selling Price per Component:**
   - The company sells 420 units each month, so in a year, it sells \( 420 \times 12 = 5,040 \) units.
   - To find the minimum selling price per component, divide the required yearly revenue by the total number of units sold in a year:
   \[
   \text{Minimum Selling Price} = \frac{1,080,800}{5,040} \approx 214.29
   \]

4. **Choose the Minimum Selling Price from the Given Options:**
   - The minimum selling price per component must be at least $214.29.
   - Among the given choices, the smallest price that is greater than or equal to $214.29 is $226.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit is at least $626,400 is \(\boxed{226}\).

C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).

3. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

4. **Mistakenly Rejected Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of mistakenly rejected staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

5. **Given Information:**
   - We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we set up the equation:
     \[
     0.018x = 72

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

1. **Determine the rate of production for each machine:**
   - Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
   - Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of production:**
   - The combined rate of production is the sum of the individual rates:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ yo-yos per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine how long it takes to produce 10 yo-yos:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time in minutes it takes to produce 10 yo-yos. Using the combined rate, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{5}{18} \times t = 10

A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Scenario 1**: You walk 20 steps and stop, and it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
2. **Scenario 2**: You walk 10 steps and stop, and it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom.

Let's define:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps of the staircase.

### Scenario 1:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

The equation for Scenario 1 is:
\[ S - 20 = 10v \]

### Scenario 2:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

The equation for Scenario 2 is:
\[ S - 10 = 20v \]

### Solving the Equations:
We have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v \]
\[ 10 = 10v \]
\[ v = 1 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6
\]

First, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
13 \times 13 = 169
\]

\[
169 - 156 = 13
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6
\]

Next, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
5 - 15 - 7 = -17
\]

So, the equation is now:

\[
\frac{? \times 19 - 17}{13} = 6

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 13:

\[
? \times 19 - 17 = 6 \times 13
\]

\[
? \times 19 - 17 = 78
\]

Add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the question mark:

\[
? \times 19 = 78 + 17

\[
? \times 19 = 95

E)40",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

1. **Understand the profit per bag:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.
   - Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:
     \[
     \text{Profit per bag} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bags sold:**
   - The total profit made is $3,000.
   - If the profit per bag is $25, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
     \[
     \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{3000}{25}

A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The total hours worked by Alex is \( 7x \) (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The total hours worked by Jacob is \( 9y \) (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both of them worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7x \approx 9y \]

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can assume:
\[ 7x = 9y \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \)
2. \( 7x = 9y \)

From the second equation, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{9}{7}y \]

Substitute \( x = \frac{9}{7}y \) into the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{7}y + y = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}y + \frac{7}{7}y = 35 \]

\[ \frac{16}{7}y = 35 \]

Multiply both sides by 7 to clear the fraction:
\[ 16y = 245 \]

Divide both sides by 16 to solve for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{245}{16} \]

\[ y = 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

E)$91.00",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the information given.

1. **Understand the relationship between cost, selling price, and profit:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the appliance.
   - The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above the cost price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C
     \]
   - The gross profit is given as $20.00. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = S - C = 20.00
     \]

2. **Set up the equation using the profit information:**
   - From the profit equation, we have:
     \[
     1.4C - C = 20.00
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     0.4C = 20.00
     \]

3. **Solve for the cost price \( C \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20.00}{0.4} = 50.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the selling price \( S \):**
   - Substitute \( C = 50.00 \) back into the equation for \( S \):
     \[
     S = 1.4 \times 50.00 = 70.00
     \]

5. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The selling price of the appliance is $70.00, which corresponds to choice D.

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for \(\boxed{70.00}\).

A)750
B)700
C)620
D)600
E)None of these",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest.

The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 500),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum (6%),
- \( T \) is the time in years (4 years).

Let's calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]

\[ \text{SI} = \frac{12000}{100} \]

\[ \text{SI} = 120 \]

Now, to find the total amount Rahul will pay, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{SI} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 500 + 120 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 620 \]

Therefore, the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is Rs. 620.

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (in kilometers).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - The jeep takes 6 hours to travel the distance \( d \).
   - Therefore, the speed during the forward journey is given by the formula:
     \[
     v = \frac{d}{6}
     \]

3. **Return Journey:**
   - The jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr for the return journey.
   - The new speed is \( v + 12 \).
   - The return journey takes 4 hours, so:
     \[
     v + 12 = \frac{d}{4}
     \]

4. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the forward journey, we have:
     \[
     v = \frac{d}{6}
     \]
   - From the return journey, we have:
     \[
     v + 12 = \frac{d}{4}
     \]

5. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( v = \frac{d}{6} \) into the return journey equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{6} + 12 = \frac{d}{4}
     \]
   - Clear the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 12 (the least common multiple of 6 and 4):
     \[
     2d + 144 = 3d
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     3d - 2d = 144
     \]
     \[
     d = 144

1. **Define the wholesale cost:**
   - Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be \( W \).

2. **Calculate the original retail price:**
   - The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost.
   - Therefore, the original retail price is \( W + 0.6W = 1.6W \).

3. **Calculate the actual selling price:**
   - The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \( 1.6W - 0.2 \times 1.6W = 1.6W \times 0.8 = 1.28W \).

4. **Determine the percentage increase over the wholesale cost:**
   - The selling price is \( 1.28W \).
   - The increase over the wholesale cost is \( 1.28W - W = 0.28W \).

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to understand the folding process and how it affects the dimensions of the rectangular sheet.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - If we fold along the length, each part will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{l}{2} + w \right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - If we fold along the width, each part will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( l + \frac{w}{2} \right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

**Step 1: Solve for \( w \) from Equation 1:**
\[
l = 48 - 2w
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( l \) in Equation 2:**
\[
2(48 - 2w) + w = 66
\]
\[
96 - 4w + w = 66
\]
\[
96 - 3w = 66
\]
\[
3w = 30
\]
\[
w = 10
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( l \):**
\[
l + 2(10) = 48
\]
\[
l + 20 = 48
\]
\[
l = 28
\]

Now that we have the dimensions of the original sheet, \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm, we can find the area of the sheet:
\[
\text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the equations and calculations.

**Re-evaluation:**

1. **Equation 1:** \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. **Equation 2:** \( 2l + w = 66 \)

**Step 1: Solve for \( l \) from Equation 2:**
\[
w = 66 - 2l
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( w \) in Equation 1:**
\[
l + 2(66 - 2l) = 48
\]
\[
l + 132 - 4l = 48
\]
\[
-3l + 132 = 48
\]
\[
-3l = 48 - 132
\]
\[
-3l = -84
\]
\[
l = 28
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \( l = 28 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( w \):**
\[
2(28) + w = 66
\]
\[
56 + w = 66
\]
\[
w = 10
\]

The calculations are consistent. The area of the sheet is indeed:
\[
\text{Area} = 28 \times 10 = 280 \, \text{cm}^2

D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to find the diameter of the sphere in which the rectangular solid is inscribed. The key is to realize that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.

The space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be found using the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

In this problem, the dimensions of the rectangular solid are \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\). Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(15^2 = 225\)

Adding these values together:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250}
\]

To simplify \(\sqrt{250}\), we can factor it:

\[
\sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10}
\]

Now, we approximate \(5\sqrt{10}\). Since \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623\), we have:

\[
5 \times 3.1623 \approx 15.8115

1. **Starting Point:** Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement:** A travels 3 km south. This means A moves from (0, 0) to (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement:** A travels 5 km east. This means A moves from (0, -3) to (5, -3).

A)Rs. 697.50
B)Rs. 712.50
C)Rs. 787.50
D)Rs. 750
E)Rs. 780",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the watch based on the given conditions about discounts and profit.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the marked price of the watch.
- \( C \) as the cost price of the watch.
- \( P_1 \) as the profit when a 5% discount is given.
- \( P_2 \) as the profit when a 7% discount is given.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate Selling Prices:**
   - When a 5% discount is given, the selling price is \( 95\% \) of the marked price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price with 5% discount} = 0.95M
     \]
   - When a 7% discount is given, the selling price is \( 93\% \) of the marked price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price with 7% discount} = 0.93M
     \]

2. **Express Profits:**
   - Profit with a 5% discount:
     \[
     P_1 = 0.95M - C
     \]
   - Profit with a 7% discount:
     \[
     P_2 = 0.93M - C
     \]

3. **Relate the Profits:**
   - According to the problem, the profit with a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than the profit with a 5% discount:
     \[
     P_1 - P_2 = 15
     \]
   - Substitute the expressions for \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \):
     \[
     (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplifying the equation gives:
     \[
     0.95M - 0.93M = 15
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     0.02M = 15
     \]

5. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.02 to find \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{15}{0.02} = 750

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500.

The salary \( S \) is given by the formula:
\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want the salary \( S \) to be $1500:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

First, subtract the fixed salary from both sides:
\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Next, solve for Sales by dividing both sides by 0.05:
\[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]
\[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500.

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"COT: To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. **Determine the distance of each side of the square:**
   - Let's assume each side of the square is \(d\) km.

2. **Calculate the time taken for each side:**
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = \(4d\) km (since the plane travels around a square)

4. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Total time = \(\frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}\)

5. **Simplify the total time expression:**
   - Total time = \(d \left(\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{400} + \frac{1}{600} + \frac{1}{800}\right)\)
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 2400
   - Total time = \(d \left(\frac{12}{2400} + \frac{6}{2400} + \frac{4}{2400} + \frac{3}{2400}\right)\)
   - Total time = \(d \left(\frac{25}{2400}\right)\)
   - Total time = \(\frac{25d}{2400}\)

6. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}\)
   - Average speed = \(\frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}}\)
   - Average speed = \(\frac{4d \times 2400}{25d}\)

40,,"Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( w \) as the number of white sharpeners.
- \( b \) as the number of brown sharpeners.
- \( p_b \) as the price of each brown sharpener in rupees.
- \( p_w = p_b + 1 \) as the price of each white sharpener in rupees, since each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of sharpeners is 18:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. The total cost of the sharpeners is 100 rupees:
   \[
   w \cdot p_w + b \cdot p_b = 100
   \]

Substituting \( p_w = p_b + 1 \) into the second equation, we get:
\[
w \cdot (p_b + 1) + b \cdot p_b = 100
\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[
w \cdot p_b + w + b \cdot p_b = 100
\]

Combine the terms with \( p_b \):
\[
(w + b) \cdot p_b + w = 100
\]

Since \( w + b = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:
\[
18 \cdot p_b + w = 100
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( w \):
\[
w = 100 - 18 \cdot p_b
\]

Now, substitute \( w = 18 - b \) from the first equation into the equation above:
\[
18 - b = 100 - 18 \cdot p_b
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( b \):
\[
b = 18 \cdot p_b - 82
\]

Since \( b \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 18 \cdot p_b - 82 \) must be a non-negative integer. Let's test the options to find a suitable \( p_b \).

Testing the options:

- **Option A (10, 8):** 
  - \( w = 10 \), \( b = 8 \)
  - \( w + b = 18 \) (satisfied)
  - Substitute into the cost equation:
    \[
    10 \cdot (p_b + 1) + 8 \cdot p_b = 100
    \]
    \[
    10p_b + 10 + 8p_b = 100
    \]
    \[
    18p_b + 10 = 100
    \]
    \[
    18p_b = 90
    \]
    \[
    p_b = 5
    \]
  - This works, as \( p_b = 5 \) is a valid integer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- **Option A (10, 8):** Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is still to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Since hose A's rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, the rate of hose B is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Therefore, hose B also fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B fills \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Thus, the answer is \( \boxed{8} \).

D)24567
E)43566",A,"COT: To solve this problem, let's denote the 5-digit number as \( x \).

According to the problem, when a 1 is placed after the number, it becomes three times as large as when a 1 is placed before it. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

1. Placing a 1 after the number: \( 10x + 1 \)
2. Placing a 1 before the number: \( 100000 + x \)

The equation given by the problem is:

\[ 10x + 1 = 3(100000 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:
   \[ 10x + 1 = 300000 + 3x \]

2. Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides to get:
   \[ 10x - 3x + 1 = 300000 \]
   \[ 7x + 1 = 300000 \]

3. Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[ 7x = 299999 \]

4. Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):

   - The man pays Rs.31.50 per month for 12 months.
   - Total amount paid = 31.50 * 12 = Rs.378.

2. **Calculate the Total Interest Paid:**
   - The principal amount borrowed is Rs.360.
   - Total interest paid = Total amount paid - Principal = 378 - 360 = Rs.18.

3. **Calculate the Interest Rate:**
   - The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis. Since the loan is for 1 year (12 months), we can use the simple interest formula:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}

   - One dozen equals 12, so five dozen equals \(5 \times 12 = 60\) toys.
   - Therefore, each box contains 60 toys.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys in one tempo:**
   - There are 98 boxes in one tempo.
   - Since each box contains 60 toys, the total number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60\).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(98 \times 60 = 5880\).
   - So, one tempo can carry 5,880 toys.

4. **Determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:**
   - We need to find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys.
   - Divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry: \(\frac{29400}{5880}\).

5. **Perform the division:**
   - \(\frac{29400}{5880} = 5\).

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. The correct answer is:

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2 \times 1 \times 8!}
\]

The \( 8! \) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains for Mr. Blue to finish.

1. **Determine the rate of work for each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) of a house.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \).

5. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - The total contract is to paint 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Remaining work = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \).

6. **Calculate how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.
   - To complete \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take Mr. Blue \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract. The correct answer is:

56,,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of a hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understand the structure of the hollow cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is on both sides.

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes:**
   - The entire cube (5 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - The total number of 1 cm cubes in a 5 cm cube is \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).

3. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes in the hollow part:**
   - The hollow part is a cube of size 3 cm.
   - The number of 1 cm cubes in a 3 cm cube is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).

4. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes in the shell:**
   - The shell is the part of the cube that remains after removing the hollow part.
   - The number of 1 cm cubes in the shell is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

5. **Determine the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces of the shell cubes are painted.
   - The inner faces of the shell cubes that are adjacent to the hollow part remain unpainted.

6. **Calculate the unpainted faces:**
   - The inner cube (3 cm) has a surface area of \(6 \times (3 \times 3) = 54\) faces.
   - These 54 faces are the ones that remain unpainted because they are adjacent to the hollow part.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 54.

However, the problem asks for the total number of unpainted faces of all smaller cubes, including those in the hollow part. Since the hollow part is not painted at all, all its faces are unpainted.

7. **Calculate the total unpainted faces:**
   - The hollow part has 27 cubes, each with 6 unpainted faces, totaling \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces.
   - Adding the 54 unpainted faces from the shell, we get \(162 + 54 = 216\).

It seems there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement or choices, as the calculated number of unpainted faces does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate:

- The hollow part contributes 162 unpainted faces.

ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we have the correct understanding and calculations.

1. **Structure of the hollow cube:**
   - The outer cube is 5 cm on each side.
   - The inner hollow cube is 3 cm on each side (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side, reducing the inner cube by 2 cm in each dimension).

2. **Number of smaller cubes:**
   - Total smaller cubes in the 5 cm cube: \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).
   - Smaller cubes in the 3 cm hollow part: \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).
   - Smaller cubes in the shell: \(125 - 27 = 98\).

3. **Unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The 27 cubes in the hollow part have all their faces unpainted: \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces.
   - The shell cubes have some faces unpainted. Specifically, the faces that are adjacent to the hollow part.

4. **Unpainted faces in the shell:**
   - The inner surface of the shell (which is the outer surface of the hollow part) has a surface area of \(6 \times (3 \times 3) = 54\) faces.
   - These 54 faces are unpainted because they are adjacent to the hollow part.

5. **Total unpainted faces:**
   - Total unpainted faces from the hollow part: 162.
   - Total unpainted faces from the shell: 54.

1. **Determine the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates must be vanilla flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

3. **Determine the percentage of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the rest (which are the vanilla flavored chocolates) are squashed.
   - So, 90% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored.

4. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored, the remaining vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% (total vanilla flavored) - 81% (squashed vanilla flavored) = 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

D)28 days
E)29 days",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to consider the net progress the frog makes each day and how that affects the total time it takes to escape the well.

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog jumps up 3 meters but then falls back 2 meters. Therefore, the net progress per day is:
   \[
   3 \, \text{meters up} - 2 \, \text{meters down} = 1 \, \text{meter per day}

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"COT: To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define the 5 consecutive odd numbers**: 
   Let the first odd number be \( x \). Then the consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as \( x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \).

2. **Calculate their sum**:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20
   \]

3. **Condition for the sum**:
   The problem states that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we need:
   \[
   \frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}
   \]
   to be a perfect square.

4. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \(\frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2\), where \(n\) is an integer. Then:
   \[
   x + 4 = 2n^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2n^2 - 4
   \]

5. **Find the range for \(x\)**:
   Since \(x\) is a two-digit odd number, we have:
   \[
   10 \leq x \leq 99

   Substituting for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   10 \leq 2n^2 - 4 \leq 99

6. **Find possible values for \(n\)**:
   The integer values for \(n\) that satisfy \(7 \leq n^2 \leq 51.5\) are \(n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).

7. **Calculate possible values for \(x\)**:
   - For \(n = 3\), \(x = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14\) (not odd)
   - For \(n = 4\), \(x = 2(4)^2 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28\) (not odd)
   - For \(n = 5\), \(x = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46\) (not odd)
   - For \(n = 6\), \(x = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68\) (not odd)
   - For \(n = 7\), \(x = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94\) (not odd)

   Since none of these are odd, let's check the next odd numbers by adding 1 to each:

E)1000",E,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the class. Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \).

1. **Football Interest**: 8% of the students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).

2. **Cricket Interest**: \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).

3. **Basketball Interest**: 10% of the students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

4. **Not Interested in Any Games**: The problem states that 20 students are not interested in any games.

Since the students who are interested in Football, Cricket, or Basketball, along with those not interested in any games, account for all the students in the class, we can set up the following equation:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

Let's simplify and solve this equation:

- Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal: \(\frac{4}{5} = 0.80\).

Substitute this into the equation:

\[
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
0.98x + 20 = x
\]

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:

\[
20 = x - 0.98x
\]

\[
20 = 0.02x

Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This equation implies that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.

Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we find:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R's age and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:

\[ r + t = 50 \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we substitute back to find:

\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms our calculations. Now, using the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we can solve for \( r - q \):

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]

Simplifying:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This confirms that the difference \( r - q \) is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, the difference between R's age and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can solve for \( r - q \):

\[ r - q = 25 - t \]

Given that \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:

\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) \]

63,,"In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for batting average and set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Understand the Batting Average Formula:**
   - Batting Average = Total Runs Scored / Total Matches Played

2. **Set Up the Initial Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
   - His current batting average is 51, so:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{x} = 51
     \]
   - Therefore, Total Runs Scored = \( 51x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation After the Finals:**
   - In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs.
   - His new batting average becomes 54, and the total number of matches becomes \( x + 1 \).
   - So, the new equation is:
     \[
     \frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
     \]
   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     51x + 78 = 54x + 54
     \]
   - Rearrange the terms to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     78 - 54 = 54x - 51x
     \]
     \[
     24 = 3x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Total Number of Matches:**
   - The total number of matches played by Sachin in the season, including the finals, is \( x + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 9.

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
A)3
B)4
C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

1. **Single Letter Codes:**
   - If we use \( n \) different letters, we can create \( n \) single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes:**
   - For pairs of letters, since the order does not matter, the number of unique pairs we can create from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes:**
   - The total number of unique codes we can create is the sum of single letter codes and pair of letters codes: \( n + \binom{n}{2} \).

We need this total to be at least 10, as there are 10 different types of books.

Let's calculate for different values of \( n \):

- **If \( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
  - Total codes: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)

- **If \( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 4
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
  - Total codes: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \)

- **If \( n = 5 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 5
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)
  - Total codes: \( 5 + 10 = 15 \)

We find that with \( n = 4 \), we can create exactly 10 unique codes, which is the minimum required. Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.

The answer is \( \boxed{4} \).

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( b \) be the breadth of the rectangle in meters.
   - According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. So, we can express the length as:
     \[
     l = 4b + 1
     \]

2. **Use the area of the rectangle:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area} = l \times b
     \]
   - Substitute the expression for \( l \) into the area formula:
     \[
     (4b + 1) \times b = 150
     \]
   - Simplify and solve the quadratic equation:
     \[
     4b^2 + b = 150
     \]
     \[
     4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
     \]

3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, calculate the roots:
     \[
     b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8}
     \]
     \[
     b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
     \]
   - The two possible solutions for \( b \) are:
     \[
     b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{(valid, as breadth must be positive)}
     \]
     \[
     b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \quad \text{(not valid, as breadth cannot be negative)}
     \]

4. **Find the length:**
   - Substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25
     \]

5. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(l + b)
     \]
   - Substitute the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
     \[
     P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
A)8.5
B)10.5
C)12.5
D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5

D)15
E)19",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to meet the cake production requirements within the given time frame.

1. **Understand the requirements:**
   - We need to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

2. **Understand the production capacity of each helper:**
   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour or 35 small cakes per hour.

3. **Calculate the total time available:**
   - The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the total production needed in terms of hours:**
   - For large cakes: 
     - We need 20 large cakes.
     - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
     - Therefore, the total hours needed for large cakes = 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes per hour = 10 hours.

   - For small cakes:
     - We need 700 small cakes.
     - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
     - Therefore, the total hours needed for small cakes = 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.

5. **Calculate the total helper-hours needed:**
   - Total helper-hours needed = 10 hours (for large cakes) + 20 hours (for small cakes) = 30 hours.

6. **Determine the number of helpers required:**
   - The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

E)10",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of each point on the line and use the given information to find the length of line segment RU.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Position the points on a number line:**
   - Let's place point R at position 0 on the number line. Therefore, point S will be at position 5 because RS = 5.
   - Since RT = 17, point T will be at position 17.

3. **Verify the position of S and T:**
   - The distance ST is given as 22. Since S is at 5 and T is at 17, the distance ST = 17 - 5 = 12, which is incorrect. This means our initial assumption about the positions of S and T needs adjustment.

4. **Re-evaluate the positions:**
   - Since ST = 22, and we know T is at 17, S must be at 17 - 22 = -5. This means S is at position -5 on the number line.

5. **Find the position of U:**
   - U is the midpoint of ST. Since S is at -5 and T is at 17, the midpoint U is at \((-5 + 17) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\).

6. **Determine the length of RU:**
   - R is at position 0, and U is at position 6. Therefore, the length of RU is \(6 - 0 = 6\).

B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the amounts of falafel in pita breads, rolls, and baguettes.

1. **Establish the relationship between pita breads and rolls:**
   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Therefore, the amount of falafel in one roll is equivalent to the amount in three pita breads.

2. **Establish the relationship between rolls and baguettes:**
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.
   - Therefore, the amount of falafel in one roll is equivalent to the amount in \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

3. **Combine the relationships to find the relationship between pita breads and baguettes:**
   - From step 1, we know that one roll is equivalent to three pita breads.
   - From step 2, we know that one roll is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.
   - Therefore, three pita breads are equivalent to \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

4. **Find the relationship between one pita bread and baguettes:**
   - If three pita breads are equivalent to \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes, then one pita bread is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{9} \) of a baguette.

5. **Determine how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes:**
   - If one pita bread is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{9} \) of a baguette, then to find how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of pita breads} \times \frac{5}{9} = 2

   - Solving for the number of pita breads:
     \[
     \text{Number of pita breads} = 2 \times \frac{9}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6
     \]

Since 3.6 is not one of the given choices, let's verify the calculations:

- We found that one pita bread is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{9} \) of a baguette.
- To find how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes, we multiply:
  \[
  2 \div \frac{5}{9} = 2 \times \frac{9}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage increase needed:**
   To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.80P \), we need to find the percentage increase from \( 0.80P \) to \( P \).

   The increase in price needed is:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = P - 0.80P = 0.20P
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage increase:**
   The percentage increase is calculated as the increase divided by the discounted price, multiplied by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.20P}{0.80P}\right) \times 100\%

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's denote:
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_p = 10v_s \) as the speed of the plane, since the plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship.
- \( t_s \) as the time the ship has been traveling when they meet.
- \( t_p \) as the time the plane has been traveling when they meet.

Given that the ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts, we have:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by the ship} = v_s \cdot t_s = 180 + v_s \cdot t_p \]

The plane starts after the ship has traveled 180 miles, so:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by the plane} = v_p \cdot t_p = 10v_s \cdot t_p \]

Since they meet at the same point, the distances they have traveled from the starting point are equal:
\[ 180 + v_s \cdot t_p = 10v_s \cdot t_p \]

We can solve for \( t_p \) by rearranging the equation:
\[ 180 = 10v_s \cdot t_p - v_s \cdot t_p \]
\[ 180 = 9v_s \cdot t_p \]
\[ t_p = \frac{180}{9v_s} \]

Now, substitute \( t_p \) back into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship:
\[ \text{Distance from starting point} = 180 + v_s \cdot t_p \]
\[ = 180 + v_s \cdot \frac{180}{9v_s} \]
\[ = 180 + \frac{180}{9} \]
\[ = 180 + 20 \]
\[ = 200 \]

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 200 miles.

The correct answer is:

76,,"In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"COT: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. The idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample should be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - 300 deer were tagged in 2001.
   - In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of them were tagged.

2. **Set up the proportion:**
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is \(\frac{20}{500}\).
   - We assume this proportion is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population. Therefore, the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is \(\frac{300}{N}\), where \(N\) is the total deer population.

3. **Set the proportions equal to each other:**
   \[
   \frac{20}{500} = \frac{300}{N}
   \]

4. **Solve for \(N\):**
   - First, simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{20}{500} = \frac{1}{25}
     \]
   - Now, set the simplified proportion equal to the right side:
     \[
     \frac{1}{25} = \frac{300}{N}
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \(N\):
     \[
     1 \times N = 25 \times 300
     \]
     \[
     N = 7500
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total deer population in the forest is 7500.

Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{7500} \).

77,,"In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
A)0.9
B)0.8
C)0.6
D)0.65
E)1.5",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. Let's break it down:

1. **Train Schedules:**
   - The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM. So, the main line train arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, etc.
   - The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, etc.

2. **Time Intervals:**
   - From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the only train available.
   - From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first train to arrive.
   - From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first train to arrive.
   - From 5:12 to 5:20, the harbor line train is the first train to arrive.
   - This pattern repeats every 10 minutes.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - In each 10-minute cycle, the main line train is the first train for 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02 and from 5:10 to 5:12).
   - The harbor line train is the first train for 8 minutes (from 5:02 to 5:10 and from 5:12 to 5:20).

4. **Probability:**
   - The probability of catching the main line train first is the ratio of the time intervals when the main line train is first to the total cycle time.
   - Probability = (Time main line is first) / (Total cycle time) = 2/10 = 0.2

A)40.8
B)41.6
C)42.2
D)43.5
E)44.8",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the heavy-duty truck that was added to the group of vehicles.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:**

   The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Therefore, the total weight of these vehicles is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of 10 vehicles} = 10 \times 12.2 = 122 \text{ tons}
   \]

2. **Determine the new average weight after adding the heavy-duty truck:**

   The average weight of the 11 vehicles (10 original vehicles + 1 heavy-duty truck) is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the 11 vehicles:**

   The total weight of the 11 vehicles is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of 11 vehicles} = 11 \times 14.8 = 162.8 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Find the weight of the heavy-duty truck:**

   The weight of the heavy-duty truck is the difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the heavy-duty truck} = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 \text{ tons}

79,,"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"COT: To solve this problem, let's define some variables and work through the steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the population of Boomtown one year ago.

2. **Population Growth:**
   - According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
   - Therefore, the population one year from now will be \( 1.1P \).
   - The population two years from now will be \( 1.1 \times 1.1P = 1.21P \).

3. **Condition Given:**
   - The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     1.21P = 2 \times \text{Population one year ago}
     \]

4. **Solve for Population One Year Ago:**
   - Let \( x \) be the population one year ago.
   - According to the condition, \( 1.21P = 2x \).
   - We also know that \( P = 1.1x \) because the population increased by 10% over the last year.

5. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( P = 1.1x \) into the equation \( 1.21P = 2x \):
     \[
     1.21(1.1x) = 2x
     \]
     \[
     1.331x = 2x
     \]

6. **Calculate the Increase:**
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     1.331x = 2x \implies 2x - 1.331x = 0.669x
     \]
     \[
     0.669x = 0.669x
     \]
   - The equation simplifies to show that the population one year ago was \( x \) and the population now is \( 1.1x \).

7. **Calculate the Percent Increase:**
   - The percent increase from \( x \) to \( 1.1x \) is:
     \[
     \frac{1.1x - x}{x} \times 100\% = \frac{0.1x}{x} \times 100\% = 10\%
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The percent increase in Boomtown over the last year is closest to 10%, but since this is not an option, we need to re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the population one year ago was \( x \), and the population now is \( 1.1x \), which means the increase was actually 21% to match the condition of doubling in two years.

Therefore, the closest choice to the actual percent increase over the last year is:

**B) 40%**
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, let's go through the steps again with a clearer approach:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the population of Boomtown one year ago.

2. **Population Growth:**
   - The population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
   - Therefore, the population one year from now will be \( 1.1P \).
   - The population two years from now will be \( 1.1 \times 1.1P = 1.21P \).

3. **Condition Given:**
   - The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     1.21P = 2 \times \text{Population one year ago}
     \]

4. **Solve for Population One Year Ago:**
   - Let \( x \) be the population one year ago.
   - According to the condition, \( 1.21P = 2x \).
   - We also know that \( P = 1.1x \) because the population increased by 10% over the last year.

5. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( P = 1.1x \) into the equation \( 1.21P = 2x \):
     \[
     1.21(1.1x) = 2x
     \]
     \[
     1.331x = 2x
     \]

6. **Calculate the Increase:**
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     1.331x = 2x \implies 2x - 1.331x = 0.669x
     \]
     \[
     0.669x = 0.669x
     \]
   - The equation simplifies to show that the population one year ago was \( x \) and the population now is \( 1.1x \).

7. **Calculate the Percent Increase:**
   - The percent increase from \( x \) to \( 1.1x \) is:
     \[
     \frac{1.1x - x}{x} \times 100\% = \frac{0.1x}{x} \times 100\% = 10\%
     \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the problem's condition. Let's re-evaluate:

- We need to find the percent increase from \( x \) to \( P \) such that \( 1.21P = 2x \).
- Solving \( 1.21(1.1x) = 2x \) gives:
  \[
  1.331x = 2x
  \]
  \[
  1.331 = 2 \implies x = \frac{2}{1.331}P
  \]

- The population one year ago was \( \frac{2}{1.331}P \), and the population now is \( P \).

- The percent increase from \( \frac{2}{1.331}P \) to \( P \) is:
  \[
  \left(\frac{P - \frac{2}{1.331}P}{\frac{2}{1.331}P}\right) \times 100\%
  \]

- Simplifying:
  \[
  \left(\frac{1.331 - 2}{2}\right) \times 100\% \approx 50\%
  \]

Therefore, the closest choice to the actual percent increase over the last year is:

A)62, 35
B)62, 34
C)34, 62
D)42, 62
E)62, 42",B,"COT: To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( A \) be the amount of money Arjun has.
- Let \( S \) be the amount of money Sajal has.

We have two conditions given in the problem:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
   - Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).
   - According to the condition: 
     \[
     S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
     \]

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - After giving $10, Sajal will have \( S - 10 \).
   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - According to the condition:
     \[
     A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
     \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

### Equation 1:
\[
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
\]
\[
S + 30 = 2A - 60
\]
\[
S = 2A - 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Equation 2:
\[
A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
\]
\[
A + 10 = 3S - 30
\]
\[
A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 310
\]
\[
310 = 6A - A
\]
\[
310 = 5A
\]
\[
A = 62
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):

\[
S = 2(62) - 90
\]
\[
S = 124 - 90
\]
\[
S = 34

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"COT: To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Area of the Triangles:**
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, so each triangle has a base of \( s \) and a height of \( s - 4 \).
   - The area of each triangle is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70 \implies s \times (s - 4) = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We solve the quadratic equation \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
     where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
     \[
     s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     \[
     s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, we have \( s = 14 \).

5. **Finding the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The side length of the original square is 14 feet.
   - Therefore, the perimeter of the original square is:
     \[
     4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ feet}

B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means to reduce the length of the ribbon in the ratio 5:3.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts. This implies that the new length is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the original length.

2. **Original Length**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm.

3. **Calculate the New Length**: To find the new length, multiply the original length by the fraction \(\frac{3}{5}\):

   - Since \( a \) is a digit (0 to 9), and \( c \) is also a digit (0 to 9), we need to find valid integer values for \( c \) such that \( a = 10 - 3c \) is also a digit.

   - \( a = 10 - 3c \) implies:
     - \( 0 \leq 10 - 3c \leq 9 \)
     - Solving \( 10 - 3c \geq 0 \) gives \( c \leq \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \), so \( c \leq 3 \).
     - Solving \( 10 - 3c \leq 9 \) gives \( c \geq \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \), so \( c \geq 0 \).

   - Therefore, \( c \) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

7. **Calculating \( M \) for Each Valid \( c \):**
   - For \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 - 3(0) = 10 \) (not valid since \( a \) must be a digit).
   - For \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \).
   - For \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \).
   - For \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \).

8. **Finding \( M \) for Each Valid Pair \((a, c)\):**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) and \( M > N \) implies \( a > c \).

   - For \( c = 1 \), \( a = 7 \):
     - \( M = 700 + 10b + 1 \) for \( b = 0 \) to 9.
     - \( M = 701, 711, 721, \ldots, 791 \) (10 values).

   - For \( c = 2 \), \( a = 4 \):
     - \( M = 400 + 10b + 2 \) for \( b = 0 \) to 9.
     - \( M = 402, 412, 422, \ldots, 492 \) (10 values).

   - For \( c = 3 \), \( a = 1 \):
     - \( M = 100 + 10b + 3 \) for \( b = 0 \) to 9.
     - \( M = 103, 113, 123, \ldots, 193 \) (10 values).

9. **Counting Values of \( M \) Greater Than 300:**
   - From the above, only the values for \( c = 1 \) and \( c = 2 \) are greater than 300.
   - Total values of \( M \) greater than 300: \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

Therefore, the number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is \(\boxed{20}\).

A)550
B)570
C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the least possible number of students in the school given the percentages of students who took only physics and only math.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school.
   - According to the problem, 20% of the students took only physics, and 28% took only math.

2. **Translate Percentages to Equations:**
   - The number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \).
   - The number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).

3. **Calculate Total Students in Both Subjects:**
   - Since these percentages are for students who took only one subject, there is no overlap between the two groups.
   - Therefore, the total number of students who took either physics or math is \( 0.2N + 0.28N = 0.48N \).

4. **Determine the Minimum Number of Students:**
   - We know that \( N > 501 \).
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) such that \( 0.48N \) is an integer and \( N > 501 \).

5. **Check the Options:**
   - Calculate \( 0.48N \) for each option to see if it results in an integer:
     - \( N = 550 \): \( 0.48 \times 550 = 264 \) (integer)
     - \( N = 570 \): \( 0.48 \times 570 = 273.6 \) (not an integer)
     - \( N = 600 \): \( 0.48 \times 600 = 288 \) (integer)
     - \( N = 700 \): \( 0.48 \times 700 = 336 \) (integer)

6. **Select the Smallest Valid Option:**
   - The smallest \( N \) that results in an integer for \( 0.48N \) and is greater than 501 is 550.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is \( \boxed{550} \).

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.

2. **Calculate Raj's age five years ago:**
   - Raj's current age is 17 years.
   - Five years ago, Raj's age was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years.

3. **Set up the equation for Rahim's age five years ago:**
   - Let Rahim's age five years ago be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{3}x
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 12 \times 3 = 36

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area.

1. **Determine the Grazing Area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Here, \( r = 14 \) feet, so:
     \[
     A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
     \]
   - Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
   - To find the number of days \( D \) it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate:
     \[
     D = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544
     \]
   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

However, since the choices provided are in whole numbers and do not include 62, we should consider the closest option, which is 61 days.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Determine the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price.

   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit}
   \]

   \[
   27.50 = \text{CP} + 0.10 \times \text{CP}
   \]

   \[
   27.50 = 1.10 \times \text{CP}
   \]

   \[
   \text{CP} = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25
   \]

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this selling price with the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   \[
   \text{Profit/Loss} = \text{SP} - \text{CP} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75
   \]

   Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a profit of Rs. 0.75.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\%

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. Let's denote:

- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800.
2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040.

We can set up two equations based on these scenarios:

1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

We can solve these two equations to find the values of \( F \) and \( V \).

**Step 1: Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):**

\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]

\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]

\[
80V = 240
\]

\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

So, the variable cost per call \( V \) is Rs.3.

**Step 2: Substitute \( V = 3 \) back into the first equation to find \( F \):**

\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]

\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

So, the fixed part of the bill \( F \) is Rs.180.

**Step 3: Calculate the bill for 500 calls:**

Now that we have \( F = 180 \) and \( V = 3 \), we can calculate the bill for 500 calls:

\[
\text{Bill} = F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[
\text{Bill} = 180 + 1500 = 1680

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point simultaneously after they begin rotating.

1. **Determine the time for one full rotation for each ball:**

   - **Ball A:** It makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of A} = \frac{26 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **Ball B:** It makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of B} = \frac{35 \text{ minutes}}{5} = 7 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**

   We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes to determine when both balls will be at the starting point again.

   - The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).
   - The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).

   Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers and do not share any common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply their product:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:**

   - 91 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes make 1 hour).

Therefore, both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

   - Fiction books = 20

2. **Identify the overlap:**
   - We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

3. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**
   - Let \( H \) be the set of hardcover books and \( F \) be the set of fiction books.
   - We want to maximize \( |H \cap F| \), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

4. **Calculate the maximum overlap:**
   - The maximum overlap occurs when the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is as large as possible, without exceeding the total number of hardcover or fiction books.
   - Since there are 20 fiction books, the maximum number of these that can also be hardcover is 20 (because there are only 20 fiction books available).

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - If all 20 fiction books are hardcover, then there are 10 hardcover books left that are not fiction (since there are 30 hardcover books in total).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on each weekday (Monday through Saturday).
   - On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers as it does on a weekday, so it buys \( 2x \) newspapers.

2. **Calculate the Cost:**
   - The cost of newspapers from Monday to Saturday is \( 1 \times x \) dollars per day. Over six days, this amounts to \( 6x \) dollars.
   - On Sunday, the cost is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.

B)12

D)24
E)25",A,"COT: To solve this problem, let's define some variables and set up an equation based on the given information.

1. Let \( n \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
2. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.
3. If all \( n \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{n} \) rupees.

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( n - 4 \).

4. The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them paid \( \frac{96}{n} + 4 \).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the cost per person for those who attended:

\[
\frac{96}{n - 4} = \frac{96}{n} + 4
\]

To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( n(n - 4) \):

\[
96n = 96(n - 4) + 4n(n - 4)
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
96n = 96n - 384 + 4n^2 - 16n
\]

Cancel \( 96n \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4n^2 - 16n - 384
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = n^2 - 4n - 96
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \):

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

\[
n = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
n = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( n = 12 \).

B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"COT: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, we can express the total amount distributed in terms of \( x \):
- The total amount received by the 2 nephews is \( 2x \).
- The total amount received by the 4 daughters is \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- The total amount received by the 5 sons is \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The sum of all these amounts is equal to the total amount of Rs 8600:
\[
2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
43x = 8600
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 43:
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200

Now that we have \( x = 200 \), we can find out how much each daughter receives:
