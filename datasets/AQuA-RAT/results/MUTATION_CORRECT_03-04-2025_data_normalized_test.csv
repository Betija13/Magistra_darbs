0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"A)5(√3 + 1)
------
To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( d_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base of the tower is \( d_2 \).

From the trigonometric identity for tangent, we have:
1. \( \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \) which implies \( h = d_1 \).
2. \( \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( h = \sqrt{3} \cdot d_2 \).

Since \( h = d_1 \), we can equate the two expressions for \( h \):
\[ d_1 = \sqrt{3} \cdot d_2 \]

The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ d_1 - d_2 = d_1 - \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} = d_1 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]

The speed of the car is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]

The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( d_2 \), which is:
\[ d_2 = \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

The time \( t \) it takes to travel this remaining distance is:
\[ t = \frac{d_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{d_1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{d_1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To simplify \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Therefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

The correct answer is (A).

A)4,000
B)4,200
C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"(E)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as \( x \).

1. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective.
   - Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

2. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The remaining staplers are non-defective, which is \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

3. **Rejected Non-defective Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
   - Therefore, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

According to the problem, 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.018x = 72 \]

To find \( x \), solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{72}{0.018} \]

\[ x = 4000 \]

Thus, the total number of staplers produced that day is 4,000.

The correct answer is (A) 4,000.

A)4
B)5
C)7
D)6
E)8",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

First, calculate the number of toys in one box:
- One dozen equals 12, so five dozen toys equal 5 * 12 = 60 toys per box.

Next, calculate the total number of toys in one tempo:
- Each tempo contains 98 boxes, so the total number of toys in one tempo is 98 * 60 = 5,880 toys.

Now, determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:
- Divide the total number of toys (29,400) by the number of toys per tempo (5,880):
  29,400 / 5,880 = 5

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

77,,"In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
A)0.9
B)0.8
C)0.6
D)0.65
E)1.5",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station.

The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM, so it arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on.

The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so it arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.

The time interval between the main line train and the harbor line train is 2 minutes. Therefore, if the man arrives at the station at any time between 5:00 and 5:02, he will catch the main line train. If he arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train.

The total time interval between two consecutive main line trains is 10 minutes. Out of these 10 minutes, the man will catch the main line train if he arrives in the first 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02).

Therefore, the probability of catching the main line train is the ratio of the time interval for catching the main line train to the total time interval between two main line trains:

Probability = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval)
             = 2 minutes / 10 minutes
             = 0.2

Thus, the probability of the man catching the first train (main line train) is 0.2.

However, the options provided do not include 0.2. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem or options, but based on the given options, none of them match the calculated probability. Therefore, the closest logical choice based on the problem setup is not available, but we must choose an option.

Given the options, the most reasonable choice based on the context and typical probability values is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that selling the book for Rs 27.50 results in a 10% profit. 

Let the cost price be Rs x. Then, a 10% profit on the cost price means the selling price is 110% of the cost price. Therefore, we have:

1.10 * x = 27.50

Solving for x, we get:

x = 27.50 / 1.10
x = 25

So, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.

Now, if the book is sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage. 

The selling price in this case is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25. The profit is:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 25.75 - 25
Profit = 0.75

To find the profit percentage, we use the formula:

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit Percentage = 3%

Since the result is positive, it indicates a profit of 3%.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3% Profit.

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after starting together.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation.

Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times (13 minutes and 7 minutes) to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.

The prime factorization of 13 is 13 (since 13 is a prime number), and the prime factorization of 7 is 7 (since 7 is also a prime number). The LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest power of all prime factors present in the numbers.

Since 13 and 7 are both prime and do not share any common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes = 1 hour, 91 - 60 = 31 minutes).

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

To solve the problem, let's define the number of newspapers bought on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as \( x \).

- The cost of newspapers from Monday to Saturday is \( 6x \times 1 = 6x \).
- The cost of newspapers on Sunday is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \).

The total cost for the week is given as $210:

A)12 am on the next day
B)5 am on the next day
C)5 pm on the next day
D)2 pm on the next day
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when Train B catches up to Train A.

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, so Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A:**
   - Train B travels at 72 kmph and Train A travels at 40 kmph.
   - The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is: \(72 \text{ kmph} - 40 \text{ kmph} = 32 \text{ kmph}\).

3. **Time taken for Train B to catch up:**
   - Train B needs to cover the 120 km head start of Train A.
   - Time taken to catch up is: \(\frac{120 \text{ km}}{32 \text{ kmph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train B leaves at 2 pm. Adding 3.75 hours to 2 pm gives us:
   - 2 pm + 3 hours 45 minutes = 5:45 pm on the same day.

Since 5:45 pm on the same day is not listed in the options, the correct choice is:

D)8.71
E)8.72",C,"The area of the square paper is \(20 \times 20 = 400 \, \text{cm}^2\).

The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \, \text{cm}\).

The area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is \(\pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2\).

The area of one semi-circle is \(\frac{100\pi}{2} = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2\).

The total area of the two semi-circles is \(2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2\).

The area of the remaining paper is \(400 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2\).

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), the area of the remaining paper is approximately:

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.

1. **Total Golf Balls at the Start**: The store started with 600 golf balls.

2. **Golf Balls Sold**: The store sold 80% of its inventory by the end of the day. 
   - 80% of 600 is calculated as: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   So, the store sold 480 golf balls.

3. **Equal Number of Yellow and White Balls Sold**: The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

4. **Number of White Golf Balls Sold**: Since all white golf balls were sold, and they were sold in equal number to the yellow golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total golf balls sold:
   \[
   \frac{480}{2} = 240
   \]
   Therefore, the store had 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.

5. **Number of Yellow Golf Balls at the Start**: Since the total number of golf balls at the start was 600, and 240 of them were white, the number of yellow golf balls is:
   \[
   600 - 240 = 360
   \]

Thus, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

The correct answer is (E) 360.

A)96
B)48
C)32
D)25
E)18",D,"(D)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students surveyed based on the information given about song selections.

Each student selects 2 songs from a list of 10 songs. We are told that each song was selected 5 times. This means that across all students, each of the 10 songs was chosen 5 times, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 song selections.

Since each student selects 2 songs, the total number of students surveyed can be calculated by dividing the total number of song selections by the number of songs each student selects:

Total number of students = Total song selections / Songs per student = 50 / 2 = 25.

Therefore, the number of students surveyed is 25.

A)10
B)23
C)16
D)18
E)12",E,"To solve this problem, let's define:

- \( H \) as the number of times the coin lands on Heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin lands on Tails.

We know that the total number of flips is 20, so:

\[ H + T = 20 \]

Each time the coin lands on Heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, so the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is \( 2H \).

Each time the coin lands on Tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is \( 3T \).

Since neither won or lost any amount, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan equals the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher:

\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

From the second equation, solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute \( T \) in the first equation:

\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[ 3H + 2H = 60 \]

\[ 5H = 60 \]

\[ H = 12 \]

Thus, the coin landed on Heads 12 times.

The correct answer is (E) 12.
------
To solve this problem, let's define:
- \( h \) as the number of times the coin lands on heads.
- \( t \) as the number of times the coin lands on tails.

We know that the total number of flips is 20, so:
\[ h + t = 20 \]

Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each head, and Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each tail. Since neither won or lost any money, the total amount exchanged must be zero:
\[ 2h = 3t \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( h + t = 20 \)
2. \( 2h = 3t \)

From equation 2, solve for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{2h}{3} \]

Substitute \( t \) in equation 1:
\[ h + \frac{2h}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3h + 2h = 60 \]
\[ 5h = 60 \]
\[ h = 12 \]

Thus, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

The correct answer is (E) 12.

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the cost of repairing to the cost of purchasing new tires.

1. **Cost of New Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $180
   - Lifespan = 4 years
   - Average cost per year = $180 / 4 = $45

2. **Cost of Repairing Current Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $40
   - Lifespan extension = 1 year
   - Average cost per year = $40 / 1 = $40

3. **Percentage Increase Calculation:**
   - Difference in cost per year = $45 (new tires) - $40 (repair) = $5
   - Percentage increase = ($5 / $40) * 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions of the problem.

1. **Determine the total revenue from selling the pens:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

2. **Calculate the total number of pens that need to be manufactured:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, only 90% of the manufactured pens are delivered.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - 90% of \( x \) = 7200 pens.
   - \( 0.9x = 7200 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \) pens.

3. **Determine the total manufacturing cost:**
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the manufacturing cost per pen.
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 8000 \times C \).
   - Profit = 25% of the total manufacturing cost.
   - Total revenue = Total manufacturing cost + Profit.
   - Rs. 72,000 = \( 8000C + 0.25 \times 8000C \).
   - Rs. 72,000 = \( 8000C \times 1.25 \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{72,000}{8000 \times 1.25} \).

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**
   - \( C = \frac{72,000}{10,000} = Rs. 7.2 \).

Therefore, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.

The correct answer is (B) Rs. 7.2.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions of the problem.

1. **Determine the total revenue from selling 7200 pens:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

2. **Calculate the total number of pens that need to be manufactured:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, only 90% of the manufactured pens are non-defective and can be sold.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - 90% of \( x \) = 7200 pens (since these are the non-defective pens delivered).
   - \( 0.9x = 7200 \)
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \).

3. **Determine the total manufacturing cost:**
   - The company estimates a 25% profit on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the manufacturing cost per pen.
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 8000 \times C \).
   - Profit = 25% of the total manufacturing cost.
   - Total revenue = Total manufacturing cost + Profit.
   - Rs. 72,000 = \( 8000C + 0.25 \times 8000C \).
   - Rs. 72,000 = \( 8000C \times 1.25 \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{72,000}{8000 \times 1.25} \).

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**

A)1
B)2
C)3
D)4
E)5",D,"To determine the minimum number of DVDs you need to rent to make the membership worth it, we need to compare the total cost of renting DVDs with and without the membership.

Without membership:
- Cost per DVD = $4.00

With membership:
- Monthly membership cost = $7.00
- Cost per DVD = $2.00

Let \( x \) be the number of DVDs rented in a month.

Without membership, the total cost is:
\[ 4x \]

With membership, the total cost is:
\[ 7 + 2x \]

We want to find the smallest \( x \) such that the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without membership:
\[ 7 + 2x \leq 4x \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 7 \leq 4x - 2x \]
\[ 7 \leq 2x \]
\[ x \geq \frac{7}{2} \]
\[ x \geq 3.5 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3.5 is 4.

Therefore, you need to rent at least 4 DVDs to make the membership worth it.

A)2%

Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100

We are given:
- SI = Rs. 300
- P = Rs. 5000
- T = 3 years

We need to find the rate of interest, R.

Plugging the values into the formula:

300 = 5000 × R × 3 / 100

To solve for R, we rearrange the equation:

R = (300 × 100) / (5000 × 3)

R = 30000 / 15000

R = 2

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%.
