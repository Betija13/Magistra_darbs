The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We have a car moving towards a tower at a constant speed. The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

### Step 2: Set Up the Problem

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From trigonometry, we know:
- When the angle of elevation is 45°, \(\tan(45°) = 1\), so \( h = x_1 \).
- When the angle of elevation is 60°, \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( h = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \).

### Step 3: Relate the Distances

From the above equations:
1. \( h = x_1 \)
2. \( h = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \)

Equating the two expressions for \( h \):
\[ x_1 = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Distance Traveled in 10 Minutes

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} - x_2 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

Since the car travels this distance in 10 minutes, we have:
\[ v \cdot 10 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Remaining Distance and Time

The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \). The time \( t \) it will take to cover this distance is:
\[ v \cdot t = x_2 \]

From the equation \( v \cdot 10 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \), we can express \( v \) as:
\[ v = \frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \]

Substitute this expression for \( v \) into the equation \( v \cdot t = x_2 \):
\[ \frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \cdot t = x_2 \]

Cancel \( x_2 \) from both sides:
\[ \frac{(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \cdot t = 1 \]

Solve for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

### Step 6: Rationalize the Denominator

To simplify \( t \), multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \]

The denominator simplifies to:
\[ (\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Thus:
\[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

### Conclusion

The car will take an additional \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes to reach the base of the tower. Therefore, the correct answer is:

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the item.

2. **Discounted Price:**
   - The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( 0.78x \) (since 100% - 22% = 78%).

3. **Price After Coupon:**
   - The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after applying the coupon is \( 0.78x - 20 \).

4. **Equation Based on the Problem Statement:**
   - The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
     \]
   - Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80
     \]
     \[
     1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80
     \]
   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     0.56x - 40 = 3.80
     \]
   - Add 40 to both sides:
     \[
     0.56x = 43.80
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.56 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{43.80}{0.56}
     \]
     \[
     x = 78.2142857

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12, as this will give us the smallest number that is divisible by both. 

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 9 can be expressed as \( 3^2 \).
   - 12 can be expressed as \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \).

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - The prime numbers involved are 2 and 3.
   - The highest power of 2 is \( 2^2 \).
   - The highest power of 3 is \( 3^2 \).

   Therefore, the LCM of 9 and 12 is:

Now, we know that \( X = 36 \). We need to find which of the given choices is a multiple of 36.

Let's evaluate each choice:

- **A) 36**: 36 is a multiple of 36 (since \( 36 \div 36 = 1 \)).
- **B) 15**: 15 is not a multiple of 36 (since \( 15 \div 36 \) is not an integer).

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. 

Let's define the events:
- Let \( P(A) \) be the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is 0.56.
- Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is 0.74.

We are interested in finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both stocks do not increase in value.

The probability that Stock A does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither stock increases in value, we need to consider the scenario where the events are independent. In this case, the probability that neither stock increases is the product of the probabilities that each stock does not increase:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = P(\text{A does not increase}) \times P(\text{B does not increase}) = 0.44 \times 0.26. \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.26.

C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 360
   - Profit Percentage = 20%
   - We need to find the Cost Price (CP).

2. **Extract Relevant Variables:**
   - Let CP be the cost price of the article.
   - Profit is given as 20% of CP.

3. **Formulate the Relationship:**
   - Profit = 20% of CP = 0.20 × CP
   - Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   SP = CP + 0.20 \times CP
   \]
   \[
   360 = CP + 0.20 \times CP
   \]
   \[
   360 = 1.20 \times CP

C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles \( Q \) in the bag after the described events. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We start with a bag of only white marbles. The number of marbles in the bag initially is not given, but we will denote it as \( Q \).

2. **First Event:**
   - 20 marbles are pulled out and painted black, then returned to the bag. This means there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

3. **Second Event:**
   - Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. This implies that the proportion of black marbles in this sample is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

4. **Proportion of Black Marbles:**
   - The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Therefore, the proportion of black marbles in the entire bag is also \(\frac{1}{20}\).

5. **Equation Setup:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of black marbles in the bag. We know \( B = 20 \) because 20 marbles were painted black and returned to the bag.
   - The proportion of black marbles in the bag is \(\frac{B}{Q} = \frac{1}{20}\).

6. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   - Substitute \( B = 20 \) into the proportion equation:
     \[
     \frac{20}{Q} = \frac{1}{20}

   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( Q \):
     \[
     20 \times 20 = Q
     \]
     \[
     Q = 400

The problem also asks how many letters need to be distinct, but it seems the main focus is on calculating the total number of distinct combinations.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Format:**
   - The bike number format is: **LLNN**, where:
     - **L** represents a letter.
     - **N** represents a number.

2. **Calculating the Number of Combinations:**
   - **Letters (LL):**
     - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
     - Since the problem does not specify that the letters need to be distinct, we assume they can be the same.
     - Therefore, the number of combinations for the letters is \(26 \times 26\).

   - **Numbers (NN):**
     - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration of the train considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- The train initially travels at 100 miles/hour.
- It takes 10 hours to reach the destination at this speed.
- After covering a quarter of the distance, the speed changes to 75 miles/hour due to rain.

### Step 2: Extract Relevant Variables
- Initial speed = 100 miles/hour
- Total time at initial speed = 10 hours
- Distance covered at initial speed = Speed × Time = 100 miles/hour × 10 hours = 1000 miles
- Distance covered before rain = 1/4 of total distance = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Distance
- Remaining distance after rain starts = Total distance - Distance covered before rain = 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles

### Step 4: Calculate Time for Remaining Distance
- Speed after rain starts = 75 miles/hour
- Time to cover remaining distance = Remaining distance / Speed after rain = 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours

### Step 5: Calculate Total Journey Duration
- Time to cover first quarter of the distance = Distance before rain / Initial speed = 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours
- Total journey duration = Time to cover first quarter + Time to cover remaining distance = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( P \) be the number of students who attended the prom night.
- Let \( D \) be the number of students who participated in the debating session.
- Let \( N \) be the number of students who neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session.

### Step 2: Extract Information
- Total number of students = 200
- At least 45% attended the prom night: \( P \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \)
- At least 35% participated in the debating session: \( D \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \)

### Step 3: Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
The principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets states:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]

Where:
- \( |P \cup D| \) is the number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both.
- \( |P \cap D| \) is the number of students who attended both the prom night and the debating session.

### Step 4: Calculate Maximum \( N \)
To maximize \( N \), we need to minimize \( |P \cup D| \). The minimum value of \( |P \cup D| \) occurs when the overlap \( |P \cap D| \) is maximized.

Since \( P \geq 90 \) and \( D \geq 70 \), the maximum overlap \( |P \cap D| \) can be calculated as follows:
- If all 70 students who participated in the debating session also attended the prom night, then \( |P \cap D| = 70 \).

Thus, the minimum number of students who attended either event is:
\[ |P \cup D| = P + D - |P \cap D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

### Step 5: Calculate \( N \)
The number of students who neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session is:
\[ N = 200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 90 = 110 \]

### Conclusion
The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 110.

A)4,000
B)4,200
C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Identify Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers produced were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Identify Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is the total produced minus the defective ones: \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

4. **Mistakenly Rejected Non-defective Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of mistakenly rejected non-defective staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

5. **Use Given Information:**
   - We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.018x = 72
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 0.018 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{72}{0.018}

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

**Step 1: Determine the rate of production for each machine.**

- Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

**Step 2: Determine the combined rate of production.**

To find the combined rate of production, we add the rates of Machine A and Machine B:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18.

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
\]

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ yo-yos per minute}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the time to produce 10 yo-yos.**

We need to find the time \( t \) such that the combined production equals 10 yo-yos:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{10 \times 18}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \text{ minutes}

E)None of the above",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over a 22-month period, given the sales data for two separate time frames.

**Step 1: Understand the given data**

- Last year (12 months), the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month.
- In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in each period**

- For last year (12 months):
  \[
  \text{Total sold last year} = 42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens}
  \]

- For the first 10 months of this year:

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Variables:**
   - Let \( H \) be the highest score.
   - Let \( L \) be the lowest score.
   - The average of the highest and lowest scores is given by:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x

The equation is:

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6
\]

**Step 1: Simplify the denominator**

First, simplify the denominator:

\[
13 \times 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13
\]

**Step 2: Set up the equation**

Now, substitute the simplified denominator back into the equation:

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6

**Step 3: Solve for the numerator**

Multiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 \times 13

Calculate the right side:

\[
6 \times 13 = 78

So, the equation becomes:

\[
5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 78

**Step 4: Simplify the left side**

Combine the constants on the left side:

\[
5 - 15 - 7 = -17

Divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?:

\[
? = \frac{95}{19}

E)40",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Profit Calculation:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Bag:**
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 × $100 = $25.

3. **Determine the Number of Bags Sold:**
   - Total profit made = $3,000.
   - If the profit per bag is $25, then the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.

   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} = \frac{3000}{25}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{3000}{25} = 120
   \]

Thus, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

However, it seems there is a discrepancy because 120 is not one of the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- The problem states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means the profit is calculated based on the selling price, not the cost price. The calculation above is correct, and the number of bags sold is indeed 120.

Since 120 is not listed among the choices, it appears there might be an error in the problem statement or the choices provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 120 bags.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: The solution you provided is correct in terms of the calculations, but it seems there is a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the choices given. Let's go through the problem again to ensure clarity:

1. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Bag:**
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 × $100 = $25.

3. **Determine the Number of Bags Sold:**
   - Total profit made = $3,000.
   - If the profit per bag is $25, then the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.

   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120

The calculation is correct, and the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. However, since 120 is not one of the options provided (A through E), it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the choices.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of toys made by Alex.
- Let \( J \) be the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. Alex takes 7 hours to make one toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make one toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).
4. Both worked for almost the same number of hours, so \( 7A \approx 9J \).

We can set up the equation for the hours worked:
\[ 7A = 9J \]

Now, we have a system of equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \)
2. \( 7A = 9J \)

From the second equation, solve for \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ A = \frac{9}{7}J \]

Substitute this expression for \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + J = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + \frac{7}{7}J = 35 \]
\[ \frac{16}{7}J = 35 \]

Solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 35 \times \frac{7}{16} \]
\[ J = \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J = 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number, and the problem states they worked for almost the same number of hours, we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

Therefore, Jacob made 15 toys.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea solution is 50% strong, meaning it contains 50% tea and 50% milk.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - The initial concentration of tea is 50%. 
   - After removing 15% of the solution, the remaining solution is 85% of the original.
   - The amount of tea in the remaining solution is \(0.85 \times 50\% = 42.5\%\).
   - The 15% that is removed is replaced entirely with milk, which has 0% tea.
   - Therefore, the new concentration of tea is \(42.5\%\).

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - John again replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - The concentration of tea before this replacement is 42.5%.
   - After removing 15% of the solution, the remaining solution is 85% of the current solution.
   - The amount of tea in the remaining solution is \(0.85 \times 42.5\% = 36.125\%\).
   - The 15% that is removed is replaced entirely with milk, which has 0% tea.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
   - The concentration of tea before this replacement is 36.125%.

- \(\frac{1}{16}\) of the students study math.
- \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the students study bio.
- \(\frac{1}{8}\) of the students study English.

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999. Additionally, \( N \) must be divisible by 16, 10, and 8 for the fractions to result in whole numbers of students.

To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime number appearing in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. We need to find the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

1. **Minimum 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We divide 1000 by 80:

   \[
   1000 \div 80 = 12.5

   The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13. Therefore, the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 13 = 1040

2. **Maximum 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The largest 4-digit number is 9999. We divide 9999 by 80:

   \[

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (in kilometers).
- Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

### Step 2: Use the Information Given
1. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Speed = \( v \) km/hr
   - Distance = \( d \) km

   Using the formula for distance: 
   \[
   d = v \times 6
   \]

2. **Return Journey:**
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Speed = \( v + 12 \) km/hr (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr)
   - Distance = \( d \) km (same distance as forward journey)

   Using the formula for distance:
   \[
   d = (v + 12) \times 4
   \]

### Step 3: Set Up Equations
From the forward journey:
\[
d = 6v
\]

From the return journey:
\[
d = 4(v + 12)
\]

Since both expressions equal \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
6v = 4(v + 12)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( v \)
Expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6v = 4v + 48
\]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:
\[
2v = 48
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
v = 24
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Distance
Now that we have \( v = 24 \) km/hr, substitute back into the equation for distance:
\[
d = 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144
\]

### Conclusion
The distance traveled by the jeep is \( 144 \) km.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{144 \text{ km}}

A)20%
B)28%
C)36%
D)40%

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( W \) be the wholesale cost of the appliance.
   - The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, the original retail price \( R \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
     \]

2. **Calculate the Sale Price:**
   - The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the sale price \( S \) is:
     \[
     S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R
     \]
   - Substitute the expression for \( R \) from step 1:
     \[
     S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W
     \]

3. **Determine the Percentage Increase Over Wholesale Cost:**
   - The sale price \( S \) is \( 1.28W \), which means it is 28% more than the wholesale cost \( W \).
   - To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{S - W}{W}\right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Substitute \( S = 1.28W \):

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand the situation described:

1. We have a rectangular sheet with length \( L \) and width \( W \).
2. When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
3. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.

Let's break down the problem:

### Step 1: Understand the folding

- **First folding**: If the sheet is folded along the length, each half will have dimensions \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \). The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
  \[
  2 \left(\frac{L}{2} + W\right) = 48
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  L + 2W = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

- **Second folding**: If the sheet is folded along the width, each half will have dimensions \( L \) and \( \frac{W}{2} \). The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
  \[
  2 \left(L + \frac{W}{2}\right) = 66
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  2L + W = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
  \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

We have the following system of equations:
1. \( L + 2W = 48 \)
2. \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From Equation 1:
\[ L = 48 - 2W \]

Substitute \( L = 48 - 2W \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4W + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3W = 66 \]
\[ 3W = 30 \]
\[ W = 10 \]

Now substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( L \):
\[ L + 2(10) = 48 \]
\[ L + 20 = 48 \]
\[ L = 28 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the sheet

The area \( A \) of the rectangular sheet is given by:
\[ A = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The correct equations should be:
1. \( L + 2W = 48 \)
2. \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Re-solving these equations:

From Equation 1:
\[ L = 48 - 2W \]

Substitute into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4W + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3W = 66 \]
\[ 3W = 30 \]
\[ W = 10 \]

Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ L + 20 = 48 \]
\[ L = 28 \]

The area of the sheet is:
\[ A = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \]

A)Rs. 697.50
B)Rs. 712.50
C)Rs. 787.50
D)Rs. 750
E)Rs. 780",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the watch. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

1. **Discounts and Profit:**
   - The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount and earns a certain profit.
   - If the discount is increased to 7%, the profit decreases by Rs. 15.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the marked price of the watch.

### Step 2: Define Variables

- Let \( M \) be the marked price of the watch.
- Let \( C \) be the cost price of the watch.
- Profit when a 5% discount is given: \( P_1 = M \times 0.95 - C \)
- Profit when a 7% discount is given: \( P_2 = M \times 0.93 - C \)

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation

According to the problem, the difference in profit between the two scenarios is Rs. 15:

\[
P_1 - P_2 = 15
\]

Substitute the expressions for \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \):

\[
(M \times 0.95 - C) - (M \times 0.93 - C) = 15
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
M \times 0.95 - M \times 0.93 = 15
\]

\[
M \times (0.95 - 0.93) = 15
\]

\[
M \times 0.02 = 15

B)2520
C)1728
D)1656
E)None",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the original number based on the information given about the student's mistake.

Let's denote the original number as \( x \).

1. **Correct Calculation**: The correct calculation should have been finding \( \frac{7}{8} \) of the number. So, the correct value is:
   \[
   \frac{7}{8} \times x
   \]

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The student mistakenly calculated \( \frac{7}{18} \) of the number. So, the incorrect value is:
   \[
   \frac{7}{18} \times x
   \]

3. **Difference**: According to the problem, the difference between the correct and incorrect values is 770. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

1. **Understand the Salary Structure:**
   - The shop assistant has a fixed salary of $500.
   - In addition to the fixed salary, she earns 5% of her monthly sales.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the monthly sales.
   - The total salary \( S \) is given by the formula:
     \[
     S = 500 + 0.05x
     \]
   - We want the total salary \( S \) to be $1500. Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     500 + 0.05x = 1500
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 500 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     0.05x = 1500 - 500

39,,"An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field?
A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the average speed of the aeroplane as it flies around the four sides of a square. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square, each side at different speeds: 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr. We need to find the average speed for the entire journey around the square.

### Step 2: Extract Relevant Variables
- Let the length of each side of the square be \( s \).
- Total distance traveled = \( 4s \) (since there are four sides).
- Speeds for each side: \( v_1 = 200 \) km/hr, \( v_2 = 400 \) km/hr, \( v_3 = 600 \) km/hr, \( v_4 = 800 \) km/hr.

### Step 3: Calculate Time Taken for Each Side
The time taken to travel each side is given by the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).

- Time for side 1: \( t_1 = \frac{s}{200} \)
- Time for side 2: \( t_2 = \frac{s}{400} \)
- Time for side 3: \( t_3 = \frac{s}{600} \)
- Time for side 4: \( t_4 = \frac{s}{800} \)

### Step 4: Calculate Total Time
Total time \( T \) is the sum of the times for each side:
\[ T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800} \]

### Step 5: Simplify the Total Time Expression
To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400.

Convert each fraction:
- \( \frac{s}{200} = \frac{12s}{2400} \)
- \( \frac{s}{400} = \frac{6s}{2400} \)
- \( \frac{s}{600} = \frac{4s}{2400} \)
- \( \frac{s}{800} = \frac{3s}{2400} \)

Add them up:
\[ T = \frac{12s}{2400} + \frac{6s}{2400} + \frac{4s}{2400} + \frac{3s}{2400} = \frac{25s}{2400} \]

### Step 6: Calculate Average Speed
Average speed \( V_{\text{avg}} \) is given by:
\[ V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{4s}{\frac{25s}{2400}} \]

Simplify:
\[ V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{4s \times 2400}{25s} = \frac{9600s}{25s} = 384 \text{ km/hr} \]

### Step 7: Conclusion
The average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of white sharpeners.
- \( y \) as the number of brown sharpeners.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, so:
   \[
   x + y = 18
   \]

2. The total cost of the sharpeners is Rs. 100. If each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener, we can express the cost of each sharpener as:
   - Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( b \) rupees.
   - Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

   The total cost equation is:
   \[
   x(b + 1) + yb = 100
   \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( xb + x + yb = 100 \)

Substitute \( y = 18 - x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
x(b + 1) + (18 - x)b = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
xb + x + 18b - xb = 100
\]
\[
x + 18b = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 100 - 18b
\]

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are integers, \( 100 - 18b \) must also be an integer. We also know that \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, and \( x + y = 18 \).

Let's test the options given:

- **Option A: \( x = 10, y = 8 \)**
  - \( x + y = 10 + 8 = 18 \) (satisfies the first equation)
  - Substitute into the cost equation:
    \[
    10(b + 1) + 8b = 100
    \]
    \[
    10b + 10 + 8b = 100
    \]
    \[
    18b + 10 = 100
    \]
    \[
    18b = 90
    \]
    \[
    b = 5
    \]
  - The cost of each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, and each white sharpener is 6 rupees. This satisfies all conditions.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then use that information to find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let the rate of hose A be \( r_A \) pools per hour.
- Let the rate of hose B be \( r_B \) pools per hour.

### Step 2: Information from the Problem
- Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so \( r_A = \frac{1}{8} \) pools per hour.
- Hose A works alone for 2 hours, filling \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.
- Together, hoses A and B fill the remaining \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation for Combined Work
When hoses A and B work together, their combined rate is \( r_A + r_B \). They fill \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours, so:
\[
3(r_A + r_B) = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r_B \)
Substitute \( r_A = \frac{1}{8} \) into the equation:
\[
3\left(\frac{1}{8} + r_B\right) = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
\frac{1}{8} + r_B = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Subtract \(\frac{1}{8}\) from both sides:
\[
r_B = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Time for Hose B Alone
Since \( r_B = \frac{1}{8} \) pools per hour, it would take hose B:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1}{r_B} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion
The time it would take for hose B to fill the pool alone is 8 hours.

E)None of these",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must achieve to reach a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees, given his base salary and commission rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Known Values:**
   - Monthly salary of the servant = 1500 Rupees
   - Commission rate = 15% of the monthly sales
   - Desired total monthly income = 6000 Rupees

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( S \) be the monthly sales in Rupees.
   - The commission earned from sales is \( 0.15 \times S \).
   - The total income is the sum of the base salary and the commission:
     \[
     \text{Total Income} = \text{Base Salary} + \text{Commission}
     \]
     \[
     6000 = 1500 + 0.15 \times S
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Subtract the base salary from the total income to find the income from commission:
     \[
     6000 - 1500 = 0.15 \times S
     \]
     \[
     4500 = 0.15 \times S
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{4500}{0.15}
     \]
     \[
     S = 30000

E)12%",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

- **Principal (P):** Rs. 360 (the amount borrowed)
- **Monthly Installment:** Rs. 31.50
- **Number of Installments (n):** 12 months
- **Total Amount Paid:** 12 installments × Rs. 31.50 per installment

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Paid

\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = 12 \times 31.50 = Rs. 378

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Interest Paid

\[
\text{Total Interest Paid} = \text{Total Amount Paid} - \text{Principal} = 378 - 360 = Rs. 18
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Monthly Interest Rate

The total interest of Rs. 18 is paid over 12 months. To find the monthly interest rate, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 360)
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (which we need to find)
- \( t \) is the time period in years (1 year in this case, since 12 months = 1 year)

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{\text{Simple Interest} \times 100}{P \times t}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
r = \frac{18 \times 100}{360 \times 1} = \frac{1800}{360} = 5\%

   - The original price of the product is considered as 100%.
   - The price is reduced by 30%, so the new price is 70% of the original price.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the original price be \( P \).
   - After a 30% reduction, the new price is \( 0.7P \).

3. **Determine the Required Increase:**
   - We need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price from \( 0.7P \) back to \( P \).

4. **Calculate the Increase:**
   - The increase needed is \( P - 0.7P = 0.3P \).

5. **Calculate the Percentage Increase:**
   - The percentage increase is calculated based on the reduced price, \( 0.7P \).
   - Percentage increase = \(\left(\frac{0.3P}{0.7P}\right) \times 100\%\)

6. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{0.3P}{0.7P} = \frac{0.3}{0.7} = \frac{3}{7}
   \]
   - Convert \(\frac{3}{7}\) to a percentage:
   \[
   \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]
   - Therefore, the percentage increase is:
   \[
   0.4286 \times 100\% = 42.86\%
   \]

7. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The correct choice is B) 42.86%.

Thus, the price should be increased by 42.86% to return to the original price.

How many of each are there?
A)453
B)651
C)400
D)487
E)286",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins of each type are in the money pouch. We know that there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins, and the total value of these coins is Rs. 700.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of each type of coin (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee).

2. **Convert Rupees to Paise:**
   - Rs. 700 is equivalent to 70000 paise (since 1 rupee = 100 paise).

3. **Calculate the Total Value in Paise:**
   - The value of \( x \) 25 paise coins is \( 25x \) paise.
   - The value of \( x \) 50 paise coins is \( 50x \) paise.
   - The value of \( x \) 1 rupee coins is \( 100x \) paise.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total value of all the coins is the sum of the values of each type of coin:
     \[
     25x + 50x + 100x = 70000
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     175x = 70000
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 175 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{70000}{175} = 400
     \]

Therefore, there are 400 coins of each type (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee).

A)Rs. 4400
B)Rs. 4270
C)Rs. 4000
D)Rs. 3937.50
E)None of these",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's monthly income based on his spending and savings rate. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- The man spends Rs. 3500 per month.
- He saves 12.5% of his income.
- We need to find his total monthly income.

### Step 2: Define Variables
- Let \( I \) be the man's monthly income.
- He spends Rs. 3500, which means his savings are the remaining part of his income.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
- The savings rate is 12.5%, which can be expressed as a fraction: \( \frac{12.5}{100} = \frac{1}{8} \).
- Therefore, the savings amount is \( \frac{1}{8} \times I \).
- The rest of his income, which is spent, is \( I - \frac{1}{8}I = \frac{7}{8}I \).

### Step 4: Relate Spending to Income
- We know that the amount he spends is Rs. 3500.
- Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
  \[
  \frac{7}{8}I = 3500
  \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( I \)
- To find \( I \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{8}{7} \):
  \[
  I = 3500 \times \frac{8}{7}
  \]
- Calculate the right-hand side:
  \[
  I = 3500 \times \frac{8}{7} = 3500 \times 1.142857 \approx 4000
  \]

### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
- If the income is Rs. 4000, then savings should be \( \frac{1}{8} \times 4000 = 500 \).
- The spending would then be \( 4000 - 500 = 3500 \), which matches the given spending.

### Conclusion
The man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"PLAN: To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem:
- \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges)
- \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges to choose)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the \( 8! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \times 8!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1}

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the painting of the 3 houses after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have done their parts.

### Step 1: Determine the work rates of each painter.

- **Mr. Brown** can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
- **Mr. Black** can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
- **Mr. Blue** can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days.

Mr. Brown works for 8 days before going on vacation. The amount of work he completes is:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ houses} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days.

After Mr. Brown goes on vacation, Mr. Black works for 6 days. The amount of work he completes is:
\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black.

The total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black is:
\[ \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator:
- The least common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12.

Convert the fractions:
\[ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \]

Add the fractions:
\[ \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \text{ houses} \]

### Step 5: Determine the remaining work to be done by Mr. Blue.

The total work required is 3 houses. The remaining work after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black is:
\[ 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \text{ houses} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the time it takes for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work.

Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day. To complete \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take him:
\[ \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \text{ days} \]

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the hollow cube and determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface is painted.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

1. **Outer Cube Dimensions**: The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm.
2. **Thickness of the Cube**: The thickness of the hollow cube is 1 cm.
3. **Inner Cube Dimensions**: Since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner cube (hollow part) will have a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm.
4. **Smaller Cube Size**: Each smaller cube has a side length of 1 cm.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Smaller Cubes

1. **Total Smaller Cubes in the Outer Cube**: The outer cube is 5 cm on each side, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
2. **Smaller Cubes in the Inner Cube (Hollow Part)**: The inner hollow part is 3 cm on each side, so it contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Structure**: The hollow structure is the outer cube minus the inner cube, so it contains \(125 - 27 = 98\) smaller cubes.

### Step 3: Determine Painted and Unpainted Faces

1. **Painted Faces**: All the outer surfaces of the hollow cube are painted. This means that any smaller cube on the outer surface will have some of its faces painted.
2. **Unpainted Faces**: We need to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.

### Step 4: Calculate Unpainted Faces

1. **Inner Smaller Cubes**: The inner 3x3x3 cube is completely unpainted, so it contributes \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces (since each cube has 6 faces).
2. **Outer Layer Contribution**: The outer layer of the hollow cube is 1 cm thick, and only the faces that are not exposed to the outside will remain unpainted.

3. **Unpainted Faces of the Hollow Structure**: 
   - The hollow structure has 98 smaller cubes.
   - Each smaller cube in the hollow structure has 1 face unpainted (the face that is towards the inside of the hollow cube).

4. **Total Unpainted Faces**: 
   - Inner cube unpainted faces: 162
   - Hollow structure unpainted faces: 98

   Total unpainted faces = 162 + 98 = 260

### Conclusion

The total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is 260. However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or choices, as none of the options match this calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Upon re-evaluation, the correct interpretation should be:

- The inner 3x3x3 cube contributes 162 unpainted faces.
- The hollow structure contributes 6 unpainted faces per cube for the 27 inner cubes, and 1 unpainted face for each of the 98 hollow structure cubes.

Thus, the correct total is 162 + 98 = 260 unpainted faces.

However, the problem might be asking for something different, or there might be a mistake in the options provided. Based on the given options, the closest logical answer would be:

1. **Identify the total percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - We are given that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates must be vanilla flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

3. **Calculate the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the rest (which are vanilla flavored) are squashed.
   - So, 90% of the 90% vanilla chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla chocolates.

4. **Find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla chocolates, the remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% (total vanilla) - 81% (squashed vanilla) = 9% of the total chocolates are vanilla flavored and not squashed.

B)91
C)41

E)44",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find five consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. We also need to determine which of the given options could be one of these numbers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define the Consecutive Odd Numbers:**
   Let the five consecutive odd numbers be \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \).

2. **Calculate the Sum:**
   The sum of these numbers is:
   \[
   n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20
   \]

3. **Condition for Perfect Square:**
   We need \( \frac{5n + 20}{10} \) to be a perfect square. Simplifying this expression:
   \[
   \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}
   \]
   Let \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Therefore:
   \[
   n + 4 = 2k^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 2k^2 - 4
   \]

4. **Determine the Range for \( n \):**
   Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, it must satisfy:
   \[
   10 \leq n \leq 99
   \]
   Substituting \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \), we get:
   \[
   10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99
   \]
   Solving these inequalities:
   \[
   14 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103
   \]
   \[
   7 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5
   \]
   Therefore, \( k \) can be an integer such that \( 3 \leq k \leq 7 \).

5. **Calculate Possible Values of \( n \):**
   - For \( k = 3 \): \( n = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) (not odd)
   - For \( k = 4 \): \( n = 2(4)^2 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \) (not odd)
   - For \( k = 5 \): \( n = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \) (not odd)
   - For \( k = 6 \): \( n = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \) (not odd)
   - For \( k = 7 \): \( n = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \) (not odd)

   Since none of these values are odd, let's check the odd numbers around these values:
   - For \( k = 3 \): \( n = 15 \)
   - For \( k = 4 \): \( n = 27 \)
   - For \( k = 5 \): \( n = 45 \)
   - For \( k = 6 \): \( n = 67 \)
   - For \( k = 7 \): \( n = 95 \)

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( Q \) be the age of Q.
2. Let \( R \) be the age of R.
3. Let \( T \) be the age of T.

According to the problem, ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ R - Q = Q - T \]

This equation implies that the difference in age between R and Q is the same as the difference in age between Q and T.

We can rearrange the equation to find:
\[ R - Q = Q - T \]
\[ R + T = 2Q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ R + T = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( R + T = 50 \)
2. \( R + T = 2Q \)

From these two equations, we can equate them:
\[ 50 = 2Q \]

Solving for \( Q \), we get:
\[ Q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( R - Q \).

Since \( R + T = 50 \) and \( R + T = 2Q = 50 \), we can substitute \( Q = 25 \) into the equation:
\[ R + T = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms that our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find the specific values of \( R \) and \( T \) to determine \( R - Q \).

From the equation \( R + T = 50 \) and knowing \( Q = 25 \), we can use the equation \( R - Q = Q - T \) to find:
\[ R - 25 = 25 - T \]
\[ R + T = 50 \]

Substituting \( T = 50 - R \) into the equation \( R - 25 = 25 - T \):
\[ R - 25 = 25 - (50 - R) \]
\[ R - 25 = 25 - 50 + R \]
\[ R - 25 = R - 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means we cannot determine a specific value for \( R - Q \) without additional information. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be definitely determined.

A)11.75 miles
B)12.75 miles
C)17.75 miles
D)14.75 miles
E)10.75 miles",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how far you can travel with $8.50 given the cab's pricing structure. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Pricing Structure
- The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
- After the first quarter-mile, the cab charges an additional $0.10 for each subsequent quarter-mile.

### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Money After the Initial Charge
- You start with $8.50.
- The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.
- Subtract the initial charge from the total money:  
  \[
  8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00
  \]
  You have $5.00 remaining after the first quarter-mile.

### Step 3: Calculate How Many Additional Quarter-Miles You Can Travel
- Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10.
- With $5.00, calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can afford:  
  \[
  \frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \text{ additional quarter-miles}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Distance
- The first quarter-mile is already covered by the initial $3.50.
- You can travel 50 additional quarter-miles with the remaining $5.00.
- Total quarter-miles traveled:  
  \[
  1 + 50 = 51 \text{ quarter-miles}
  \]
- Convert quarter-miles to miles:  
  \[
  \frac{51}{4} = 12.75 \text{ miles}

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find out the total number of matches Sachin played in the season before the finals. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Sachin's current batting average before the finals is 51.
   - In the finals, he scores 78 runs.
   - After the finals, his batting average becomes 54.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of matches Sachin played before the finals.
   - Let \( T \) be the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - The batting average before the finals is given by:
     \[
     \frac{T}{n} = 51
     \]
     Therefore, \( T = 51n \).

   - After scoring 78 runs in the finals, the total runs become \( T + 78 \), and the total number of matches becomes \( n + 1 \).

   - The new batting average after the finals is given by:
     \[
     \frac{T + 78}{n + 1} = 54
     \]

4. **Substitute and solve the equations:**
   - Substitute \( T = 51n \) into the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54
     \]

   - Multiply both sides by \( n + 1 \) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)
     \]

   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     51n + 78 = 54n + 54
     \]

   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     78 - 54 = 54n - 51n
     \]
     \[
     24 = 3n
     \]

   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     n = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of matches:**
   - The total number of matches played by Sachin in the season, including the finals, is \( n + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 9.

The correct answer is **C) 9**.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
A)3

C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, meaning that a pair like ""AB"" is the same as ""BA"".

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use a single letter to represent a book type, each letter can represent one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can represent \( n \) book types with single letters.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, the number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is because the order of letters in a pair does not matter.

3. **Total Codes**: The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of the single letter codes and the pair of letters codes:
   \[
   \text{Total Codes} = n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

We need this total to be at least 10, as there are 10 different types of books.

Let's calculate the total number of codes for different values of \( n \):

- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 3 + \binom{3}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
  This is not enough, as we need at least 10 codes.

- **For \( n = 4 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 4 + \binom{4}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10
  \]
  This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **For \( n = 5 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 5 + \binom{5}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15
  \]
  This is more than enough, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) gives us exactly 10 codes, which is the minimum required, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\).

65,,"A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land given its area and a relationship between its length and breadth.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( b \) be the breadth of the rectangle in meters.
- According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
  \[
  l = 4b + 1
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Area Formula
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth}
\]
Given that the area is 150 square meters, we can write:
\[
l \times b = 150
\]
Substitute the expression for \( l \) from Step 1:
\[
(4b + 1) \times b = 150
\]

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
Expand and simplify the equation:
\[
4b^2 + b = 150
\]
Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation:
\[
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
\]

### Step 4: Solve the Quadratic Equation
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
\]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
\]

Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can find the roots:
\[
b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8}
\]
\[
b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative)

Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters.

### Step 5: Calculate the Length
Using the expression for length:
\[
l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2(l + b)
\]
Substitute the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
\[
P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters}
\]

The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 62 meters. Therefore, the correct choice is:

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of grams of the health food consumed daily.

From the problem, we know:
- Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
- Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.

We need to ensure that the total intake of each vitamin meets or exceeds 100% of the daily requirement.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   \[
   9\% \times x \geq 100\%
   \]
   \[
   0.09x \geq 1
   \]
   \[
   x \geq \frac{1}{0.09} \approx 11.11

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   \[
   8\% \times x \geq 100\%
   \]
   \[
   0.08x \geq 1
   \]
   \[
   x \geq \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5

To satisfy both requirements, we need the greater of the two values calculated:
- For vitamin E, \( x \geq 11.11 \)

A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to meet the demand for both large and small cakes within the given time frame.

**Step 1: Understand the requirements**

- We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the total work needed**

- **Large cakes:** We need 20 large cakes. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, the total hours needed for large cakes is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours for large cakes} = \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{2 \text{ large cakes/hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Small cakes:** We need 700 small cakes. Since each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, the total hours needed for small cakes is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours for small cakes} = \frac{700 \text{ small cakes}}{35 \text{ small cakes/hour}} = 20 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours of work needed**

The total hours of work needed is the sum of the hours needed for large cakes and small cakes:
\[
\text{Total hours of work} = 10 \text{ hours (large cakes)} + 20 \text{ hours (small cakes)} = 30 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the number of helpers required**

Each helper works for 3 hours (since the kitchen is available for 3 hours). Therefore, the total number of helper-hours available is:
\[
\text{Total helper-hours available} = \text{Number of helpers} \times 3 \text{ hours}
\]

We need 30 total hours of work, so:
\[
\text{Number of helpers} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ hours}
\]

Solving for the number of helpers:
\[
\text{Number of helpers} = \frac{30 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours/helper}} = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of helpers required is 10.

A)6
B)7
C)8
D)9
E)10",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand the positions of the points R, S, T, and U on a line and use the given information to find the length of the line segment RU.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Extract Information

- We have points R, S, T, and U on a line.
- U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
- The lengths of the line segments are:
  - RS = 5
  - RT = 17
  - ST = 22

### Step 2: Set Up the Problem

Let's place these points on a number line for clarity:

1. Assume point R is at position 0 on the number line.
2. Since RS = 5, point S is at position 5.
3. Since RT = 17, point T is at position 17.
4. Since ST = 22, the distance from S to T is 22, which is consistent with S at 5 and T at 17 (since 17 - 5 = 12, not 22, we need to adjust our understanding).

### Step 3: Correct Understanding of ST

Given ST = 22, and S is at 5, T should be at 5 + 22 = 27.

### Step 4: Find U

Since U is the midpoint of ST, we calculate the midpoint of S (5) and T (27):

\[ U = \frac{S + T}{2} = \frac{5 + 27}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

So, U is at position 16 on the number line.

### Step 5: Calculate RU

Now, we need to find the length of RU:

- R is at position 0.
- U is at position 16.

Therefore, the length of RU is:

\[ RU = U - R = 16 - 0 = 16 \]

However, this doesn't match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

### Re-evaluation

1. R is at 0.
2. S is at 5.
3. T is at 27 (since ST = 22 and S is at 5).
4. U, the midpoint of ST, is at 16.

The calculation of RU was correct, but the choices provided do not include 16. Let's check the setup again:

- If R is at 0, S at 5, and T at 27, then U at 16 is correct.

The problem might have a typo in the choices or setup. Based on the correct calculation, the length of RU is 16, but since this is not an option, let's verify the setup:

- If we assume a different setup or error in the problem, the closest logical choice based on typical midpoint problems would be to re-evaluate the midpoint calculation or check for any misinterpretation.

Given the setup and calculations, the correct length of RU should be 16, but since this is not an option, the problem might have a misprint or error in the choices. Based on the given choices, none match the correct calculation.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we have the correct understanding and calculations.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position the Points:**
   - Assume point R is at position 0 on a number line.
   - Since RS = 5, point S is at position 5.
   - Since RT = 17, point T is at position 17.

2. **Check the Consistency of ST:**
   - Given ST = 22, and S is at 5, T should be at 5 + 22 = 27. However, this contradicts RT = 17. Let's re-evaluate:
   - If T is at 17, then ST = 17 - 5 = 12, which is incorrect. Therefore, the initial assumption about the positions might need adjustment.

3. **Re-evaluate the Setup:**
   - Let's assume S is at position 0 (instead of R), then:
     - R is at position -5 (since RS = 5).
     - T is at position 22 (since ST = 22).

4. **Find U:**
   - U is the midpoint of ST, so:
   \[
   U = \frac{S + T}{2} = \frac{0 + 22}{2} = 11
   \]

5. **Calculate RU:**
   - R is at position -5.
   - U is at position 11.
   - Therefore, the length of RU is:
   \[
   RU = U - R = 11 - (-5) = 11 + 5 = 16
   \]

Upon re-evaluation, the length of RU is indeed 16, which still does not match any of the given choices. However, if we consider the possibility of a misinterpretation or error in the problem setup, let's try another approach:

### Alternative Setup:

- Assume R is at position 0.
- S is at position 5.
- T is at position 27 (since ST = 22).

Now, calculate U:

- U is the midpoint of ST:
  \[
  U = \frac{S + T}{2} = \frac{5 + 27}{2} = 16
  \]

- Calculate RU:
  \[
  RU = U - R = 16 - 0 = 16
  \]

Given the consistent result of 16, it seems there might be an error in the problem's choices. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest logical choice based on typical midpoint problems would be to re-evaluate the midpoint calculation or check for any misinterpretation.

- Let \( P \) be the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- Let \( R \) be the amount of falafel in one roll.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of falafel in one baguette.

Now, let's translate the given information into equations:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This can be expressed as:
\[
2B = xP

Let's solve the equations step by step:

**Step 1: Solve for \( R \) in terms of \( P \) from the first equation:**
\[
6P = 2R \implies R = 3P

**Step 2: Substitute \( R = 3P \) into the second equation:**
\[
3R = 5B \implies 3(3P) = 5B \implies 9P = 5B

**Step 3: Solve for \( B \) in terms of \( P \):**
\[
B = \frac{9}{5}P

**Step 4: Substitute \( B = \frac{9}{5}P \) into the equation \( 2B = xP \):**
\[
2\left(\frac{9}{5}P\right) = xP \implies \frac{18}{5}P = xP

   - The discounted price is \( 0.8P \) (since 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price).

3. **Determine the Required Increase**:
   - To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.8P \), we need to find the percentage increase from \( 0.8P \) to \( P \).

4. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - The difference between the original price and the discounted price is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).
   - The percentage increase needed is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2}{0.8}\right) \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
     \]

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price.

D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the fence in feet, given the width of each picket and the space between them.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Understand the Components:**
   - Each picket is \( \frac{1}{2} \) inch wide.
   - There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
   - There are \( x \) pickets in total.

2. **Calculate the Total Length in Inches:**
   - The total width of the pickets is \( x \times \frac{1}{2} \) inches.
   - The number of spaces between the pickets is \( x - 1 \) (since the space is only between pickets).
   - The total space between the pickets is \( (x - 1) \times 6 \) inches.

3. **Total Length of the Fence in Inches:**
   - Add the total width of the pickets and the total space between them:
   \[
   \text{Total length in inches} = x \times \frac{1}{2} + (x - 1) \times 6

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( v \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
- The speed of the plane is \( 10v \) (10 times the speed of the ship).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. We need to find the distance from the starting point where they meet.

**Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the ship and plane to meet.**

Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.

- In time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( vt \).
- In the same time \( t \), the plane travels a distance of \( 10vt \).

Since the ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts, the total distance traveled by the ship when they meet is \( 180 + vt \).

At the meeting point, the distances traveled by the ship and the plane from the starting point are equal:
\[ 180 + vt = 10vt \]

**Step 2: Solve for \( t \).**

Rearrange the equation:
\[ 180 + vt = 10vt \]
\[ 180 = 10vt - vt \]
\[ 180 = 9vt \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9v} \]
\[ t = \frac{20}{v} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the distance from the starting point when they meet.**

The distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance traveled by the ship, which is:
\[ 180 + vt \]

Substitute \( t = \frac{20}{v} \) into the equation:
\[ vt = v \times \frac{20}{v} = 20 \]

So, the total distance from the starting point is:
\[ 180 + 20 = 200 \]

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when the ship and the plane meet is 200 miles.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. The idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample should be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

**Step 1: Understand the problem and set up the proportion**

- In 2001, 300 deer were tagged.
- In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of these were tagged.

We assume that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample (20 out of 500) is the same as the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

**Step 2: Set up the proportion equation**

Let \( N \) be the total deer population in the forest. The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is \(\frac{300}{N}\).

The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is \(\frac{20}{500}\).

Since these proportions are equal, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{300}{N} = \frac{20}{500}
\]

**Step 3: Solve the equation**

To solve for \( N \), cross-multiply:

\[
300 \times 500 = 20 \times N
\]

\[
150000 = 20N

Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{150000}{20} = 7500

Let:
- \( A \) be the amount of money Arjun has.
- \( S \) be the amount of money Sajal has.

We have two conditions given in the problem:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
   - Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).
   - According to the condition: \( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \).

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - After giving $10, Sajal will have \( S - 10 \).
   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - According to the condition: \( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \).

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

### Equation 1:
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
\[ S = 2A - 60 - 30 \]
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]

### Equation 2:
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]
\[ A = 3S - 30 - 10 \]
\[ A = 3S - 40 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]

Rearrange to solve for \( A \):
\[ 310 = 6A - A \]
\[ 310 = 5A \]
\[ A = \frac{310}{5} \]
\[ A = 62 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 62 \) back into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]
\[ S = 124 - 90 \]
\[ S = 34 \]

Thus, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

   \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
   \]
   \[
   s \times (s - 4) = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula: \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   \[
   s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
   \]

   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     - \( s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \)
     - \( s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10 \) (not possible since length cannot be negative)

7. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The side of the original square is \( s = 14 \) feet.
   - The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand that the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, and it is reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the new length of the ribbon is 3 parts out of the original 5 parts.

Let's break down the steps to solve this:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, the new length is 3 parts. 

2. **Calculate the Length of One Part**: 
   - The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, which corresponds to 5 parts.
   - Therefore, the length of one part is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of one part} = \frac{\text{Original length}}{\text{Total parts in original ratio}} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{5} = 6 \text{ cm}
     \]

3. **Calculate the New Length**:
   - The new length corresponds to 3 parts of the original 5 parts.
   - Therefore, the new length is:
     \[
     \text{New length} = \text{Length of one part} \times \text{Number of parts in new ratio} = 6 \text{ cm} \times 3 = 18 \text{ cm}

85,,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"PLAN: To solve the problem, we need to express the three-digit numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of the digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We are also given the conditions:
1. \( M > N \)
2. \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

Let's first express \( M - N \):

\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation \( M - N + 396c = 990 \):

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]

\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:

\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Now, solve for \( a \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
a = 10 - 3c
\]

Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we need to find valid integer values for \( c \) such that \( a \) is also a valid digit (0 to 9).

Let's find the possible values for \( c \):

- If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(0) = 10 \) (not valid since \( a \) must be a digit)
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 4 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(4) = -2 \) (not valid)

Thus, the valid pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

Now, calculate \( M \) for each valid pair:

1. For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b
   \]
   Since \( M > N \), \( 701 + 10b > 107 + 10b \), which is always true for \( b \) being any digit.

2. For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b
   \]
   Since \( M > N \), \( 402 + 10b > 204 + 10b \), which is always true for \( b \) being any digit.

3. For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\):
   \[
   M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b
   \]
   Since \( M > N \), \( 103 + 10b > 301 + 10b \), which is not possible for any \( b \).

Now, count the number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300:

- For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 701 + 10b \) (all values are more than 300)
- For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 402 + 10b \) (all values are more than 300)

Each valid pair of \((a, c)\) allows \( b \) to be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values for each pair.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is:

\[
10 \text{ (for } (7, 1) \text{) } + 10 \text{ (for } (4, 2) \text{) } = 20

A)550
B)570
C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the least possible number of students in the school given the percentages of students taking only physics and only math.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school.
- 20% of the students took only physics, so the number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \).
- 28% of the students took only math, so the number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).

Since we are looking for the least possible number of students, we need to ensure that the total number of students who took only physics and only math does not exceed the total number of students, \( N \). However, since these are percentages of the total, they will always sum to less than or equal to 100% of \( N \).

The problem states that there are more than 501 students in the school. Therefore, \( N > 501 \).

Now, let's calculate the least possible value of \( N \) that satisfies the given conditions and is one of the provided choices.

1. Calculate the total percentage of students who took only physics and only math:
   \[
   0.2N + 0.28N = 0.48N

2. Since \( N > 501 \), we need to find the smallest \( N \) from the choices that is greater than 501 and satisfies the condition that \( 0.48N \) is a valid number of students (i.e., an integer).

Let's check each choice:

- **A) 550**: 
  \[
  0.48 \times 550 = 264
  \]
  This is an integer, and 550 is greater than 501.

- **B) 570**:

- **D) 700**: 
  \[
  0.48 \times 700 = 336
  \]
  This is an integer.

- **E) none of these**: This option is not needed since we found valid integers in the choices.

The smallest \( N \) that satisfies all conditions and is an integer is 550. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We know that Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be Rahim's current age.
   - Five years ago, Raj's age was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{3} \times (R - 5)
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     36 = R - 5

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area at a rate of 10 square feet per day.

### Step 1: Determine the Grazing Area

The cow is tethered with a 14-foot long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[
A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
\]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[
A \approx 3.14 \times 196
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
A \approx 3.14 \times 196 = 615.44 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate:

\[
\text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} = 61.544
\]

Since the cow cannot graze a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take approximately 62 days for the cow to graze the entire field.

### Conclusion

The closest choice to 62 days is 61 days. Therefore, the answer is:

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

### Step 1: Determine the Cost Price
The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means that the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP).

Let's denote the cost price as \( CP \).

Given:
\[ SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP \]

We know:
\[ SP = 27.50 \]

So,
\[ 1.10 \times CP = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price:
\[ CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} \]

\[ CP = 25.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75
Now, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

New Selling Price (SP') = Rs. 25.75

Profit or Loss = SP' - CP
\[ = 25.75 - 25.00 \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Since the result is positive, it indicates a profit.

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit Percentage
Profit Percentage = \(\left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100\)

\[ = \left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 \]

\[ = 3\% \]

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.

E)6",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan is to the left of Tim.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of arrangements without any conditions.**

Since there are 3 children and 3 chairs, the total number of ways to arrange the children is given by the factorial of the number of children:

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

**Step 2: Apply the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim.**

For any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan. Since these two scenarios are equally likely, exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim.

Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. Let's denote:

- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. For 540 calls, the total bill is Rs.1800.
2. For 620 calls, the total bill is Rs.2040.

We can set up the following equations based on these scenarios:

1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

We have two equations with two unknowns, \( F \) and \( V \). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]

\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]

\[
80V = 240
\]

\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Let's use the first equation:

\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]

\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have determined that the fixed part of the bill \( F \) is Rs.180 and the variable cost per call \( V \) is Rs.3.

For the month where 500 calls are made, the bill would be:

\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]

\[
= 180 + 1500

\[
= 1680

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680.

**Step 1: Determine the time for one full rotation for each ball.**

- **Ball A:** 
  - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
  - Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball A is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.

- **Ball B:** 
  - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
  - Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball B is \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

**Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times.**

- We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes.

- Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 
  \[
  \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes}
  \]

**Step 3: Convert the LCM into hours and minutes.**

- 91 minutes can be converted into hours and minutes:

A)10
B)15
C)18
D)20

- Total number of books: 45
- Number of hardcover books: 30
- Number of fiction books: 20

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the set of hardcover books.
- \( F \) as the set of fiction books.

We are looking for the maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:
\[ |H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \]

We know:
- \( |H \cup F| \leq 45 \) (since there are 45 books in total)
- \( |H| = 30 \)
- \( |F| = 20 \)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]
\[ 30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]
\[ 50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]

Solving for \( |H \cap F| \), we find:
\[ 50 - 45 \leq |H \cap F| \]
\[ 5 \leq |H \cap F| \]

This inequality tells us that the minimum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5. However, we are interested in the maximum number.

To find the maximum, consider that the total number of fiction books is 20. The maximum number of fiction books that can also be hardcover is all 20 of them, provided that there are enough hardcover books to accommodate this. Since there are 30 hardcover books, it is possible for all 20 fiction books to be hardcover.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys each day from Monday to Saturday.
   - On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers as it does on the other days, so it buys \( 2x \) newspapers.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - From Monday to Saturday, the cost per newspaper is $1. Therefore, the cost for these six days is \( 6x \times 1 = 6x \) dollars.
   - On Sunday, the cost per newspaper is $4. Therefore, the cost for Sunday is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \) dollars.

3. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for Monday to Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     6x + 8x = 14x

   x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
   \]

7. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
   \]
   - This gives two potential solutions: \( x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) and \( x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8 \).

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the valid solution is \( x = 12 \).

9. **Determine the Number of Attendees:**
   - The number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( \boxed{8} \).

A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a wire initially shaped as a rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm.
   - This wire is then reshaped into a square.
   - We need to find the length of each side of the square.

2. **Extract Relevant Variables:**
   - Length of the rectangle (L) = 27 cm
   - Breadth of the rectangle (B) = 17 cm

3. **Plan:**
   - First, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, which is the total length of the wire.
   - Since the wire is reshaped into a square, the perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle.
   - Use the perimeter of the square to find the length of each side of the square.

4. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter of rectangle} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Breadth}) = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - The perimeter of the square is also 88 cm.
   - Let the side of the square be \( s \). Then, the perimeter of the square is given by:
     \[
     4s = 88
     \]
   - Solve for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \text{ cm}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of each side of the square is 22 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 22**.

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each daughter receives based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( x \) be the amount each nephew receives.
- According to the problem, each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The total amount of money distributed is Rs 8600. We can express this total in terms of \( x \) as follows:
- Total amount received by 2 nephews: \( 2x \)
- Total amount received by 4 daughters: \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \)
- Total amount received by 5 sons: \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \)

The equation representing the total distribution is:
\[
2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
\]

### Step 3: Simplify and Solve for \( x \)
Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[
43x = 8600
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Amount Each Daughter Receives
Each daughter receives \( 4x \):
\[
4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
\]

### Conclusion
Each daughter receives Rs 800. Therefore, the correct answer is:

98,,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"PLAN: To solve the problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information given.

Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( M \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

This can be translated into the equation:
\[ M = 29 + \frac{1}{2}M \]

To solve for \( M \), we need to isolate \( M \) on one side of the equation. Let's do this step by step:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[ M = 29 + \frac{1}{2}M \]

2. Subtract \(\frac{1}{2}M\) from both sides to get:
   \[ M - \frac{1}{2}M = 29 \]

3. Simplify the left side:
   \[ \frac{1}{2}M = 29 \]

4. To solve for \( M \), multiply both sides by 2:
   \[ M = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The correct choice is:
