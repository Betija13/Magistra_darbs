0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the angle of elevation, the distance from the car to the base of the tower, and the height of the tower. The problem involves trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the height and distance.

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( d_1 \) as the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( d_2 \) as the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know:
1. \(\tan(45°) = 1\), so \( \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \) which implies \( h = d_1 \).
2. \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \).

Since \( h = d_1 \) and \( h = d_2 \sqrt{3} \), we equate these two expressions for \( h \):
\[ d_1 = d_2 \sqrt{3} \]

The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ d_1 - d_2 = d_2 \sqrt{3} - d_2 = d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{d_1 - d_2}{10} = \frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \]

We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the car to travel from \( d_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( d_2 \)):
\[ t = \frac{d_2}{v} = \frac{d_2}{\frac{d_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To simplify \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \]

The denominator simplifies as follows:
\[ (\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = (\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[ \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Therefore, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

The correct answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).",True,,,,,

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the item, which we'll denote as \( P \).

1. **Understanding the Discount**: The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( 78\% \) of the original price. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 0.78P
   \]

2. **Applying the Coupon**: After applying the $20-off coupon, the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   \text{Price Paid} = 0.78P - 20
   \]

3. **Relating to Half the Original Price**: According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation**: We need to solve for \( P \).

   - First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to clear the denominator:
     \[
     2(0.78P - 20) = P + 3.8
     \]
     \[
     1.56P - 40 = P + 3.8
     \]

   - Next, isolate \( P \) by moving all terms involving \( P \) to one side and constant terms to the other:
     \[
     1.56P - P = 3.8 + 40
     \]
     \[
     0.56P = 43.8
     \]

   - Finally, solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 0.56:
     \[
     P = \frac{43.8}{0.56}
     \]
     \[
     P = 78.2142857

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. 

First, let's define the events:
- Let \( P(A) \) be the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is given as 0.56.
- Let \( P(B) \) be the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is given as 0.74.

We are interested in finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both events do not occur. 

The probability that Stock A does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither event occurs, we need to consider the scenario where the events are independent. If the events are independent, the probability that neither event occurs is the product of the probabilities that each event does not occur:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = P(\text{not A}) \times P(\text{not B}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies that we should consider the scenario where the events are not independent and could be mutually exclusive, which would maximize the probability that neither occurs.

If the events are mutually exclusive, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the mutually exclusive scenario is not possible. Therefore, the greatest possible probability that neither event occurs is when the events are independent, which we calculated as 0.1144.

However, this value (0.1144) is not among the given choices. Let's reconsider the problem: the greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the events are as independent as possible, but we must also consider the possibility of overlap in the events.

The greatest probability that neither event occurs, considering overlap, is when the events are completely dependent, meaning one event occurring implies the other does not. In this case, the greatest probability that neither occurs is:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B}) = 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding Profit Percentage**: 
   - A 20% profit means that the selling price is 120% of the cost price. This is because the cost price represents 100%, and the profit adds an additional 20%.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let the cost price be denoted as \( CP \).
   - The selling price (SP) is given as Rs. 360.
   - According to the problem, the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     SP = CP + 0.20 \times CP = 1.20 \times CP
     \]
   - Substituting the given selling price into the equation:
     \[
     360 = 1.20 \times CP
     \]

3. **Solving for the Cost Price**:
   - To find the cost price, we need to solve the equation for \( CP \):
     \[
     CP = \frac{360}{1.20}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     CP = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300
     \]

4. **Verification**:
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, we can verify by calculating the selling price from the cost price:
     - If \( CP = 300 \), then the profit is 20% of 300, which is \( 0.20 \times 300 = 60 \).
     - Therefore, the selling price should be \( 300 + 60 = 360 \), which matches the given selling price.

1. **Understanding the Format**: The bike number format is ""LLNN"", where ""L"" represents a letter and ""N"" represents a number.

2. **Calculating Letter Combinations**:
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
   - Since the problem does not specify that the letters need to be distinct, we assume they can be the same.
   - Therefore, for the first letter, there are 26 possible choices.

1. **Determine the Total Distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination. Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}

4. **Calculate the Remaining Distance:**
   - After covering 250 miles, the remaining distance is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. We are given that there are 200 students in total, and at least 45% attended the prom night, while at least 35% took part in the debating session.

First, let's calculate the minimum number of students who attended each event:

1. **Prom Night Attendance:**
   - At least 45% of 200 students attended the prom night.
   - 45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

2. **Debating Session Participation:**
   - At least 35% of 200 students took part in the debating session.
   - 35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

Now, we need to find the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event. To do this, we should consider the scenario where the overlap between the two groups (students who attended both events) is minimized. This will maximize the number of students who did not attend either event.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion can be applied here:

- Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night, and \( D \) be the set of students who participated in the debating session.
- We want to find the number of students in the complement of the union of these two sets, i.e., \( |P \cup D|^c \).

The formula for the union of two sets is:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]

To maximize the number of students who attended neither event, we need to minimize \( |P \cap D| \). The minimum value for \( |P \cap D| \) is 0, which occurs when there is no overlap between the two groups.

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is:
\[ |P \cup D|^c = 200 - |P \cup D| \]

Substituting the values:
\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 0 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of students who attended neither event is:
\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the overlap:

If we assume the minimum overlap, the calculation should be:
\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - x \]
where \( x \) is the overlap.

To maximize the number of students who attended neither event, we should consider the scenario where the overlap is as small as possible, but still consistent with the constraints. The smallest overlap that satisfies both conditions is when the total number of students attending at least one event is minimized.

Re-evaluating:
- If 90 attended the prom and 70 attended the debate, the minimum overlap is when all 70 debaters are among the 90 prom attendees, i.e., \( x = 70 \).

Thus:
\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

Therefore, the number of students who attended neither event is:
\[ 200 - 90 = 110 \]

3. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The remaining staplers are non-defective. Thus, the number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

4. **Mistakenly Rejected Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.02 \times 0.90x = 72

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     0.018x = 72

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

First, let's calculate the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:

- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

To find the combined rate of both machines working together, we add their individual rates:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Converting each rate to have a denominator of 18:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

So, the combined rate of the two machines is \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

Next, we need to determine how long it will take to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate. We set up the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

Solving for \( t \), we multiply both sides by 18 to clear the fraction:

\[
5t = 180
\]

Then, divide both sides by 5:

\[
t = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

Therefore, it will take 36 minutes for Machines A and B together to produce 10 yo-yos.

The correct answer is (C) 36 minutes.",True,,,,,

E)9!",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many distinct ways we can rearrange the letters of the word ""PROBLEC"" to form 7-letter words, ensuring that no letters are repeated in any arrangement.

First, let's analyze the word ""PROBLEC"":
- The word ""PROBLEC"" consists of 7 distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, and C.

Since all the letters in ""PROBLEC"" are distinct, any permutation of these 7 letters will result in a unique 7-letter word. Therefore, the task is to find the number of permutations of 7 distinct letters.

The formula for finding the number of permutations of n distinct objects is n!, which represents the factorial of n. In this case, n = 7 because there are 7 distinct letters.

Calculating 7! (7 factorial):
- 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040

E)1.5",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability and the independence of events.

The problem asks for \( P(A/B) \), which is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is:

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

However, the problem states that events A and B are independent. For independent events, the probability of both events occurring, \( P(A \cap B) \), is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.8 \)

We can calculate \( P(A \cap B) \) as follows:

\[ P(A \cap B) = 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.16 \]

Now, we substitute this into the conditional probability formula:

\[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.16}{0.8} \]

E)None of the above",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Scenario 1**: You walk 20 steps and then stop. You reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. **Scenario 2**: You walk 10 steps and then stop. You reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

**Scenario 1 Analysis:**

- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

The equation for the elevator's movement in Scenario 1 is:
\[ v \times 10 = S - 20 \]

**Scenario 2 Analysis:**

- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

The equation for the elevator's movement in Scenario 2 is:
\[ v \times 20 = S - 10 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( v \times 10 = S - 20 \)
2. \( v \times 20 = S - 10 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( v \).

From the first equation:
\[ S = 10v + 20 \]

From the second equation:
\[ S = 20v + 10 \]

Set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]

Solve for \( v \):
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]
\[ 20 = 10v + 10 \]
\[ 10 = 10v \]
\[ v = 1 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

\[
\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6
\]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Simplify the Denominator:**

   The denominator of the fraction is \(13 \times 13 - 156\).

   - Calculate \(13 \times 13\):
     \[
     13 \times 13 = 169
     \]

   - Subtract 156 from 169:
     \[
     169 - 156 = 13

   So, the denominator simplifies to 13.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**

   Now, substitute the simplified denominator back into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6

3. **Clear the Fraction:**

   Multiply both sides of the equation by 13 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 \times 13

   Calculate \(6 \times 13\):

   So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 78

   Combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   5 - 15 - 7 = -17

5. **Solve for ?:**

   Add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the question mark:
   \[
   ? \times 19 = 78 + 17

   Calculate \(78 + 17\):
   \[
   78 + 17 = 95

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's understand what a 25% profit on the selling price means. If the selling price of each bag is $100, then the profit per bag is 25% of $100. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

This means the grocer makes a $25 profit for each bag sold.

Next, we need to find out how many bags were sold to achieve a total profit of $3,000. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Total profit} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold. Then:

\[ x \times 25 = 3000 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{3000}{25} \]

\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour to make a $3,000 profit.

However, it seems there is a misunderstanding because the options provided do not include 120. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we interpreted it correctly.

The problem states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which we calculated correctly as $25 per bag. The total profit is $3,000, and we calculated the number of bags as 120, which is consistent with our understanding of the problem.

Since the options provided do not include 120, it is possible that there is an error in the options or the problem statement.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. Alex takes 7 hours to make one toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make one toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).
4. They worked for almost the same number of hours, so \( 7A \approx 9J \).

We can set up the equation based on the approximate equality of their working hours:
\[ 7A = 9J \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. From \( A + J = 35 \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
   \[ A = 35 - J \]

2. Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the equation \( 7A = 9J \):
   \[ 7(35 - J) = 9J \]
   \[ 245 - 7J = 9J \]
   \[ 245 = 16J \]
   \[ J = \frac{245}{16} \]

Calculating \( \frac{245}{16} \) gives us approximately 15.3125. Since \( J \) must be an integer (as you can't make a fraction of a toy), we need to round to the nearest whole number. Given the context of the problem, where they worked for almost the same number of hours, we should choose the integer value that makes the hours worked by Alex and Jacob as close as possible.

Let's check the integer values around 15.3125:

- If \( J = 15 \):
  - \( A = 35 - 15 = 20 \)
  - Hours worked by Alex = \( 7 \times 20 = 140 \)
  - Hours worked by Jacob = \( 9 \times 15 = 135 \)
  - Difference in hours = \( |140 - 135| = 5 \)

- If \( J = 16 \):
  - \( A = 35 - 16 = 19 \)
  - Hours worked by Alex = \( 7 \times 19 = 133 \)
  - Hours worked by Jacob = \( 9 \times 16 = 144 \)
  - Difference in hours = \( |133 - 144| = 11 \)

- If \( J = 17 \):
  - \( A = 35 - 17 = 18 \)
  - Hours worked by Alex = \( 7 \times 18 = 126 \)
  - Hours worked by Jacob = \( 9 \times 17 = 153 \)
  - Difference in hours = \( |126 - 153| = 27 \)

The smallest difference in hours is when \( J = 15 \), which is 5 hours. Therefore, the most reasonable number of toys made by Jacob, given the condition that they worked for almost the same number of hours, is 15.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea solution is 50% strong milk tea. This means that 50% of the solution is tea, and the remaining 50% is milk.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - Initially, the solution is 50% tea. When 15% of the solution is removed, 15% of the tea is also removed.
   - The amount of tea removed is 15% of 50%, which is 0.15 * 50% = 7.5%.
   - After removing 15% of the solution, the remaining tea concentration is 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.
   - The removed portion is replaced with milk, which has 0% tea, so the new concentration of tea remains 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, John replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - The current concentration of tea is 42.5%.
   - Removing 15% of the solution means removing 15% of the tea, which is 0.15 * 42.5% = 6.375%.
   - The remaining tea concentration is 42.5% - 6.375% = 36.125%.
   - The removed portion is replaced with milk, so the new concentration of tea remains 36.125%.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
   - The current concentration of tea is 36.125%.
   - Removing 10% of the solution means removing 10% of the tea, which is 0.10 * 36.125% = 3.6125%.
   - The remaining tea concentration is 36.125% - 3.6125% = 32.5125%.
   - The removed portion is replaced with milk, so the new concentration of tea remains 32.5125%.

1. **Determine Bill's speed on a windy day:**
   - Bill's usual speed is 15 mph.
   - On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph.
   - Therefore, his speed on a windy day is \(15 - 4 = 11\) mph.

2. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - We are given the time as 21 minutes.
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the information given about the cost and the profit margin.

1. **Understand the relationship between cost, selling price, and profit:**
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost.
   - The gross profit is $20.00.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of the appliance.
   - The selling price \( S \) is 40% above the cost, so \( S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).
   - The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, so \( S - C = 20 \).

3. **Set up the equation using the profit information:**
   - From the profit equation, we have \( S - C = 20 \).
   - Substitute the expression for \( S \) from the selling price equation: \( 1.4C - C = 20 \).

4. **Solve for the cost \( C \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 0.4C = 20 \).
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( C \): \( C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50 \).

A)750
B)700
C)620
D)600
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest on the borrowed amount.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money borrowed or invested),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years.

In this problem:
- \( P = 500 \) (the principal amount borrowed),
- \( R = 6\% \) per annum,
- \( T = 4 \) years.

Substituting these values into the simple interest formula gives:

\[ \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. Multiply the principal amount by the rate and the time:
   \[ 500 \times 6 \times 4 = 12000 \]

2. Divide the result by 100 to find the simple interest:
   \[ \frac{12000}{100} = 120 \]

The simple interest accrued over 4 years is Rs. 120.

To find the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{SI} = 500 + 120 = 620 \]

Therefore, the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years is Rs. 620.

D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. We are given two scenarios: the forward journey and the return journey.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (which is the same for both forward and return journeys).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey.

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Speed = \( v \)
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( v \times 6 = 6v \)

3. **Return Journey:**
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Speed = \( v + 12 \) km/hr (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr)
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( (v + 12) \times 4 = 4v + 48 \)

4. **Set the Distances Equal:**
   Since the distance for both journeys is the same, we can set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   6v = 4v + 48

1. **Determine the Original Retail Price:**
   The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, the original retail price \( R \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of folding a rectangular sheet into two equal halves and how it affects the perimeter.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each half will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 48 cm.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Therefore, for the folded part: 
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each half will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, for the folded part:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( l \) and \( w \).

From Equation 1:
\[ l = 48 - 2w \]

Substitute \( l = 48 - 2w \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2w) + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4w + w = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3w = 66 \]
\[ 3w = 96 - 66 \]
\[ 3w = 30 \]
\[ w = 10 \]

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( l \):
\[ l + 2(10) = 48 \]
\[ l + 20 = 48 \]
\[ l = 48 - 20 \]
\[ l = 28 \]

Now, we have the dimensions of the original sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.

The area of the sheet is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \]

However, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The correct approach should be:
- The area of the original sheet is \( l \times w \).
- We found \( l = 28 \) and \( w = 10 \).

Recalculate the area:
\[ \text{Area} = 28 \times 20 = 560 \]

It seems there is a mistake in the options provided or in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the folding and calculations:

The journey from M to Q involves traveling through the following segments:
1. From M to N: 3 bus options
2. From N to O: 4 bus options
3. From O to P: 1 bus option
4. From P to Q: 3 bus options

To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we multiply the number of bus options for each segment of the journey. This is because for each choice of bus on one segment, there are multiple choices for the next segment, and so on, leading to a multiplication of choices.

Let's calculate the total number of ways:

- From M to N, there are 3 choices.
- From N to O, there are 4 choices.
- From O to P, there is 1 choice.
- From P to Q, there are 3 choices.

The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is given by the product of the number of choices for each segment:

Total ways = (Number of ways from M to N) × (Number of ways from N to O) × (Number of ways from O to P) × (Number of ways from P to Q)

E) 20.8888",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the diameter of the sphere in which the rectangular solid is inscribed. The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the rectangular solid and the sphere.

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: 
   - The rectangular solid is a 3D shape with dimensions 3, 4, and 15.
   - When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid. This is because the diagonal is the longest line that can be drawn within the solid, and it will pass through the center of the sphere, touching the sphere at two opposite vertices of the solid.

2. **Calculating the Diagonal of the Rectangular Solid**:
   - The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}

   - For our rectangular solid, the dimensions are \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 15\).

3. **Substitute the Dimensions into the Formula**:
   - Calculate the square of each dimension:
     \[
     3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
     \]
   - Sum these squares:
     \[
     9 + 16 + 225 = 250
     \]
   - Take the square root of the sum to find the diagonal:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{250}

4. **Simplify the Square Root**:
   - The square root of 250 can be simplified as:
     \[
     \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10}

   - Selling Price with 5% discount = \( 0.95M \).

2. **Discount of 7%:**
   - The selling price when a 7% discount is given is \( 93\% \) of the marked price.
   - Selling Price with 7% discount = \( 0.93M \).

According to the problem, when the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount instead of a 5% discount, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means the difference in selling prices between the two discount scenarios is Rs. 15.

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. The salary is composed of a fixed part and a variable part based on sales.

1. **Understand the Salary Structure:**
   - Fixed salary: $500
   - Commission: 5% of monthly sales

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total salary \( S \) is given by the sum of the fixed salary and the commission from sales. Therefore, the equation for the salary is:
   \[
   S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales}
   \]
   We want the total salary \( S \) to be $1500. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales}
   \]

3. **Solve for Sales:**
   - Subtract the fixed salary from both sides to isolate the commission part:
     \[
     1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales}
     \]
     \[
     1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales}
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for Sales:
     \[
     \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sales} = 20000
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If the sales are $20000, the commission would be 5% of $20000, which is $1000.
   - Adding the fixed salary of $500 gives a total salary of $1500, which matches the desired salary.

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average speed of the airplane as it flies around the four sides of a square. The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The airplane flies along the four sides of a square.
   - The speeds for each side are 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.

2. **Assumptions:**
   - Let's assume each side of the square is of length 'd' km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the airplane is 4d km.

3. **Calculating Time for Each Side:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr = \( \frac{d}{200} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr = \( \frac{d}{400} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the third side at 600 km/hr = \( \frac{d}{600} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr = \( \frac{d}{800} \) hours.

4. **Total Time Taken:**
   - Total time = \( \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800} \).

5. **Simplifying the Total Time:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 2400 is a common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800.
   - Convert each fraction:
     - \( \frac{d}{200} = \frac{12d}{2400} \)
     - \( \frac{d}{400} = \frac{6d}{2400} \)
     - \( \frac{d}{600} = \frac{4d}{2400} \)
     - \( \frac{d}{800} = \frac{3d}{2400} \)
   - Total time = \( \frac{12d + 6d + 4d + 3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400} \).

6. **Average Speed Calculation:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Total distance = 4d km
   - Total time = \( \frac{25d}{2400} \) hours
   - Average speed = \( \frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}} = \frac{4d \times 2400}{25d} = \frac{9600d}{25d} = 384 \) km/hr.

40,,"Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( w \) as the number of white sharpeners.
- \( b \) as the number of brown sharpeners.
- \( p_b \) as the price of each brown sharpener.
- \( p_w = p_b + 1 \) as the price of each white sharpener, since each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of sharpeners is 18.
2. The total cost of the sharpeners is 100 rupees.

We can translate these into equations:
1. \( w + b = 18 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( w(p_b + 1) + bp_b = 100 \) (Equation 2)

Let's simplify Equation 2:
- Expand the equation: \( wp_b + w + bp_b = 100 \)
- Combine like terms: \( (w + b)p_b + w = 100 \)

From Equation 1, we know \( w + b = 18 \). Substitute this into the equation:
- \( 18p_b + w = 100 \)

Now, solve for \( w \):
- \( w = 100 - 18p_b \)

Since \( w \) and \( b \) must be non-negative integers, and \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute \( w = 18 - b \) into the equation:
- \( 18 - b = 100 - 18p_b \)
- Rearrange to find \( b \): \( b = 18p_b - 82 \)

Now, we need to find integer values for \( p_b \) such that both \( w \) and \( b \) are non-negative integers. Let's test the options:

**Option A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \)**
- Substitute into Equation 1: \( 10 + 8 = 18 \) (Correct)
- Substitute into Equation 2: \( 10(p_b + 1) + 8p_b = 100 \)
  - \( 10p_b + 10 + 8p_b = 100 \)
  - \( 18p_b + 10 = 100 \)
  - \( 18p_b = 90 \)
  - \( p_b = 5 \)
- Check: \( w = 10, b = 8 \) with \( p_b = 5 \) and \( p_w = 6 \)
  - Total cost: \( 10 \times 6 + 8 \times 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 \) (Correct)

**Option B: \( w = 9, b = 8 \)**
- Substitute into Equation 1: \( 9 + 8 = 17 \) (Incorrect)

**Option C: \( w = 7, b = 8 \)**
- Substitute into Equation 1: \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) (Incorrect)

**Option D: \( w = 5, b = 6 \)**
- Substitute into Equation 1: \( 5 + 6 = 11 \) (Incorrect)

**Option E: \( w = 11, b = 12 \)**
- Substitute into Equation 1: \( 11 + 12 = 23 \) (Incorrect)

The only option that satisfies both equations is Option A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \).

E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then use that information to find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool on its own.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the portion of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining portion of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Placing a 1 after the number \( N \):**
   - This forms the number \( 10N + 1 \).

2. **Placing a 1 before the number \( N \):**
   - This forms the number \( 100000 + N \).

According to the problem, the number with a 1 after it is three times the number with a 1 before it:

\[
10N + 1 = 3(100000 + N)

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[
10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N

Subtract \( 3N \) from both sides:

\[
10N - 3N + 1 = 300000

Simplify:

\[
7N + 1 = 300000

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
7N = 299999

E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must achieve to reach a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees, given his salary and commission structure.

1. **Identify the components of the servant's income:**
   - Fixed monthly salary: 1500 Rupees.
   - Commission: 15% of the monthly sales.

2. **Set up the equation for the total monthly income:**
   The total monthly income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission from sales. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total Income} = \text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission}

   Given that the total income desired is 6000 Rupees, we have:
   \[
   6000 = 1500 + 0.15 \times \text{Sales}

3. **Solve for the sales amount:**
   - First, subtract the fixed salary from the total income to find the income needed from commission:
     \[
     6000 - 1500 = 4500
     \]
   - This means the commission from sales must be 4500 Rupees.
   - Since the commission is 15% of the sales, we set up the equation:
     \[

E)12%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount of Rs.360, given that the man pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 12 \times 31.50 = 378
\]

The man borrowed Rs.360 and paid back Rs.378, so the total interest paid is:

\[
\text{Total interest} = 378 - 360 = 18
\]

Next, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to consider the interest paid over the year. Since the loan is paid back in 12 months, the interest rate we calculate will be the annual interest rate.

The formula for simple interest is:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}
\]

Where:
- Principal = Rs.360
- Rate = the interest rate we need to find
- Time = 1 year (since the installments cover a full year)

We know the simple interest is Rs.18, so we can set up the equation:

\[
18 = \frac{360 \times \text{Rate} \times 1}{100}
\]

Solving for the Rate:

\[
18 = \frac{360 \times \text{Rate}}{100}

Multiply both sides by 100 to clear the fraction:

\[
1800 = 360 \times \text{Rate}

   - The product's price is reduced by 30%. This means the new price is 70% of the original price. If we denote the original price as \( P \), the reduced price is \( 0.7P \).

2. **Finding the Required Increase:**
   - We need to determine the percentage increase required to bring the price back to the original price \( P \) from the reduced price \( 0.7P \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**

   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     0.7P + 0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = P

E)286",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins of each type are in the money pouch. We know that the total amount of money is Rs. 700, and there are equal numbers of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins.

Let's denote the number of each type of coin as \( x \).

1. **Value of 25 paise coins**: Each 25 paise coin is worth 0.25 rupees. Therefore, the total value of the 25 paise coins is \( 0.25x \) rupees.

2. **Value of 50 paise coins**: Each 50 paise coin is worth 0.50 rupees. Therefore, the total value of the 50 paise coins is \( 0.50x \) rupees.

3. **Value of one rupee coins**: Each one rupee coin is worth 1 rupee. Therefore, the total value of the one rupee coins is \( 1x \) rupees.

The total value of all the coins combined is the sum of the values of each type of coin:

\[
0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
1.75x = 700

Calculating the division:

\[
x = 400

Therefore, there are 400 coins of each type.

Now, let's verify the calculation:

- Total value from 25 paise coins: \( 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \) rupees
- Total value from 50 paise coins: \( 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \) rupees
- Total value from one rupee coins: \( 400 \times 1 = 400 \) rupees

Adding these values gives:

D)150
E)180",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges. This is a classic combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges we want to choose).

Plugging these values into the combination formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

Now, let's simplify this expression:

1. Calculate \( 10! \) and \( 8! \):
   - \( 10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8! \)
   - \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \)

2. Substitute back into the formula:
   \[
   C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \times 8!}

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains for Mr. Blue to finish.

1. **Determine the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) of a house.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{9}{12} \).

This is a classic problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which in this case are the intervals at which the trains leave the station: 16 minutes for Train A and 17 minutes for Train B.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Train A departs every 16 minutes.
   - Train B departs every 17 minutes.
   - We need to find the smallest time interval after which both trains will depart together again.

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
   - Since 16 and 17 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product.

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how the painting affects the smaller cubes.

1. **Understanding the Hollow Cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the outer cube is a 5x5x5 cube, and the inner hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube (since 5 - 2*1 = 3).

2. **Total Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The outer cube (5x5x5) consists of 5^3 = 125 smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3x3x3) consists of 3^3 = 27 smaller cubes.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98.

3. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface of the cube is painted, only the cubes on the outermost layer are affected.
   - The outermost layer is a shell of 1 cm thickness around the hollow part.

4. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - If a cube is on the outer surface, at least one of its faces is painted.
   - We need to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.

5. **Counting Unpainted Faces:**
   - For the outermost layer, the cubes on the edges and corners will have more faces painted than those on the flat surfaces.
   - However, the problem asks for the total number of unpainted faces of all smaller cubes.

6. **Calculating Total Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each of the 98 smaller cubes has 6 faces, so there are 98 * 6 = 588 faces in total.

Let's break down the frog's progress:

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog effectively climbs 1 meter (3 meters up during the day minus 2 meters down at night).

2. **Final Day**: On the final day, the frog will jump out of the well without slipping back. This means that on the last day, the frog will not fall back 2 meters because it will have already exited the well.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The frog needs to reach a height of 30 meters to get out of the well.
   - If the frog climbs 1 meter per day, it will take 27 days to reach 27 meters (since 27 meters is the last point where the frog will still slip back).

Let's denote the five consecutive odd numbers as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \). These are consecutive because each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

We are given that this sum, when divided by 10, should be a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( k^2 \) be this perfect square:
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \]
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

   46 is not odd.

4. **\( k = 6 \):**
   \[ n = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 36 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \]
   68 is not odd.

5. **\( k = 7 \):**

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a batting average in cricket. The batting average is calculated as the total number of runs scored divided by the number of matches played.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51. This means:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51
\]

From this equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54. This means the total number of matches played becomes \( x + 1 \) and the total runs become \( y + 78 \). The new average is given by:

\[
\frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
\]

Expand the right side:

\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \):

\[
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x
\]

Simplify:

\[
24 = 3x
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{24}{3} = 8

Thus, the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals is 8. Including the finals, the total number of matches played is \( x + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, where each code can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, meaning that a pair like ""AB"" is the same as ""BA"".

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use a single letter as a code, each letter represents one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use a pair of two different letters, the number of unique pairs we can create from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the total number of unique codes (single letters + pairs of letters) is at least 10.

Let's calculate for different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3 (A, B, C)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) (AB, AC, BC)
  - Total codes = 3 + 3 = 6
  - This is not enough, as we need at least 10 codes.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 4 (A, B, C, D)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD)
  - Total codes = 4 + 6 = 10
  - This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **\( n = 5 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 5 (A, B, C, D, E)
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \) (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE)
  - Total codes = 5 + 10 = 15
  - This is more than enough, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) is the smallest number of letters that allows us to create at least 10 unique codes, the correct answer is:

B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land given its area and a relationship between its length and breadth.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 150 square meters.
   - The length (L) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth (B). This can be expressed as:
     \[
     L = 4B + 1
     \]

2. **Use the formula for the area of a rectangle:**
   - The area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = L \times B
     \]
   - Substituting the given area and the expression for L, we have:
     \[
     150 = (4B + 1) \times B
     \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Expanding the equation:
     \[
     150 = 4B^2 + B
     \]
   - Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:
     \[
     4B^2 + B - 150 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \(a = 4\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -150\).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we proceed:
     \[
     B = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8}
     \]
   - \(\sqrt{2401} = 49\), so:
     \[
     B = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for B:
     \[
     B = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad B = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25
     \]
   - Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense, we take \(B = 6\).

5. **Find the length using the relationship:**
   - Substitute \(B = 6\) into the expression for L:
     \[
     L = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25
     \]

6. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(L + B)

E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement for vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement for vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%

   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5

3. **Determine the Minimum Grams Required:**
   - To satisfy both vitamin requirements, we need to consume enough grams to meet the higher of the two calculated requirements.
   - From the calculations, we need at least 11.11 grams for vitamin E and 12.5 grams for vitamin A.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of grams required to meet both requirements is 12.5 grams.

A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes within the available time of 3 hours.

First, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Large Cakes Requirement:**
   - We need 20 large cakes.
   - Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, one helper can make \(2 \text{ cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ large cakes}\).

   To find out how many helpers are needed for 20 large cakes:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{6 \text{ large cakes/helper}} \approx 3.33 \text{ helpers}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers needed for the large cakes.

2. **Small Cakes Requirement:**
   - We need 700 small cakes.
   - Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, one helper can make \(35 \text{ cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ small cakes}\).

   To find out how many helpers are needed for 700 small cakes:
   \[
   \frac{700 \text{ small cakes}}{105 \text{ small cakes/helper}} \approx 6.67 \text{ helpers}
   \]
   Again, rounding up, we need 7 helpers for the small cakes.

3. **Total Helpers Required:**
   - We need 4 helpers for the large cakes and 7 helpers for the small cakes.
   - Since these tasks can be done simultaneously, we add the number of helpers needed for each task: \(4 + 7 = 11\).

However, 11 is not one of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the calculations to ensure accuracy:

- For large cakes: \( \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33 \), round up to 4.
- For small cakes: \( \frac{700}{105} \approx 6.67 \), round up to 7.

Adding these gives 11, which is not an option. Let's consider the possibility of a mistake in rounding or calculation:

- Re-evaluate the total number of helpers needed by considering the overlap or any possible miscalculation in the problem setup.

Upon re-evaluation, the correct approach should be to ensure that the total number of helpers is sufficient for both tasks, considering the constraints and rounding up correctly. The closest option that could potentially cover any miscalculation or overlap in tasks is option (C) 12.

B)7
C)8
D)9
E)10",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the line segment RU given the information about the points R, S, T, and U on a line.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Use the midpoint information:**
   Since U is the midpoint of ST, the line segment ST is divided into two equal parts by U. Therefore, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

3. **Determine the positions of the points:**
   - Let's assume point S is at position 0 on a number line.
   - Since RS = 5, point R is at position -5.
   - Since ST = 22, point T is at position 22.
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, U is at position (0 + 22)/2 = 11.

4. **Calculate RU:**
   - RU is the distance between points R and U.
   - R is at position -5 and U is at position 11.
   - Therefore, RU = |11 - (-5)| = |11 + 5| = 16.

5. **Check the options:**

Upon reviewing the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or miscalculation. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

- If RS = 5 and RT = 17, then T should be at position 12 (since R is at -5 and RT = 17, T = -5 + 17 = 12).
- However, we initially placed T at 22 based on ST = 22, which is consistent with S at 0 and T at 22.

Given the correct setup, the calculation of RU should be based on the correct positions of R and U:

- R is at -5, and U is at 11 (midpoint of S at 0 and T at 22).
- Therefore, RU = |11 - (-5)| = |11 + 5| = 16.

The discrepancy suggests a potential error in the problem setup or options provided. However, based on the logical setup and calculations, the length of RU should be 16, which is not an option. This indicates a possible error in the problem statement or options.

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain. Let's define variables for the amount of falafel in each type of bread:

- Let \( P \) be the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- Let \( R \) be the amount of falafel in one roll.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of falafel in one baguette.

We are given the following relationships:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   3P = R
   \]
   So, one roll contains the same amount of falafel as three pita breads.

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B
   \]
   Using the relationship \( R = 3P \) from the first equation, substitute \( R \) in the second equation:
   \[
   3(3P) = 5B
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   9P = 5B

   Solving for \( B \), we find:
   \[
   B = \frac{9}{5}P

Now, we need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Using the relationship \( B = \frac{9}{5}P \), we calculate the amount of falafel in two baguettes:
\[
2B = 2 \times \frac{9}{5}P = \frac{18}{5}P
\]

We want to express this amount in terms of pita breads. Since one pita bread contains \( P \) amount of falafel, the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes is:
\[
\frac{\frac{18}{5}P}{P} = \frac{18}{5}

C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding the Discount**: 
   - The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items. This means that the selling price on the discount day is 80% of the original price. 
   - If the original price of an item is \( P \), the discounted price is \( 0.8P \).

2. **Finding the Required Increase**:
   - The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price \( P \).
   - To find the percentage increase needed to go from the discounted price \( 0.8P \) back to the original price \( P \), we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the discounted price, and then express this difference as a percentage of the discounted price.

3. **Calculating the Increase**:
   - The difference between the original price and the discounted price is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).
   - To find the percentage increase, we divide this difference by the discounted price and multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v_s \) be the speed of the ship.
   - The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts.
   - The plane travels at a speed of \( 10 \times v_s \).

2. **Time Consideration:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time (in hours) after the plane starts when they meet.
   - In this time \( t \), the ship will have traveled an additional distance of \( v_s \times t \).
   - The plane, starting from the same point as the ship, will travel a distance of \( 10 \times v_s \times t \).

3. **Distance Equation:**
   - At the meeting point, the total distance traveled by the ship is \( 180 + v_s \times t \).

E)7500",E,"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of proportions to estimate the total deer population in the forest. The key idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample should be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the Proportion in the Sample:**
   - In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them had tags. 
   - The proportion of tagged deer in this sample is \( \frac{20}{500} = 0.04 \).

2. **Set Up the Proportion for the Entire Population:**
   - We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. 
   - Let \( N \) be the total deer population in the forest.
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population should be the same as the proportion in the sample, which is 0.04.

3. **Formulate the Equation:**
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is \( \frac{300}{N} \).
   - Set this equal to the sample proportion: 
     \[
     \frac{300}{N} = 0.04
     \]

4. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - Multiply both sides by \( N \) to get rid of the fraction:
     \[
     300 = 0.04N
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.04 to solve for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{0.04} = 7500
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total deer population in the forest is 7500.

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
A)0.9
B)0.8
C)0.6
D)0.65
E)1.5",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. We have two train lines: the main line and the harbor line. The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M., and the harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M.

Let's break down the schedule:

- Main line train schedule: 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, ...
- Harbor line train schedule: 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, ...

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:10 A.M. We need to determine the probability that the first train he catches is the main line train.

1. **Time Interval Analysis:**
   - From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first train available.
   - From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first train available.

2. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - The total time interval we are considering is 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10).
   - The main line train is the first train for 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02).
   - The harbor line train is the first train for 8 minutes (from 5:02 to 5:10).

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Probability of catching the main line train first = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval)
   - Probability = 2 minutes / 10 minutes = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that the man catches the first train, which is the main line train, is 0.2.

However, the problem asks for the probability of catching the first train, regardless of which line it is. Since the man will catch either the main line train or the harbor line train, the probability of catching the first train is actually 1, because he will always catch one of the two trains.

Thus, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided. However, if we consider the probability of catching the first train that arrives (either main or harbor), it should be 1. But since the options do not include 1, and considering the context of the problem, the closest interpretation is that the man will always catch a train, so the probability is effectively 1.

Given the options, none of them correctly represent the probability of catching the first train as 1. However, if we were to choose based on the closest understanding of the problem, the probability of catching the first train (either main or harbor) is 1, but this is not an option.

1. The average weight of the original 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons.
2. After adding the new truck, the average weight of the 11 vehicles increased by 2.6 tons.

Let's break down the steps to find the weight of the new truck:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:**
   - The average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons.
   - Therefore, the total weight of these 10 vehicles is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of 10 vehicles} = 10 \times 12.2 = 122 \text{ tons}

2. **Determine the new average weight after adding the truck:**
   - The average weight increased by 2.6 tons, so the new average weight of the 11 vehicles is:
     \[
     12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 \text{ tons}

3. **Calculate the total weight of the 11 vehicles:**
   - With the new average weight of 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles, the total weight of the 11 vehicles is:

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the population changes over the years.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population one year from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \]

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times (1.10)^2 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Let's denote the population last year as \( P_{\text{last year}} \).

From the equation, we have:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Solving for \( P_{\text{last year}} \), we get:

\[ P_{\text{last year}} = \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( P_{\text{last year}} \) to \( P \).

The increase in population from last year to this year is:

\[ P - P_{\text{last year}} = P - \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ P - \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} = P \left(1 - \frac{1.21}{2}\right) = P \left(\frac{2 - 1.21}{2}\right) = P \left(\frac{0.79}{2}\right) = P \times 0.395 \]

The percent increase is:

\[ \frac{P \times 0.395}{P_{\text{last year}}} \times 100\% \]

Since \( P_{\text{last year}} = \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \), we have:

\[ \frac{P \times 0.395}{\frac{P \times 1.21}{2}} \times 100\% = \frac{0.395 \times 2}{1.21} \times 100\% \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \frac{0.79}{1.21} \times 100\% \approx 65.29\% \]

Therefore, the closest percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is approximately 65%.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the amount of money Arjun has.
- \( S \) as the amount of money Sajal has.

We have two scenarios described in the problem:

1. **First Scenario:**
   - If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     S + 30 = 2A - 60
     \]
     \[
     S = 2A - 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     A + 10 = 3S - 30
     \]
     \[
     A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

We can solve this system by substitution. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 310
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( A \):

\[
310 = 6A - A
\]
\[
310 = 5A
\]
\[
A = 62
\]

Now that we have \( A = 62 \), substitute back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):

\[
S = 2(62) - 90
\]
\[
S = 124 - 90

\[
S = 34

2. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

In this problem, we can consider the given width as 100 feet and the area as 3,000 square feet. We need to find the length, which we will denote as \( L \).

Substituting the known values into the area formula, we have:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) (the untrimmed side) and \( s - 4 \) (the trimmed side).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles, each with legs \( s \) and \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculating the Area of the Triangles:**
   - The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For one triangle, the area is \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation: \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: \(s \times (s - 4) = 140\).
   - Expand the equation: \(s^2 - 4s = 140\).
   - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation: \(s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\).

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula: \(s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -140\).
   - Calculate the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576\).
   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Solve for \(s\): \(s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}\).

6. **Finding the Positive Solution:**
   - The solutions are \(s = \frac{28}{2} = 14\) and \(s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10\).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \(s = 14\).

7. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The side length of the original square is 14 feet.

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means for the length of the ribbon to be reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the original length of the ribbon is divided into two parts in the ratio 5:3, and the new length is the smaller part of this division.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, the new length is 3 parts. This implies that the original length is divided into a total of 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

2. **Calculating the Length of Each Part**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. Since this length is divided into 8 equal parts, each part is:
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Finding the New Length**: According to the ratio, the new length corresponds to 3 parts. Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is:
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, upon reviewing the options provided, 11.25 cm is not listed. This suggests a potential oversight in the interpretation of the problem or the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- The problem states the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3, which typically means the new length is 3 parts out of the total 8 parts (5 + 3). 

- The calculation of 3 parts as 11.25 cm is correct, but since this does not match any of the given options, let's consider if the problem might be interpreted differently or if there is a rounding or simplification in the options.

E)None",A,"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations involving the three-digit numbers \( M \) and \( N \).

1. **Understanding the Numbers:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number where \( a, b, c \) are digits.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Expressing \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)

7. **Finding Valid Values for \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits, \( a \) must be between 1 and 9, and \( c \) must be between 0 and 9.
   - From \( a = 10 - 3c \), we find:
     - \( a \geq 1 \) implies \( 10 - 3c \geq 1 \) or \( 9 \geq 3c \) or \( c \leq 3 \).
     - \( a \leq 9 \) implies \( 10 - 3c \leq 9 \) or \( 1 \leq 3c \) or \( c \geq \frac{1}{3} \).

8. **Possible Values for \( c \):**
   - Since \( c \) is a digit, \( c \) can be 1, 2, or 3.

9. **Calculating \( M \) for Each \( c \):**
   - For \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \). So, \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 700 + 10b + 1 \).
   - For \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \). So, \( M = 400 + 10b + 2 \).
   - For \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \). So, \( M = 100 + 10b + 3 \).

10. **Counting Values of \( M \) Greater than 300:**
    - For \( c = 1 \), \( M = 701, 711, 721, \ldots, 791 \) (9 values).
    - For \( c = 2 \), \( M = 402, 412, 422, \ldots, 492 \) (9 values).

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age and their age relationship 5 years ago.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.

2. **Calculate Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Since Raj is currently 17 years old, 5 years ago he was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.

3. **Set up the relationship from 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. This means that Raj's age 5 years ago (12 years) was one-third of Rahim's age at that time.
   - Let \( R \) be Rahim's age 5 years ago. According to the problem, \( 12 = \frac{1}{3}R \).

4. **Solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( R \):
     \[
     12 \times 3 = R

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area at a rate of 10 square feet per day.

1. **Determine the Grazing Area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - Substituting the radius (14 feet) into the formula gives:
     \[
     A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
     \]
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 3.14 \times 196 = 615.44 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.
   - To find the number of days required to graze the entire area, divide the total area by the grazing rate:
     \[
     \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} = 61.544
     \]
   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Determine the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means that the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP).

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP
   \]

   Given that SP = Rs. 27.50, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50
   \]

   Solving for CP:

   \[
   CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this selling price to the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   - Selling Price (new) = Rs. 25.75
   - Cost Price = Rs. 25.00

   The difference between the selling price and the cost price is:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
   \]

   Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100 = 3\%

D)1
E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children, Susan, Tim, and Zen, on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is given by the factorial of 3, which is:

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

These 6 arrangements are:
1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Susan, Zen, Tim
3. Tim, Susan, Zen
4. Tim, Zen, Susan
5. Zen, Susan, Tim
6. Zen, Tim, Susan

Next, we apply the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. We can do this by examining each of the 6 arrangements and checking if Susan is indeed to the left of Tim:

1. Susan, Tim, Zen (Susan is to the left of Tim)
2. Susan, Zen, Tim (Susan is to the left of Tim)
3. Tim, Susan, Zen (Susan is not to the left of Tim)
4. Tim, Zen, Susan (Susan is not to the left of Tim)
5. Zen, Susan, Tim (Susan is to the left of Tim)
6. Zen, Tim, Susan (Susan is not to the left of Tim)

From this list, we see that there are 3 arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim:
- Susan, Tim, Zen

91,,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. The bill is composed of a fixed part and a variable part that depends on the number of calls made.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.
- \( C \) as the number of calls made.

The total bill \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = F + V \times C \]

We have two scenarios given in the problem:

1. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[ 1800 = F + 540V \]

2. When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[ 2040 = F + 620V \]

We have two equations with two unknowns (F and V):
1. \( 1800 = F + 540V \)
2. \( 2040 = F + 620V \)

To find \( F \) and \( V \), we can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (2040 - 1800) = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) \]
\[ 240 = 80V \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Using the first equation:

\[ 1800 = F + 540 \times 3 \]
\[ 1800 = F + 1620 \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 \]

Now we have both the fixed and variable components:
- Fixed part \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

Finally, we need to calculate the bill for a month when 500 calls are made:

\[ B = F + V \times C \]
\[ B = 180 + 3 \times 500 \]
\[ B = 180 + 1500 \]
\[ B = 1680 \]

Therefore, the bill for the month when 500 calls are made is Rs.1680.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

1. **Ball A:**
   - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball A is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.

2. **Ball B:**
   - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball B is \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

- Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: \( 13 \times 7 = 91 \).

Thus, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Finally, we convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes = 1 hour, and 91 - 60 = 31 minutes).

A)10
B)15

- Total number of books on the bookshelf: 45
- Number of hardcover books: 30
- Number of fiction books: 20

We are looking for the maximum overlap between the hardcover books and the fiction books, i.e., the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

To find this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:

\[ \text{Number of books that are both hardcover and fiction} = \text{Number of hardcover books} + \text{Number of fiction books} - \text{Total number of books} \]

However, this formula gives us the minimum number of books that are either hardcover or fiction, not the maximum overlap. Instead, we need to consider the constraints:

1. The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two groups (hardcover or fiction). This is because you cannot have more books in the intersection than you have in either group.

2. The number of fiction books is 20, and the number of hardcover books is 30. Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller group, which is the fiction books.

Thus, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20, as you cannot have more than 20 fiction books that are also hardcover.

1. **Cost of Newspapers:**
   - Sunday: $4 per newspaper
   - Monday to Saturday: $1 per newspaper

2. **Weekly Expenditure:**
   - Total cost per week: $210

3. **Order Pattern:**
   - The hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on any other day of the week.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of newspapers bought on Monday (and each of the other weekdays, Monday through Saturday).
- \( 2x \) as the number of newspapers bought on Sunday (since the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total weekly cost:

- **Cost for Sunday:** \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \)
- **Cost for Monday to Saturday:** \( 6 \times x \times 1 = 6x \)

The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for Sunday and the rest of the week:

\[ 8x + 6x = 210 \]

B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of friends who actually attended the picnic. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic.
   - The total cost of the picnic is Rs. 96.

2. **Initial Contribution:**
   - If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.

3. **Change in Plan:**
   - Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).
   - The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of the \( x - 4 \) friends contributed \( \frac{96}{x} + 4 \) rupees.

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - The total contribution by the remaining friends is still Rs. 96. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     (x - 4) \left(\frac{96}{x} + 4\right) = 96

Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, we need to calculate the total amount distributed among all the children:
- There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:
\[ 2x + 16x + 25x = 43x \]

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so we set up the equation:
\[ 43x = 8600 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 43:
\[ x = \frac{8600}{43} \]

Calculating this gives:

According to the problem, Meenu's weight can be expressed by the equation:
\[ W = 29 + \frac{1}{2}W \]

To solve for \( W \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the fraction by multiplying every term by 2 to get rid of the denominator:
\[ 2W = 58 + W \]

Next, we subtract \( W \) from both sides to solve for \( W \):
\[ 2W - W = 58 \]
\[ W = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. 

Now, let's verify our solution by substituting \( W = 58 \) back into the original condition:

S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
\]
where \( a \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference.

In this problem:
- \( a = 7 \)
- \( d = \frac{1}{4} \)
- \( S_n = 250 \)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4}\right)
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(\frac{56 + n - 1}{4}\right)
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{55 + n}{4}
\]
\[
250 = \frac{n(55 + n)}{8}
\]
\[
2000 = n(55 + n)
\]
\[
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0 \). We can solve this using the quadratic formula:
\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025
\]

The square root of 11025 is 105. So, the solutions for \( n \) are:
\[
n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( n \):
1. \( n = \frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
2. \( n = \frac{-55 - 105}{2} = \frac{-160}{2} = -80 \) (not possible since \( n \) must be positive)

Thus, the number of members in the club is 25.

A)D/(M-3)
B)MD/3
C)M/(D-3)
D)3D/(M2-3M)
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more each remaining man will have to contribute if 3 men drop out from the original group of M men.

Initially, the total cost of the gift is Rs. D, and it is to be shared equally among M men. Therefore, the initial contribution per man is:

\[ \text{Initial contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M} \]

If 3 men drop out, the number of men left to share the cost is \( M - 3 \). The new contribution per man will be:

\[ \text{New contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} \]

The additional amount each remaining man has to contribute is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution:

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} - \frac{D}{M} \]

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M - 3) \):

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D \cdot M - D \cdot (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[ D \cdot M - D \cdot (M - 3) = DM - (DM - 3D) = 3D \]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{3D}{M(M - 3)} \]

A)1,879
B)1,875

D)1,872
E)1,800",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the sewing machine such that after offering a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit on the cost price.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Cost Price and Desired Profit:**
   - The cost price (CP) of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - Karan wants to make a 20% profit on this cost price.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - A 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200 means the selling price (SP) should be:
     \[
     SP = CP + (20\% \text{ of } CP) = 1200 + 0.2 \times 1200 = 1200 + 240 = 1440
     \]
   - Therefore, Karan needs to sell the sewing machine for Rs. 1440 to achieve a 20% profit.

3. **Determine the Marked Price with a 20% Discount:**
   - Let the marked price be \( M \).
   - Karan offers a 20% discount on the marked price.
   - The selling price after the discount is 80% of the marked price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).
   - Therefore, the equation relating the marked price and the selling price is:
     \[
     0.8 \times M = 1440
     \]

4. **Solve for the Marked Price:**
   - To find \( M \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:
     \[
     M = \frac{1440}{0.8} = 1800
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If the marked price is Rs. 1800, a 20% discount on this would be:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.2 \times 1800 = 360
     \]
   - The selling price after the discount would be:
     \[
     1800 - 360 = 1440
     \]
   - This matches the required selling price for a 20% profit, confirming our calculation is correct.

Therefore, the correct marked price is Rs. 1800, which corresponds to option (E).

C)5 pm on the next day
D)2 pm on the next day
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when Train A and Train B will meet each other. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm. Therefore, Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In these 3 hours, Train A travels a distance of \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Relative speed of the trains:**
   - Train A travels at 40 kmph and Train B travels at 72 kmph.
   - Since both trains are moving in the same direction, the relative speed at which Train B is catching up to Train A is \(72 \text{ kmph} - 40 \text{ kmph} = 32 \text{ kmph}\).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up:**
   - Train B needs to cover the 120 km head start that Train A has.
   - Time taken to catch up = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{32 \text{ kmph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3.75 hours to 2 pm gives us the meeting time.
   - 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.
   - Adding 3 hours to 2 pm gives us 5 pm.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the amount of money Mark has.
- \( J \) as the amount of money John has.

According to the problem, Mark tells John, ""If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \]

John then says, ""If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75."" This can be translated into the equation:
\[ J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \]

Substitute this expression for \( M \) into the second equation:
\[ J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75 \]
\[ J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ J - \frac{J}{6} = 50 \]

Combine the terms involving \( J \):
\[ \frac{6J}{6} - \frac{J}{6} = 50 \]
\[ \frac{5J}{6} = 50 \]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[ 5J = 300 \]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( J \):

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial Condition**: Starting with 1 water lily, the lake is fully covered in 60 days.

2. **Doubling Pattern**: Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can express the number of lilies on the lake as a function of time. If \( n \) is the number of two-day periods, then the number of lilies is \( 2^n \).

3. **Full Coverage**: After 60 days, the lake is fully covered. Since the lilies double every two days, there are \( 60/2 = 30 \) two-day periods. Therefore, the number of lilies on the 60th day is \( 2^{30} \).

4. **New Initial Condition**: Now, we need to determine how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered if we start with 64 lilies instead of 1.

5. **Express 64 as a Power of 2**: We know that 64 is \( 2^6 \). This means that starting with 64 lilies is equivalent to starting with \( 2^6 \) lilies.

6. **Calculate Remaining Doublings**: Since the lake is fully covered with \( 2^{30} \) lilies, starting with \( 2^6 \) lilies means we need to reach \( 2^{30} \) from \( 2^6 \). The number of additional doublings required is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

7. **Convert Doublings to Days**: Each doubling takes 2 days. Therefore, 24 doublings will take \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) days.

8. **Total Days**: Since we started with 64 lilies, the total number of days required for the lake to be fully covered is 48 days from the initial condition of 64 lilies.

E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work they can complete.

The problem states that ""x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days."" This implies that the total work done is a function of the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, and the number of days they work. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Scenario:**
   - Number of men = x
   - Hours per day = x
   - Number of days = x
   - Total work done = x units

   The total work done can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total work} = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days})
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   x \times x \times x = x^3
   \]
   Since this equals x units of work, we have:
   \[
   x^3 = x
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   x^3 = x \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1 \text{ (since x is positive)}
   \]

2. **New Scenario:**
   - Number of men = y
   - Hours per day = y
   - Number of days = y

   We need to find the total work done in this scenario:
   \[
   \text{Total work} = y \times y \times y = y^3
   \]

3. **Comparing the Two Scenarios:**
   - In the initial scenario, x men working x hours per day for x days complete x units of work, which simplifies to x = 1 unit of work.
   - In the new scenario, y men working y hours per day for y days complete y^3 units of work.

4. **Finding the Ratio:**
   - We need to express the work done by y men in terms of the work done by x men.
   - Since x = 1, the work done by y men is simply y^3 units.

5. **Answer:**
   - The work done by y men in y days working y hours per day is y^3 units.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to choose 4 points from these 6 points. This can be calculated using the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of points, and \( k \) is the number of points to choose. In this case, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \).

\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 ways to choose 4 points from the 6 points.

Next, we need to ensure that each selection of 4 points indeed forms a quadrilateral. Since F is the center of the pentagon, any selection of 4 points that includes F will form a quadrilateral. Additionally, any selection of 4 points from A, B, C, D, and E (the vertices of the pentagon) will also form a quadrilateral, as no three of these points are collinear.

Thus, all 15 combinations of 4 points will form a quadrilateral. Therefore, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is 15.

   - Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
   - Point B bisects minor arc AC.

2. **Analyzing the Bisection:**
   - Since B bisects minor arc AC, it means that arc AB = arc BC.
   - Therefore, arc AB = arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.

3. **Determining Arc AD:**
   - We need to find the measure of minor arc AD.
   - Arc AD can be expressed as the sum of arcs AB and BD.
   - We already know arc AB = 80°.

5. **Checking the Options:**
   - The calculated measure of arc AD is 230°, but this is not one of the given options.
   - Let's reconsider the problem: since the circle is 360°, and we are dealing with minor arcs, we should ensure that the arcs do not exceed 180°.

We are asked to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

First, let's determine the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither vacation, the remaining 80% must take at least one type of vacation (either winter, summer, or both).

Next, we know that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. This includes those who take both a winter and a summer vacation. Since 40% take both vacations, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is:

Now, let's find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one vacation and 20% take neither, we know that:

\[ \text{Summer Vacation} = 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

This 45% includes those who take both vacations (40%) and those who take only a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is:

First, let's simplify the expression in the numerator:

1. The term \( n^2 \) is straightforward.
2. The term \( 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be expanded to \( 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} \).
3. The constant term is \( 16 \).

2. **Calculate the maximum value of \( x \):**

   - For \( n = 72 \):
     \[
     x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4

117,,"A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
A)8.75
B)8.79
C)8.75
D)8.71
E)8.72",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the square paper and then subtract the area of the two semi-circles that are cut out.

1. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   - The paper is in the form of a square with each side measuring 20 cm.
   - The area of a square is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area of square} = \text{side}^2 = 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the semi-circles:**
   - Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square, using the sides of the square as diameters.
   - The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, which means the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
     \[
     r = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - The area of a full circle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area of circle} = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is half of the area of a full circle:
     \[
     \text{Area of one semi-circle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (10)^2 = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is:
     \[
     \text{Total area of semi-circles} = 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the total area of the semi-circles from the area of the square:
     \[
     \text{Area of remaining paper} = 400 - 100\pi
     \]
   - Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we calculate:
     \[
     100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314

B)94 men
C)95 men
D)96 men
E)97 men",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of days, and the amount of work completed. The problem states that 8 men can complete the work in 6 days. We need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day.

First, let's calculate the total amount of work in terms of ""man-days."" A ""man-day"" is the amount of work one man can complete in one day. If 8 men complete the work in 6 days, the total work is:

\[ \text{Total work} = 8 \, \text{men} \times 6 \, \text{days} = 48 \, \text{man-days} \]

This means the entire work requires 48 man-days to complete.

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day. Let's denote the number of men required as \( x \).

The equation for the total work in terms of the new scenario is:

\[ x \, \text{men} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{day} = 48 \, \text{man-days} \]

Solving for \( x \), we have:

\[ x \times \frac{1}{2} = 48 \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 48 \times 2 \]

\[ x = 96 \]

Initially, the group has 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined the group as \( x \). Therefore, after the membership drive, the number of boys becomes \( 64 + x \) and the number of girls becomes \( 40 + x \).

According to the problem, the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We can set up the equation based on this ratio:

\[
\frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:

\[
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[
192 = 160 + x

B)240
C)30
D)60
E)120",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour. The key here is to use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given:
- Distance = 48 miles
- Speed = 12 miles per hour

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{48 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, the problem asks for the time in minutes, not hours. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, to convert the time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} \]

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

E)25",A,"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the original number based on the information given in the problem. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**
   - We are told that when 30 is subtracted from a number, the result is one third of the original number.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let the original number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, subtracting 30 from this number gives us one third of the number:
     \[
     x - 30 = \frac{x}{3}

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109:
   \[

3. Subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse of the number:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

Let's simplify the third condition:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

\[
100a + c - 495 = 100c + a

Now we have three equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)
3. \( a - c = 5 \)

From equation 3, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(c + 5) + b + c = 17

\[
b = 12 - 2c

Now substitute \( a = c + 5 \) and \( b = 12 - 2c \) into equation 2:

Expanding each term:
\[
(c^2 + 10c + 25) + (144 - 48c + 4c^2) + c^2 = 109

where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1

Since the discriminant is a perfect square, the roots are real and rational:
\[
c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}

This gives us two possible values for \( c \):
\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(not an integer, discard)}

\[
c = \frac{18}{6} = 3

Thus, \( c = 3 \). Substitute back to find \( a \) and \( b \):

C)59:90
D)59:91
E)69:101",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, and then combine them to find the ratio in alloy Z.

1. **Determine the composition of alloy X:**
   - Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9.
   - This ratio can be simplified to 2:3.
   - In 40 grams of alloy X, the fraction of zinc is 2/(2+3) = 2/5, and the fraction of copper is 3/(2+3) = 3/5.
   - Therefore, the amount of zinc in alloy X is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams.
   - The amount of copper in alloy X is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.

2. **Determine the composition of alloy Y:**
   - Alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.
   - In 60 grams of alloy Y, the fraction of zinc is 7/(7+11) = 7/18, and the fraction of copper is 11/(7+11) = 11/18.
   - Therefore, the amount of zinc in alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (approximately).
   - The amount of copper in alloy Y is (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (approximately).

3. **Combine the amounts to form alloy Z:**
   - Total zinc in alloy Z = zinc from X + zinc from Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams.
   - Total copper in alloy Z = copper from X + copper from Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.

4. **Calculate the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**
   - The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67.
   - To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both numbers by 3 to avoid decimals:
     - 39.33 * 3 = 118
     - 60.67 * 3 = 182
   - The simplified ratio is 118:182, which can be further simplified by dividing both numbers by 2:
     - 118 / 2 = 59
     - 182 / 2 = 91
   - Therefore, the simplified ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.

127,,"The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's?
A)18
B)20
C)22
D)24
E)26",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many senators can be attributed to Hoopsmot based on his contribution to the total bribery pool.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money in the bribery pool. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 and Smolapon contributes $4,000. Therefore, the total pool is:

\[ 16,000 + 4,000 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to find out what fraction of the total pool Hoopsmot's contribution represents. This is calculated by dividing Hoopsmot's contribution by the total pool:

\[ \frac{16,000}{20,000} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5} \]

This means Hoopsmot's contribution accounts for \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the total bribery pool.

Since the total pool allows them to influence 30 senators, we need to determine how many of these senators can be attributed to Hoopsmot. We do this by multiplying the total number of senators by the fraction of the pool that Hoopsmot contributed:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 30 = 24 \]

Therefore, 24 senators can be considered Hoopsmot's based on his contribution.

D)None of these
E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers, let's call them \( x \) and \( y \), such that:

1. The difference of their squares is 256000: \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000: \( x + y = 1000 \)

The equation \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \) can be factored using the difference of squares formula:

\[ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \]

Substituting the given sum of the numbers into this equation, we have:

\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]

Since \( x + y = 1000 \), we substitute this into the equation:

\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

Now, solve for \( x - y \):

\[ x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]
\[ 2x = 1256 \]
\[ x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 628 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 1000 \):

\[ 628 + y = 1000 \]
\[ y = 1000 - 628 = 372 \]

Thus, the two numbers are 628 and 372.

Now, let's verify the solution by checking the difference of their squares:

\[ x^2 - y^2 = 628^2 - 372^2 \]

Calculate \( 628^2 \) and \( 372^2 \):

\[ 628^2 = 394384 \]
\[ 372^2 = 138384 \]

Now, find the difference:

\[ 394384 - 138384 = 256000 \]

The calculations confirm that the difference of the squares is indeed 256000, which matches the problem statement.

The formula to find the percentage of one number relative to another is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

In this context:
- The ""Part"" is the astronaut's weight on Venus, which is 182 pounds.
- The ""Whole"" is the astronaut's weight on Earth, which is 211 pounds.

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{182}{211} \approx 0.86256

Next, we multiply by 100 to convert this decimal to a percentage:

\[
0.86256 \times 100 \approx 86.256

E)81 km/h",A,"To determine the man's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and the total time he spent walking, and then use these to find the average speed.

1. **Calculate the distance for each part of the journey:**

   - **First part:** The man walks at 5 km/h for 6 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{km/h} \times 6 \, \text{h} = 30 \, \text{km}

A)2
B)3
C)4
D)5
E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.

1. **Understanding the Median**: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. If the median income is $3000, this means that when the incomes are listed in order, $3000 is the middle value.

2. **Total Income**: The total income of the family is $9000. This is the sum of all individual incomes in the family.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - If there are 2 members (Option A), the median would be the average of the two incomes. For the median to be $3000, one income would have to be less than or equal to $3000 and the other greater than or equal to $3000. However, the total income would be $6000, not $9000.
   - If there are 3 members (Option B), the median is the second income when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, the incomes could be $3000, $3000, and $3000, but this would only total $9000 if the incomes are $3000, $3000, and $3000, which is possible.
   - If there are 4 members (Option C), the median would be the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes would need to average to $3000. However, this would complicate reaching a total of $9000 without specific values.
   - If there are 5 members (Option D), the median is the third income. For the median to be $3000, the third income must be $3000. However, this would require specific values for the other incomes to total $9000.
   - If there are 6 members (Option E), the median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes would need to average to $3000, which again complicates reaching a total of $9000 without specific values.

4. **Conclusion**: The simplest scenario that fits all conditions is when there are 3 members, each earning $3000. This gives a total income of $9000 and a median of $3000, satisfying both conditions of the problem.

A)300
B)200
C)400
D)100
E)500",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of employees in the organization based on the given conditions about their contributions.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial Contribution:**
   - The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh.
   - Let the number of employees be \( n \).
   - Each employee contributes an equal amount, say Rs. \( x \).
   - Therefore, the total contribution is \( n \times x = 6,00,000 \).

2. **Increased Contribution:**
   - If each employee contributes Rs. 60 more, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh.
   - The new contribution per employee is \( x + 60 \).
   - Therefore, the total contribution with the increased amount is \( n \times (x + 60) = 6,24,000 \).

Now, we have two equations based on the above information:

1. \( n \times x = 6,00,000 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( n \times (x + 60) = 6,24,000 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations to find \( n \).

**Step 1: Express \( x \) from Equation 1:**

From Equation 1:
\[ x = \frac{6,00,000}{n} \]

**Step 2: Substitute \( x \) in Equation 2:**

Substitute \( x = \frac{6,00,000}{n} \) into Equation 2:
\[ n \times \left(\frac{6,00,000}{n} + 60\right) = 6,24,000 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( n \):**

Subtract 6,00,000 from both sides:
\[ 60n = 24,000 \]

Divide both sides by 60:
\[ n = \frac{24,000}{60} \]

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.

The diver earns:
- 20 cents for each copper coin, so \( 20x \) cents for \( x \) copper coins.
- 25 cents for each brass coin, so \( 25y \) cents for \( y \) brass coins.

The total earnings from one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) (the number of copper coins) that satisfies this equation with non-negative integer values for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:
\[ 4x + 5y = 68 \]

Now, we need to find integer solutions for this equation. We are particularly interested in minimizing \( x \).

To find the minimum \( x \), let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 5y = 68 - 4x \]
\[ y = \frac{68 - 4x}{5} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 68 - 4x \) must be divisible by 5. Let's check the values of \( x \) starting from the smallest possible integer (0) and increasing until we find the minimum \( x \) that results in an integer \( y \).

1. **\( x = 0 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(0)}{5} = \frac{68}{5} = 13.6 \] (not an integer)

2. **\( x = 1 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(1)}{5} = \frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \] (not an integer)

3. **\( x = 2 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{68 - 4(2)}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \] (integer)

Since \( y = 12 \) is an integer when \( x = 2 \), this is a valid solution. Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought is 2.

140,,"A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day, given the conditions described.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The store starts with 600 golf balls.
   - By the end of the day, 80% of the golf balls are sold.
   - The store sells an equal number of yellow and white golf balls.
   - All white golf balls are sold by the end of the day.

2. **Calculate the Number of Golf Balls Sold:**
   - 80% of 600 golf balls are sold.
   - Calculate 80% of 600: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   - Therefore, 480 golf balls are sold.

3. **Determine the Number of White Golf Balls:**
   - Since all white golf balls are sold and the number of yellow and white golf balls sold is equal, half of the 480 sold golf balls must be white.
   - Calculate the number of white golf balls sold:
     \[
     \frac{480}{2} = 240
     \]
   - Therefore, there were 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.

4. **Calculate the Number of Yellow Golf Balls:**
   - The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is 600.
   - Subtract the number of white golf balls from the total to find the number of yellow golf balls:
     \[
     600 - 240 = 360

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - The store had 360 yellow golf balls and 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.
   - It sold 240 yellow and 240 white golf balls, totaling 480 golf balls sold, which matches the 80% of 600 golf balls.

Thus, the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is 360.

A)12 metre
B)12.5 metre
C)13.5 metre
D)14 metre
E)15 metre",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the situation involves similar triangles. The flagstaff and its shadow form one right triangle, and the building and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar (same time of day, same sun angle), the triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

Given:
- Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
- Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
- Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

We need to find the height of the building, which we'll denote as \( h \).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the flagstaff should be equal to the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the building. Therefore, we can set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of flagstaff}}{\text{Shadow of flagstaff}} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{\text{Shadow of building}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{h}{28.75}
\]

To solve for \( h \), we cross-multiply:

\[
17.5 \times 28.75 = h \times 40.25
\]

Calculate \( 17.5 \times 28.75 \):

\[
17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125
\]

Now, solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{503.125}{40.25}

Perform the division:

\[
h = 12.5
\]

Thus, the height of the building is 12.5 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

   - We need to find the time it takes for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.

2. **Set up the relative speed**:
   - Since both cars are traveling in the same direction, the relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds.
   - Relative speed = Speed of Car 1 - Speed of Car 2 = 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.

- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)

We need to find \( P(B) \).

For independent events, the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is given by:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is:

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Substituting this into the formula for \( P(A \cup B) \), we get:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \times P(B) \]

We know \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \) and \( P(A) = 0.6 \). Plug these values into the equation:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]

\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:

\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. Therefore, the correct answer is:

   - We want to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color.

2. **Worst-case Scenario**:
   - To find the minimum number of ties needed to guarantee at least two of the same color, we should consider the worst-case scenario where we pick the maximum number of different colored ties without getting two of the same color.

First, let's determine the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP) of the oranges.

1. **Cost Price (CP):**
   The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. Therefore, the cost price is Rs. 450.

2. **Selling Price (SP):**
   The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg. Therefore, the selling price for 90 kg is:

C)1 hr 8 min
D)56 min
E)55 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time at which the two trains cross each other. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Train M**:
   - Leaves City A at 5 am.
   - Reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time = 4 hours.

2. **Train N**:
   - Leaves City B at 7 am.
   - Reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time = 3.5 hours.

To find when the trains cross each other, we need to determine their speeds and positions relative to each other over time.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Calculate the speeds of the trains**:
   - Assume the distance between City A and City B is \( D \).
   - Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \) (since it takes 4 hours to cover distance \( D \)).
   - Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} \) (since it takes 3.5 hours to cover distance \( D \)).

2. **Determine the relative positions of the trains**:
   - Train M starts at 5 am from City A.
   - Train N starts at 7 am from City B.

3. **Calculate the time when they meet**:
   - By 7 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours.
   - Distance covered by Train M in 2 hours = \( 2 \times \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{2} \).

   At 7 am, Train M is halfway to City B, and Train N starts its journey from City B.

4. **Relative speed of the trains**:
   - Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N.
   - Relative speed = \( \frac{D}{4} + \frac{D}{3.5} \).

   To simplify, convert the speeds to a common denominator:
   - Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} = \frac{7D}{28} \).
   - Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} = \frac{2D}{7} = \frac{8D}{28} \).

   Relative speed = \( \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \).

5. **Time taken to meet**:
   - They need to cover the remaining half of the distance \( \frac{D}{2} \) at their relative speed.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{\frac{15D}{28}} = \frac{D}{2} \times \frac{28}{15D} = \frac{28}{30} = \frac{14}{15} \) hours.

First, let's consider their individual biking rates:
- Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour.
- Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to calculate their combined rate of biking.

1. **Calculate the combined rate:**
   - Janice's rate is 10 miles per hour.
   - Jennie's rate is 20 miles per hour.
   - Together, their combined rate is \(10 + 20 = 30\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time to bike 1 mile collectively:**
   - Since their combined rate is 30 miles per hour, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile at this rate.
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and rate are known is: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Here, the distance is 1 mile, and the rate is 30 miles per hour.
   - Plugging in the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Convert the time from hours to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \(\frac{1}{30}\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:
     \[
     \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ minutes}

First, let's analyze the information given for the initial scenario:
- Jill bought 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people attending.

From this, we can calculate the ratio of bottles of soda per person:
\[ \text{Bottles per person} = \frac{10 \text{ bottles}}{8 \text{ people}} = 1.25 \text{ bottles per person} \]

Now, we need to apply this ratio to the new scenario where 12 people are attending the party. We will use the same ratio of 1.25 bottles per person to find out how many bottles are needed for 12 people:
\[ \text{Bottles needed} = 1.25 \text{ bottles/person} \times 12 \text{ people} = 15 \text{ bottles} \]

However, 15 bottles is not one of the options provided. This suggests that the problem might be interpreted differently, or there might be an assumption that the number of bottles needed is directly proportional to the number of people, without considering fractional bottles.

Let's consider the possibility that the number of bottles scales directly with the number of people, without fractional consideration. In the original scenario, 10 bottles were needed for 8 people. If we assume a direct proportionality:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ bottles}}{8 \text{ people}} = \frac{x \text{ bottles}}{12 \text{ people}} \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):
\[ 10 \times 12 = 8 \times x \]
\[ 120 = 8x \]

This is a classic problem involving similar triangles, where the ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is constant, assuming the light source (like the sun) is the same for both objects.

Given:
- The first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
- The second ant is 6 inches tall, and we need to find the length of its shadow.

First, we determine the ratio of the height of the first ant to the length of its shadow:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

This ratio should be the same for the second ant because the conditions (light source, surface, etc.) are the same. Therefore, we set up the equation for the second ant using the same ratio:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of second ant}}{\text{Shadow of second ant}} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the length of the shadow of the second ant. Then:
\[
\frac{6}{x} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[
6 \times 5 = 2 \times x
\]
\[
30 = 2x
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A)2.6m
B)3.9m
C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   The problem states that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. This means if the height is \( h \), then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{5}{2}h \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls**:
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters.
   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.

3. **Calculating the Total Area to be Papered**:
   - The cost of Rs. 260 at Rs. 2 per meter means that 130 meters of paper is used (since \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \)).
   - Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the total area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.

4. **Adjusting for Doors and Windows**:
   - The problem states that 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows.
   - Therefore, the actual area of the walls that needs to be papered is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) square meters.

5. **Relating the Area to the Room Dimensions**:
   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then the semi-perimeter is \( \frac{P}{2} \).
   - From the ratio, we have \( \frac{h}{\frac{P}{2}} = \frac{2}{5} \), which implies \( P = \frac{5}{2}h \times 2 = 5h \).

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The area of the walls is \( P \times h = 5h \times h = 5h^2 \).
   - We know this area is 80 square meters, so we set up the equation: \( 5h^2 = 80 \).

7. **Solving for \( h \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( h^2 = 16 \).
   - Take the square root of both sides: \( h = \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters. The correct answer is:

C)82
D)92
E)102",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of consecutive integers, \( k \), that sum up to 51, given that the smallest integer in this sequence is \(-50\).

Let's denote the sequence of \( k \) consecutive integers starting from \(-50\) as:
\[
-50, -49, -48, \ldots, (-50 + k - 1)
\]

The sum of these \( k \) consecutive integers can be expressed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Here, the first term is \(-50\) and the last term is \((-50 + k - 1)\). Therefore, the sum becomes:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 + (-50 + k - 1))
\]
\[
= \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 - 50 + k - 1)
\]
\[
= \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101)
\]

We know this sum equals 51:
\[
\frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101) = 51
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
\[
k \times (k - 101) = 102
\]

Expanding this equation gives:
\[
k^2 - 101k = 102
\]

Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation:
\[
k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0
\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102)
\]
\[
= 10201 + 408
\]
\[
= 10609
\]

The square root of 10609 is 103 (since \( 103^2 = 10609 \)).

Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}
\]

This gives two potential solutions:
1. \( k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = \frac{204}{2} = 102 \)
2. \( k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \)

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer (as it represents the number of integers), we discard \(-1\) and accept \( k = 102 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

1. **Total Number of Arrangements**: 
   - Without any restrictions, the 10 speakers can be arranged in \(10!\) different ways.

2. **Identifying the Key Speakers**:
   - We have three specific roles: pm, mp, and mla. The problem states that pm must speak before mp, and mp must speak before mla.

3. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements**:
   - For any specific arrangement of the 10 speakers, the pm, mp, and mla can be in any order among themselves. There are \(3!\) (which is 6) possible ways to arrange these three speakers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the original price of each article be \( x \).
   - The new price after a 15% decrease is \( 0.85x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Initially, Anna could buy a certain number of articles for $300 at the original price \( x \). The number of articles she could buy is \( \frac{300}{x} \).
   - After the price decrease, she can buy 5 more articles for the same $300. The number of articles she can now buy is \( \frac{300}{0.85x} \).

3. **Formulate the Relationship:**
   - The difference in the number of articles she can buy is 5:
     \[
     \frac{300}{0.85x} = \frac{300}{x} + 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Start by clearing the fractions by multiplying through by \( 0.85x \times x \):

1. **Initial Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let's assume the man's initial income is \( I \).
   - He spends 70% of his income, so his initial expenditure is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%. Therefore, his new income is:
     \[
     I_{\text{new}} = I + 0.2I = 1.2I

This means we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers: 28 (white tulips) and 98 (red tulips).

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. We can find the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated division and taking remainders.

1. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm:**

   - Start with the two numbers: 98 and 28.
   - Divide 98 by 28, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 14 (since 98 = 28 * 3 + 14).
   - Now, take the previous divisor (28) and divide it by the remainder (14).
   - Divide 28 by 14, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (since 28 = 14 * 2 + 0).

2. **Determine the GCD:**

   - When the remainder becomes 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD.
   - In this case, the remainder became 0 when we divided 28 by 14, so the GCD is 14.

3. **Interpret the result:**

   - The greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is equal to the GCD of 28 and 98, which is 14.

E)5 hours",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Sharon and Karen need to work together to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. We know that Sharon can earn enough in 5 hours, and Karen can earn enough in 4 hours.

First, let's define the rate at which each person earns tips:

- Sharon's rate: She earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 5 hours. Therefore, her rate is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of a cake per hour.
- Karen's rate: She earns 1 cake's worth of tips in 4 hours. Therefore, her rate is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a cake per hour.

When they work together, their rates add up. So, the combined rate at which they earn tips is:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. Therefore, we convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{20}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{4}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{9}{20}

3. \( |x^3| > |y^2| \)

Let's break down each condition:

- \( x < 0 \): This means \( x \) is a negative number.
- \( y > 0 \): This means \( y \) is a positive number.
- \( |x^3| > |y^2| \): This means the absolute value of \( x^3 \) is greater than the absolute value of \( y^2 \).

Since \( x \) is negative, \( x^3 \) will also be negative (because a negative number raised to an odd power remains negative). Therefore, \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).

Since \( y \) is positive, \( y^2 \) will also be positive, and \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

(B) \( y^2 > x^2 \): Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we cannot directly compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) without additional information. This option is not necessarily true.

(C) \(-x^3 < y^2\): We have already established that \(-x^3 > y^2\) from the condition \(|x^3| > |y^2|\). This option is false.

- Ant A's speed is 9 cm per hour.
- Ant B's speed is 6 cm per hour.
- The total distance between the two farms is 75 cm.

Since both ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to find the rate at which the distance between them is decreasing. The combined speed of the two ants is:

\[ 9 \, \text{cm/hour} + 6 \, \text{cm/hour} = 15 \, \text{cm/hour} \]

This means that the distance between the two ants decreases by 15 cm every hour. To find out how long it takes for them to meet, we divide the total distance by their combined speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Combined Speed}} = \frac{75 \, \text{cm}}{15 \, \text{cm/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now that we know it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet, we can calculate how far ant A travels in that time. Since ant A travels at a speed of 9 cm per hour, the distance ant A travels is:

\[ \text{Distance traveled by Ant A} = \text{Speed of Ant A} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{cm} \]

D)7 Trousers
E)11 Trousers",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trousers and shirts the man can buy with a total of Rs 810, given the prices of each item. The goal is to maximize the number of trousers purchased.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of trousers.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of shirts.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The cost of \( T \) trousers is \( 70T \).
   - The cost of \( S \) shirts is \( 30S \).
   - The total cost is given as Rs 810, so the equation is:
     \[
     70T + 30S = 810
     \]

3. **Maximize Trousers:**
   - We want to maximize \( T \), so we should first solve for \( S \) in terms of \( T \) and then find the maximum integer value of \( T \).

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify:
     \[
     7T + 3S = 81
     \]

5. **Find Maximum \( T \):**
   - To maximize \( T \), we need to minimize \( S \). Since \( S \) must be a non-negative integer, we start by setting \( S = 0 \) and check if \( T \) is an integer:
     \[
     7T = 81 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = \frac{81}{7} \approx 11.57
     \]
   - Since \( T \) must be an integer, the maximum integer value less than or equal to 11.57 is 11.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( T = 11 \), then:
     \[
     7 \times 11 + 3S = 81 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 77 + 3S = 81 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3S = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = \frac{4}{3}
     \]
   - Since \( S \) is not an integer, \( T = 11 \) is not possible.

7. **Try \( T = 10 \):**
   - If \( T = 10 \), then:
     \[
     7 \times 10 + 3S = 81 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 70 + 3S = 81 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3S = 11 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = \frac{11}{3}

   - Again, \( S \) is not an integer.

8. **Try \( T = 9 \):**
   - If \( T = 9 \), then:

A)$7.73
B)$6.73
C)$5.73
D)$4.73
E)$3.73",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cover price per issue of the magazine. We are given that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and this price represents a saving of 25% off the cover prices.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Savings**: 
   - The subscription price of $42.00 is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues.
   - This means that $42.00 is 75% (100% - 25%) of the total cover price for 15 issues.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the cover price per issue.
   - Therefore, the total cover price for 15 issues is \( 15x \).

3. **Relating Subscription Price to Cover Price**:
   - Since $42.00 is 75% of the total cover price, we can write the equation:
     \[
     0.75 \times 15x = 42
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - First, solve for \( 15x \) by dividing both sides by 0.75:
     \[
     15x = \frac{42}{0.75}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \frac{42}{0.75} \):
     \[
     15x = 56

5. **Finding the Cover Price per Issue**:
   - Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 15:
     \[
     x = \frac{56}{15}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \frac{56}{15} \):
     \[
     x \approx 3.73

B)23
C)16
D)18
E)12",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the coin landed on heads such that neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money after 20 flips.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin lands on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin lands on tails.

According to the problem:
- Each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan.
- Each time the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher.

The total number of flips is 20, so:
\[ H + T = 20 \]

The net amount exchanged should be zero since neither won or lost any money:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

From the second equation, we can express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute \( T = \frac{2H}{3} \) into the first equation:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:
\[ 3H + 2H = 60 \]
\[ 5H = 60 \]

Solve for \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.

B)72 km
C)126km
D)84 km
E)48km",E,"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movements of Allen and Bob and determine the distance between X and Y based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time from opposite points (X and Y) and travel towards each other.
   - Allen travels at 54 kmph, and Bob travels at 78 kmph.
   - They meet for the first time somewhere between X and Y.
   - After meeting, Allen continues to Y and then returns to X, while Bob continues to X and then returns to Y.
   - They meet for the second time, and by this time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let the distance between X and Y be \( D \) km.
   - When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances they have traveled is \( D \).
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time taken to meet for the first time.
     - Allen's distance: \( 54t_1 \)
     - Bob's distance: \( 78t_1 \)
     - Equation: \( 54t_1 + 78t_1 = D \)
     - Simplifying: \( 132t_1 = D \)
     - Therefore, \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \).

3. **Second Meeting:**
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time from the first meeting to the second meeting.
   - By the second meeting, Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.
   - Total distance Allen travels by the second meeting: \( 54(t_1 + t_2) \)
   - Total distance Bob travels by the second meeting: \( 78(t_1 + t_2) \)
   - Given: \( 78(t_1 + t_2) = 54(t_1 + t_2) + 48 \)
   - Simplifying: \( 24(t_1 + t_2) = 48 \)
   - Therefore, \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \).

4. **Substituting \( t_1 \):**
   - We know \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \).
   - Substitute into \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \):
     - \( \frac{D}{132} + t_2 = 2 \)
     - \( t_2 = 2 - \frac{D}{132} \).

5. **Solving for \( D \):**
   - From \( 24(t_1 + t_2) = 48 \), we have \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \).
   - Substitute \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \) into \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \):
     - \( \frac{D}{132} + (2 - \frac{D}{132}) = 2 \)
     - This equation is consistent, confirming \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \) is correct.
   - Now, solve for \( D \) using \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \) and \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \):
     - \( \frac{D}{132} + 2 - \frac{D}{132} = 2 \)

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - The cost of purchasing new tires is $180 per tire.
   - These new tires last for 4 years.
   - Therefore, the average cost per year for new tires is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per year for new tires} = \frac{\text{Total cost of new tires}}{\text{Number of years they last}} = \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ dollars per year}

The goal is to find the digits represented by the letters M, A, D, B, E, R, and I such that the multiplication is correct. We are given several choices for the number represented by the letters M, A, D, and B.

Let's break down the multiplication:

1. **M A D × E = R A E**: This implies that the last digit of M A D multiplied by E gives a number ending in E. This is a clue to the possible values of D and E.

   - We are given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 metres. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
   - Therefore, \( 2(l + w) = 340 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( l + w = 170 \).

2. **Calculating the Area of the Boundary:**
   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the entire plot. This means the boundary forms a larger rectangle around the original plot.
   - The dimensions of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) will be \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \) because the boundary adds 1 metre to each side of the length and width.

3. **Area of the Larger Rectangle:**
   - The area of the larger rectangle is \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \).

4. **Area of the Original Rectangle:**
   - The area of the original rectangle is \( l \times w \).

5. **Area of the Boundary:**
   - The area of the boundary is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the original rectangle:
   \[
   \text{Area of boundary} = (l + 2)(w + 2) - lw
   \]
   \[
   = lw + 2l + 2w + 4 - lw
   \]
   \[
   = 2l + 2w + 4
   \]
   - Since \( l + w = 170 \), we substitute:
   \[
   = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344
   \]

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost of gardening is given at the rate of 10 per square metre.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 344 \times 10 = 3440 \).

Thus, the cost of gardening the boundary is 3440. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Identify the percentage of revenue from novels:**
   - We know that 34% of the company's sales revenue came from novels.

2. **Calculate the remaining revenue:**
   - Since 34% of the revenue is from novels, the remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%.

3. **Determine the revenue from biographies:**
   - Of this remaining 66% revenue, 1/3 comes from biographies.
   - Therefore, the revenue from biographies is (1/3) * 66% = 22%.

E)32000",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers the bee flies by in order to bypass 8 flowers, given that it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters.

First, let's understand what it means to bypass 0.05% of the flowers. This percentage indicates that for every 100 flowers the bee flies by, it bypasses 0.05 flowers. To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up a proportion based on this percentage.

The proportion can be set up as follows:

\[
\frac{0.05}{100} = \frac{8}{x}
\]

Where:
- \(0.05\) is the percentage of flowers bypassed per 100 flowers.
- \(8\) is the number of flowers we want the bee to bypass.
- \(x\) is the total number of flowers the bee flies by.

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
0.05 \times x = 8 \times 100
\]

\[
0.05x = 800

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.05:

\[
x = \frac{800}{0.05}

D)5C6*4C5
E)4C3*4C3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how Fernando can allocate his 3 lunches and 3 dinners during the weekdays, given the constraints.

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so Fernando can only have meals from Monday to Friday.
   - He has 3 lunches and 3 dinners to allocate.
   - He goes home for dinner on Friday nights, meaning he cannot have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday.

2. **Allocating Lunches:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and Fernando needs to choose 3 days to have lunch. This is a combination problem where we choose 3 days out of 5. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{3} \).

3. **Allocating Dinners:**
   - Since Fernando goes home for dinner on Friday, he can only have dinner from Monday to Thursday.
   - He needs to choose 3 days to have dinner out of these 4 available days. This is another combination problem where we choose 3 days out of 4. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{3} \).

4. **Calculating the Combinations:**
   - For lunches: \( \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \).

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

1. **Recognize the difference of squares**: The numerator \(a^2 - b^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:

   \[
   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

   \[
   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b}
   \]

4. **Check the simplified expression**: After canceling, the expression simplifies to:

   \[
   a - b
   \]

Now, compare this with the right side of the equation, which is \((a - b)^2\).

The simplified left side, \(a - b\), does not match \((a - b)^2\). Therefore, the expression does not simplify to the right side as given in the problem.

Let's evaluate the options:

- **Option A**: \((a + b)(a - b)\) simplifies to \(a^2 - b^2\), which is not equal to \((a - b)^2\).
- **Option B**: \((a - b)^2\) is the right side of the equation, but the left side simplifies to \(a - b\), not \((a - b)^2\).
- **Option C**: \((a + b)^2\) is not relevant to the simplification.
- **Option D**: \(a^3 + b^3\) is not relevant to the simplification.
- **Option E**: ""None of these"" is a possibility if none of the options match the simplification.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**
   - We are looking for a number, let's call it \( x \).
   - The number \( x \) is ""as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86.""

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The phrase ""as much greater than 36"" can be expressed as \( x - 36 \).
   - The phrase ""as much less than 86"" can be expressed as \( 86 - x \).
   - According to the problem, these two expressions are equal:
     \[
     x - 36 = 86 - x
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Start by adding \( x \) to both sides to eliminate the negative \( x \) on the right:
     \[
     x - 36 + x = 86 - x + x
     \]
     \[
     2x - 36 = 86
     \]
   - Next, add 36 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x - 36 + 36 = 86 + 36
     \]
     \[
     2x = 122

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the structure of a crate:**
   - Each crate contains \( p \) pallets.
   - Each pallet holds 1250 phones.

2. **Calculate the number of phones in one crate:**
   - Since each pallet holds 1250 phones, the number of phones in one crate is:
     \[
     \text{Number of phones in one crate} = p \times 1250

3. **Calculate the number of phones in 4 crates:**
   - If one crate contains \( p \times 1250 \) phones, then 4 crates will contain:
     \[
     \text{Number of phones in 4 crates} = 4 \times (p \times 1250) = 4p \times 1250

A)20 min
B)22 min
C)23 min
D)21 min
E)20 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for both A and B to construct the wall together. We are given the individual times it takes for each person to complete the task alone: A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, and B can construct it in 45 minutes.

First, we calculate the rate at which each person works. The rate is the reciprocal of the time it takes to complete the task:

- A's rate of work is \( \frac{1}{40} \) of the wall per minute.
- B's rate of work is \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

When A and B work together, their rates of work add up. Therefore, the combined rate of work is:

\[
\frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360. We convert each rate to have this common denominator:

- A's rate: \( \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360} \)
- B's rate: \( \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360} \)

Adding these rates together gives:

\[
\frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360}
\]

This combined rate of \( \frac{17}{360} \) means that together, A and B can construct \( \frac{17}{360} \) of the wall per minute. To find out how long it takes them to construct the entire wall, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{360}{17} \text{ minutes}

E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel. The key is to understand that the train must travel its own length plus the length of the tunnel to completely pass through it.

1. **Determine the length of the train:**
   - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. This means that in 3 seconds, the entire length of the train has entered the tunnel.
   - The speed of the train is 120 miles per hour. We need to convert this speed into miles per second to match the time unit given in the problem.
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so the speed of the train in miles per second is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ miles/hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}

   - In 3 seconds, the train travels:
     \[
     3 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second} = \frac{3}{30} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel:**
   - The train needs to travel its own length plus the length of the tunnel.
   - The length of the tunnel is 1 mile, and the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.
   - Total distance to travel = \(1 + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}\).

3. **Calculate the time to travel the total distance:**
   - We already know the speed of the train is \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles per second.
   - Time to travel \(\frac{11}{10}\) miles is:

E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the terms of the invoice and how they relate to the discount and interest rate.

The invoice terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

1. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   - The original invoice amount is $20,000.
   - A 4% discount on $20,000 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800
     \]
   - Therefore, the discounted price is:
     \[
     20,000 - 800 = 19,200
     \]

2. **Determine the Savings from the Discount:**
   - By paying $19,200 within 30 days, the merchant saves $800 compared to paying the full $20,000 after 100 days.

3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - The time difference between paying within 30 days and paying at the end of 100 days is:
     \[
     100 - 30 = 70 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Equivalent Simple Interest Rate:**
   - The merchant effectively saves $800 over 70 days by taking the discount.
   - To find the equivalent annual simple interest rate, we need to calculate the interest rate that would result in $800 interest on a $19,200 loan over 70 days.
   - The formula for simple interest is:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{\text{Time}}{365}

The problem states that the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

We are given that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the value of one part in the ratio:

- Let \( x \) be the weight of one part in pounds.

   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - 90% of \( x \) = 7200, so \( 0.9x = 7200 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \).

4. **Calculate the Total Manufacturing Cost:**
   - The company makes a 25% profit on the total manufacturing cost.
   - Let \( C \) be the manufacturing cost per pen.
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 8000 \times C \).
   - Profit = 25% of the total manufacturing cost = \( 0.25 \times 8000 \times C \).
   - Total revenue = Total manufacturing cost + Profit.
   - Therefore, \( 72000 = 8000C + 0.25 \times 8000C \).

5. **Solve for the Manufacturing Cost per Pen:**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 72000 = 8000C + 2000C \).
   - \( 72000 = 10000C \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{72000}{10000} = 7.2 \).

6. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Rs. 7.2.",True,,,,,

A)12
B)24
C)42
D)48
E)49",B,"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given conditions into mathematical equations and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote the digit in the ten's place as \( x \) and the digit in the unit's place as \( y \). Since the number is a two-digit number, it can be expressed as \( 10x + y \).

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. This can be written as:
\[ 10x + y = (x + y) + 18 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ 10x + y = x + y + 18 \]
\[ 10x + y - x - y = 18 \]
\[ 9x = 18 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{18}{9} = 2 \]

Now that we know \( x = 2 \), we can use the second condition given in the problem: the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. This means:
\[ y = 2x \]

Substituting \( x = 2 \) into this equation, we find:
\[ y = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Now we have both digits: the ten's place digit \( x = 2 \) and the unit's place digit \( y = 4 \). Therefore, the number is:
\[ 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)
D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)
E)None",D,"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expressions \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \) and \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \), where \([x]\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**
   - \([x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).
   - For example, if \( x = 2.3 \), then \([x] = 2\).

2. **Expression for \( L(x, y) \):**
   - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \).
   - \([x]\) and \([y]\) are straightforward.
   - \([x + y]\) depends on the sum of \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Expression for \( R(x, y) \):**
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \).
   - This involves doubling \( x \) and \( y \) before applying the floor function.

4. **Comparing \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \):**
   - We need to determine if there are any conditions under which \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \), \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \), \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \), or \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \).

5. **Exploring the Possibilities:**
   - Consider \( x = 0.5 \) and \( y = 0.5 \):
     - \( [x] = 0 \), \( [y] = 0 \), \( [x + y] = [1.0] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( L(x, y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).
     - \( [2x] = [1.0] = 1 \), \( [2y] = [1.0] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( R(x, y) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
     - Here, \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \).

   - Consider \( x = 0.3 \) and \( y = 0.7 \):
     - \( [x] = 0 \), \( [y] = 0 \), \( [x + y] = [1.0] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( L(x, y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).
     - \( [2x] = [0.6] = 0 \), \( [2y] = [1.4] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( R(x, y) = 0 + 1 = 1 \).
     - Here, \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \).

   - Consider \( x = 0.6 \) and \( y = 0.6 \):
     - \( [x] = 0 \), \( [y] = 0 \), \( [x + y] = [1.2] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( L(x, y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).
     - \( [2x] = [1.2] = 1 \), \( [2y] = [1.2] = 1 \).
     - Thus, \( R(x, y) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
     - Here, \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - From the examples, we see that \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \) is possible, as well as \( L(x, y) < R(x, y) \).
   - However, \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \) does not seem possible with positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

Therefore, the correct answer is that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) for which \( L(x, y) > R(x, y) \).

194,,"Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?
A)After 6 minutes
B)After 12 minutes
C)After 18 minutes
D)After 24 minutes
E)none",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when the three bells will ring together again. This occurs at the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which they ring. The intervals given are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

Let's break down the process to find the LCM of these numbers:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 36 can be factored into prime numbers as: \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\).
   - 40 can be factored into prime numbers as: \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\).
   - 48 can be factored into prime numbers as: \(48 = 2^4 \times 3\).

2. **Determine the LCM**:
   - For the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - The prime number 2 appears with the highest power of 4 (from 48).
   - The prime number 3 appears with the highest power of 2 (from 36).
   - The prime number 5 appears with the highest power of 1 (from 40).

   Therefore, the LCM is calculated as:
   \[
   LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 16 \times 9 \times 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - First, calculate \(16 \times 9 = 144\).
   - Then, calculate \(144 \times 5 = 720\).

Thus, the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 is 720 seconds.

4. **Convert Seconds to Minutes**:
   - Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, we convert 720 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \frac{720}{60} = 12 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

A)21
B)22
C)20
D)23
E)24",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the situation involves similar triangles. The electric pole and its shadow form one right triangle, and the tree and its shadow form another right triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

Given:
- Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
- Shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters
- Shadow of the tree = 15 meters

We need to find the height of the tree, which we'll denote as \( h \).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of pole}}{\text{Shadow of pole}} = \frac{\text{Height of tree}}{\text{Shadow of tree}}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\frac{14}{10} = \frac{h}{15}
\]

To find \( h \), we solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:

\[
14 \times 15 = 10 \times h
\]

\[
210 = 10h
\]

Now, divide both sides by 10 to solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{210}{10} = 21

Thus, the height of the tree is 21 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. Orange costs 18 dollars.
2. Pineapple costs 27 dollars.
3. Grape costs 15 dollars.

One possible approach is to look for a pattern based on the number of letters in each fruit's name:

- ""Orange"" has 6 letters, and it costs 18 dollars.
- ""Pineapple"" has 9 letters, and it costs 27 dollars.
- ""Grape"" has 5 letters, and it costs 15 dollars.

Notice that the cost of each fruit is 3 times the number of letters in its name:

- For ""Orange"": 6 letters × 3 = 18 dollars.
- For ""Pineapple"": 9 letters × 3 = 27 dollars.
- For ""Grape"": 5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars.

The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|

For the given triangle, the vertices are \((a,0)\), \((b,0)\), and \((x,y)\). Plugging these into the formula, we have:

- \(x_1 = a\), \(y_1 = 0\)
- \(x_2 = b\), \(y_2 = 0\)
- \(x_3 = x\), \(y_3 = y\)

1. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - The car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hr = 1200 km.

2. **Determine the Required Speed for 10 Hours:**

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Formula for Simple Interest (SI):**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Total files = 250
   - Files infected only by a worm = 2.5 times the files infected by both a virus and a worm.
   - 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
   - Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5x \).
   - Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, 50% of 250 files = 125 files were not infected by a virus.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Current Ages and Time to Maturity:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will reach 26 in 3 years.
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will reach 26 in 2 years.

2. **Compound Interest Formula:**
   The compound interest formula is given by:

   For Mohan, the amount after 3 years will be:
   \[
   A_M = M \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = M \times 1.124864

   We want these amounts to be equal when they reach 26 years of age:
   \[
   M \times 1.124864 = (5100 - M) \times 1.0816
   \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   1.124864M = 5100 \times 1.0816 - 1.0816M
   \]
   \[
   1.124864M + 1.0816M = 5512.16

E)3y/(wx)",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes it will take for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain, given that the liquid passes through at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.

First, let's understand the rate of flow:
- The rate of flow is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds.
- To find the rate in gallons per second, we divide the rate by x: (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain at this rate:
- The time in seconds to pass y gallons is given by the formula: time (in seconds) = total gallons / rate of flow.
- So, time (in seconds) = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = 25xy/w seconds.

Since the problem asks for the time in minutes, we need to convert seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the time in seconds by 60 to convert it to minutes.
- Time (in minutes) = (25xy/w) / 60 = 25xy/(60w).

Simplifying the expression:
- 25xy/(60w) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
- (25xy/5) / (60w/5) = 5xy / (12w).

Thus, the time in minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain is 5xy/(12w).

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The original coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver.
   - The dimensions of the original coin are 2 mm thick and 15 mm in diameter.
   - The weight of the original coin is 30 grams.
   - The volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver.
   - Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.

2. **Calculate the volume of the original coin:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or thickness in this case).
   - For the original coin, the radius \( r = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm and the thickness \( h = 2 \) mm.
   - Therefore, the volume of the original coin is:
     \[
     V = \pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

3. **Determine the volume of aluminum and silver in the original coin:**
   - Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, each occupies half of the total volume.
   - Volume of aluminum = Volume of silver = \(\frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi\) cubic mm.

4. **Relate the weight to the volume:**
   - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_a \) and the density of silver be \( \rho_s \).
   - Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, \( \rho_s = 2\rho_a \).
   - The weight of the aluminum part is \( \rho_a \times 56.25\pi \).
   - The weight of the silver part is \( 2\rho_a \times 56.25\pi \).
   - The total weight of the coin is the sum of the weights of aluminum and silver:
     \[
     \rho_a \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_a \times 56.25\pi = 3\rho_a \times 56.25\pi = 30 \text{ grams}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \rho_a \):
     \[
     3\rho_a \times 56.25\pi = 30 \implies \rho_a = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi}
     \]

5. **Calculate the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum:**
   - The new coin has dimensions 1 mm thick and 30 mm in diameter.
   - The radius of the new coin is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm.
   - The volume of the new coin is:
     \[
     V_{\text{new}} = \pi \times (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]
   - Since the new coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight is:
     \[
     \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \rho_a \times 225\pi = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi = \frac{10 \times 225}{56.25} = 40 \text{ grams}

E)220",C,"To solve the problem, we need to translate the word problem into a mathematical equation and then solve for the unknown number.

Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \).

The problem states: ""If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.""

1. **Translate the problem into an equation:**

   - ""2/3 of a number"" can be expressed as \( \frac{2}{3}x \).
   - ""10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number"" translates to \( \frac{2}{3}x - 10 \).
   - ""The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number"" translates to \( 40 + \frac{1}{3}x \).

   Therefore, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x
   \]

2. **Solve the equation:**

   - First, eliminate the fractions by multiplying every term by 3 to clear the denominators:
     \[
     3 \left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3 \left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2x - 30 = 120 + x
     \]

   - Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     2x - x - 30 = 120
     \]
     Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     x - 30 = 120
     \]

   - Finally, add 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 120 + 30
     \]
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

3. **Verify the solution:**

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the original condition to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     - Calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \).
     - Subtract 10 from 100: \( 100 - 10 = 90 \).
     - Calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50 \).
     - Add 40 to 50: \( 40 + 50 = 90 \).

   Both sides of the equation equal 90, confirming that our solution is correct.

D)8
E)12",C,"To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\) will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0
\]

In the given equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We need this discriminant to be greater than zero for the roots to be real and distinct:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Solving this inequality for \(k\), we subtract 25 from both sides:

\[
-4k > -25
\]

Next, divide both sides by -4, remembering to reverse the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative number:

\[
k < \frac{25}{4}
\]

Calculating \(\frac{25}{4}\), we get:

\[
\frac{25}{4} = 6.25
\]

Since \(k\) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of \(k\) for which the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots is 6.

However, upon reviewing the options provided, 6 is not listed. The next step is to verify if there is a mistake or if the options are incorrect. The options given are:

A) 9  
B) 7  
C) 3

E) 12  

Since none of these options match our calculated value of 6, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to ensure that the discriminant is positive for the largest possible integer value of \(k\) from the given options.

Let's check the largest possible value from the options that satisfies the condition \(25 - 4k > 0\):

- For \(k = 7\), \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 7 = 25 - 28 = -3\) (not valid)
- For \(k = 8\), \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 8 = 25 - 32 = -7\) (not valid)
- For \(k = 9\), \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 9 = 25 - 36 = -11\) (not valid)
- For \(k = 3\), \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 3 = 25 - 12 = 13\) (valid)
- For \(k = 12\), \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 12 = 25 - 48 = -23\) (not valid)

A)9 hours.
B)10 hours.
C)11 hours.
D)12 hours.
E)13 hours.",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km, considering both her riding speed and her rest breaks.

1. **Calculate the time taken to ride 15 km:**
   - Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour.
   - To find the time taken to ride 15 km, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/h}} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - We divide the total distance by the segment distance: 
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ km}}{15 \text{ km}} \approx 6.67
     \]
   - This means Shweta can complete 6 full segments of 15 km, and there will be a remaining distance to cover.

3. **Calculate the total time for the 6 full segments:**
   - For each 15 km segment, Shweta takes 1.5 hours to ride and then rests for 10 minutes (which is \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) hours).
   - Total time per segment = 1.5 hours + \(\frac{1}{6}\) hours = \(\frac{9}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3}\) hours.
   - For 6 segments, the total time is:
     \[
     6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ hours}

4. **Calculate the time for the remaining distance:**
   - After 6 segments, Shweta has covered \(6 \times 15 = 90\) km.
   - She has 10 km left to cover.
   - Time to cover the remaining 10 km at 10 km/h is:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/h}} = 1 \text{ hour}

5. **Add up the total time:**
   - Total time for 6 segments = 10 hours.

C)16 hrs
D)20 hrs
E)13 hrs",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it would take for Mr. Sam to travel both ways by car, given the information about his travel times by train and car.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go to the city by train and return by car.
2. If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the train-car combination.

From point 2, we can deduce that the round trip by train takes 17 + 4 = 21 hours.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the time taken to travel one way by train.
- \( C \) as the time taken to travel one way by car.

From the information given:
- The round trip by train takes 21 hours, so \( 2T = 21 \). Therefore, \( T = 10.5 \) hours.
- The train-car combination takes 17 hours, so \( T + C = 17 \).

Now, we know \( T = 10.5 \) hours. Substituting this into the equation \( T + C = 17 \):

\[ 10.5 + C = 17 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 \]

So, the time taken to travel one way by car is 6.5 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it would take if Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car:

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **8:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) of the original amount.

2. **9:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, which is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original amount.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) - (2/9) = (6/9) - (2/9) = 4/9 of the original amount.

3. **10:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, which is (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original amount.
   - Remaining food = (4/9) - (4/27) = (12/27) - (4/27) = 8/27 of the original amount.

4. **11:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, which is (1/3) * (8/27) = 8/81 of the original amount.
   - Remaining food = (8/27) - (8/81) = (24/81) - (8/81) = 16/81 of the original amount.

   - 60% of the survey participants were women.
   - 40% of the survey participants were men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).
   - 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars.
   - 10 men preferred green cars over red cars.

2. **Determine the number of men who preferred green cars:**
   - If 75% of the men preferred red cars, then 25% of the men preferred green cars (since 100% - 75% = 25%).
   - We know that 10 men preferred green cars, which represents 25% of the men surveyed.

3. **Calculate the total number of men surveyed:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of men surveyed.
   - Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we have the equation: \( 0.25x = 10 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 10 / 0.25 = 40 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of people surveyed:**
   - Since 40% of the survey participants were men, and we found that there were 40 men, we can set up the equation: \( 0.4 \times \text{Total People} = 40 \).
   - Let \( y \) be the total number of people surveyed.
   - Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 40 / 0.4 = 100 \).

This is because the boy can reach the nth step by either taking a single step from the (n-1)th step or a double step from the (n-2)th step.

Let's denote the number of ways to reach the nth step as \( f(n) \). The recurrence relation is:
\[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]

We need initial conditions to start the sequence:
- \( f(1) = 1 \): There is only one way to reach the first step, which is by taking a single step.
- \( f(2) = 2 \): There are two ways to reach the second step: either by taking two single steps (1+1) or one double step (2).

Now, we can calculate the number of ways to reach each subsequent step up to the 10th step:

1. \( f(1) = 1 \)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Composition**: 
   - The initial 1-gallon mixture contains 40% orange juice and 60% water.
   - This means there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water in the mixture.

2. **Goal**:
   - We want the final mixture to be 60% orange juice.

   - After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice will be \( 0.4 + x \) gallons.
   - The total volume of the mixture will be \( 1 + x \) gallons (since we are adding only orange juice).

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the final mixture:
   \[
   \frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
   \]
   - Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x

2. **Number of Horses Mr. Jain Selects**: Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random.

3. **Probability of Selecting the Winning Horse**: We need to find the probability that at least one of the two horses Mr. Jain selects is the winning horse.

To find this probability, we can use the concept of complementary probability:

- **Complementary Event**: The complementary event to Mr. Jain selecting the winning horse is that he does not select the winning horse at all. This means both horses he selects are not the winning horse.

- **Number of Ways to Select 2 Non-Winning Horses**: If there is 1 winning horse, there are 4 non-winning horses. The number of ways to select 2 horses from these 4 non-winning horses is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{2} \).

  \[
  \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
  \]

- **Total Number of Ways to Select Any 2 Horses from 5**: The total number of ways to select any 2 horses from the 5 horses is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{2} \).

  \[
  \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
  \]

- **Probability of Not Selecting the Winning Horse**: The probability that Mr. Jain does not select the winning horse (i.e., selects 2 non-winning horses) is the ratio of the number of ways to select 2 non-winning horses to the total number of ways to select any 2 horses.

  \[
  P(\text{not selecting winning horse}) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
  \]

- **Probability of Selecting the Winning Horse**: The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the complement of the probability of not selecting the winning horse.

  \[
  P(\text{selecting winning horse}) = 1 - P(\text{not selecting winning horse}) = 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
  \]

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

A)10
B)11
C)12
D)13
E)14",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when both 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875 should be divisible by \( N \).

First, calculate the difference between the two numbers:

\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]

This means that \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers.

Let's start by checking if 1397 is a prime number or if it has any divisors. We can do this by testing divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 1397.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 1397 is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), which is not divisible by 3.
3. **Check divisibility by 5**: 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
4. **Check divisibility by 7**: Perform the division \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \), which is not an integer, so 1397 is not divisible by 7.
5. **Check divisibility by 11**: The alternating sum of the digits is \( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \), which is divisible by 11. So, 1397 is divisible by 11.

Now, divide 1397 by 11:

\[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]

This means 1397 can be expressed as \( 11 \times 127 \).

Both 11 and 127 are prime numbers. Since we are looking for a 3-digit number, \( N \) must be 127, as 11 is not a 3-digit number.

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of \( N = 127 \):

\[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \]

Therefore, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 10.

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed?
A)44%
B)66%
C)68%
D)72%
E)75%",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of students who passed the test based on the given averages.

Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the percentage of students who passed the test.
- \( f \) as the percentage of students who failed the test.

Since the total percentage of students must add up to 100%, we have:
\[ p + f = 100 \]

We are given:
- The average score of the passing students is 83.
- The average score of the failing students is 55.
- The overall class average is 76.

The overall class average can be expressed as a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55f}{100} \]

Substituting \( f = 100 - p \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55(100 - p)}{100} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 5500 - 55p}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{(83p - 55p) + 5500}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{28p + 5500}{100} \]

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 7600 = 28p + 5500 \]

Subtract 5500 from both sides to isolate the term with \( p \):
\[ 2100 = 28p \]

Divide both sides by 28 to solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{2100}{28} \]
\[ p = 75 \]

Thus, 75% of the class passed the test. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The number of factors of a positive integer \( Q \) can be determined from its prime factorization. If \( Q = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) are distinct prime numbers and \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) are positive integers, then the number of factors of \( Q \) is given by:

2. **With Membership:**
   - Membership cost = $7.00 per month
   - Cost per DVD = $2.00
   - Total cost for renting \( x \) DVDs = \( 7 + 2x \)

We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the cost with the membership is less than or equal to the cost without the membership:

\[ 7 + 2x \leq 4x \]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):

A)4
B)8
C)22
D)50
E)20",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the yacht cleaning work, given her cleaning rate.

1. **Understand Jack's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his cleaning rate is 1 yacht per 12 hours, or \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Determine the Work Jack Completed:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means he has completed \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the yacht.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Work:**
   - Since Jack completed \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the work, the remaining work is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht.

4. **Determine Jill's Cleaning Rate:**
   - Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the yacht per hour.
   - Therefore, Jill's rate is \(0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{240}\) of the yacht per hour.

5. **Calculate the Time for Jill to Complete the Remaining Work:**
   - Jill needs to complete \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht.
   - If Jill's rate is \(\frac{1}{240}\) of the yacht per hour, the time \(t\) it takes her to complete \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the yacht is given by:
     \[
     \frac{1}{240} \times t = \frac{1}{3}

- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 5000 in this case),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years (3 years here).

We are given that the simple interest accrued over 3 years is Rs. 300. We need to find the rate of interest \( R \).

Plugging the known values into the formula, we have:

\[ 300 = \frac{5000 \times R \times 3}{100} \]

To solve for \( R \), we first simplify the equation:

\[ 300 = \frac{15000 \times R}{100} \]

Let's denote the original selling price of the article as \( x \).

The problem states that a 20% discount was applied, which means Vinit paid 80% of the original price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ 0.8x = 4578 \]

To find the original price \( x \), we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

Divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:
\[ x = \frac{4578}{0.8} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = 4578 \div 0.8 \]

To simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal:
\[ x = \frac{45780}{8} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ x = 5722.5 \]

Since the original selling price should be a whole number (as prices are typically not in fractions of a currency unit), we round 5722.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 5723.

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article before the discount was applied is Rs.5723.

1. **Identify the types of candy bars and their costs:**
   - 3 candy bars cost 50 cents each.
   - 4 candy bars cost $1 each.
   - 4 candy bars cost $2 each.

2. **Convert all costs to cents for simplicity:**
   - 50 cents = 0.5 dollars, so 50 cents = 50 cents.
   - $1 = 100 cents.
   - $2 = 200 cents.

3. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11:**
   - The total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.
   - C(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * 8!) = (11 * 10 * 9) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 165.

   - We need to find combinations where the total cost exceeds 400 cents.

5. **Consider the possible combinations of candy bars:**
   - **Case 1:** All three candy bars are $2 each.
     - Total cost = 3 * 200 = 600 cents. This is more than 400 cents.

   - **Case 3:** Two candy bars are $2 each, and one candy bar is 50 cents.
     - Total cost = 2 * 200 + 1 * 50 = 450 cents. This is more than 400 cents.
     - Number of ways = C(4, 2) * C(3, 1) = 6 * 3 = 18.

   - **Case 4:** One candy bar is $2, and two candy bars are $1 each.
     - Total cost = 1 * 200 + 2 * 100 = 400 cents. This is not more than 400 cents, so we do not count this case.

   - **Case 5:** One candy bar is $2, one candy bar is $1, and one candy bar is 50 cents.

E)460",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members (4 men + 4 women) without any restrictions. This is a combination problem, where we choose 4 people out of 8:

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70

This gives us 70 possible groups of 4 presenters.

Next, we need to subtract the cases where the group is composed entirely of men or entirely of women:

1. **All men**: The number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

2. **All women**: The number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 is:

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1

First, let's find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3. \]

The numbers that are not relatively prime to 1000 are those that share at least one prime factor with 1000, which are 2 and 5. Therefore, we need to count the numbers in the set \( S \) that are not divisible by either 2 or 5.

To find the number of integers in \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000, we can use Euler's Totient Function, \( \phi(n) \), which counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right), \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right). \]

Calculating this gives:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 400. \]

So, there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. The total number of outcomes is the size of the set \( S \), which is 1000.

Thus, the probability is:

First, let's understand the formula for compound interest when compounded semi-annually. The formula for the future value \( A \) of an investment is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8% annual interest rate)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

We need to find \( P \), the original principal amount.

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2 \]

\[ 54,080 = P (1.04)^2 \]

Calculate \( (1.04)^2 \):

\[ (1.04)^2 = 1.0816 \]

Now, substitute back into the equation:

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

To find \( P \), divide both sides by 1.0816:

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

Calculate the division:

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be Joe's current age.

- Let \( F \) be Joe's father's current age.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 100:
   \[
   J + S + F = 100
   \]

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This implies that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age:
   \[
   F - J = 2S - S = S
   \]
   So, \( F - J = S \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This implies that the difference in age between Joe's father and Joe's sister when she was as old as her father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's father and Joe when Joe is as old as his father:
   \[
   F - S = 2(F - (F - S))

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[

   So, \( F = 3S \).

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( J + S + F = 100 \)
2. \( F - J = S \)
3. \( F = 3S \)

Substitute equation 3 into equation 1:
\[
J + S + 3S = 100

\[
J + 4S = 100

Substitute equation 2 into the above:
\[
F - S = J

\[
3S - S = J

\[
J = 2S

\[
6S = 100

\[
S = \frac{100}{6} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67

E)5000/y",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the variables given in the problem statement and how they relate to each other in terms of percentages.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**
   - We are given that \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \).
   - This can be mathematically expressed as:
     \[
     x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:

A)26.2%
B)32.8%
C)43.7%
D)59.0%
E)65.6%",E,"To solve this problem, we need to use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is used to find the probability of having exactly \( k \) successes in \( n \) independent Bernoulli trials, each with a success probability of \( p \). The formula is:

\[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials,
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials,
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial,
- \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

In this problem:
- \( n = 5 \) (since we are choosing 5 registered voters),
- \( k = 4 \) (we want exactly 4 of them to have voted),
- \( p = 0.9 \) (the probability that a registered voter voted in the last election).

First, calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):

\[
\binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4! \cdot (5-4)!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{4! \times 1!} = 5

Next, calculate \( p^k \) and \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):

\[
p^k = 0.9^4 = 0.6561

\[
(1-p)^{n-k} = (1-0.9)^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1

Now, substitute these values into the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} \times 0.9^4 \times 0.1^1 = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1

Calculate the result:

\[

A)58
B)62
C)66
D)70
E)74",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of Alice's rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required for three sides.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Alice's yard is rectangular.
   - One side of the yard, which is 10 meters long, will remain unfenced.
   - The area of the yard is 240 square meters.
   - We need to find the total length of fencing required for the other three sides.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side, \( L \), is 10 meters: \( L = 10 \).
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = L \times W \).
   - Substitute the known values into the area formula: \( 10 \times W = 240 \).

3. **Solve for the Width:**
   - Solve the equation \( 10 \times W = 240 \) to find \( W \).
   - Divide both sides by 10: \( W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \).

4. **Calculate the Fencing Required:**
   - The yard is rectangular, and we need to fence three sides: two widths and one length.
   - The total length of fencing required is: \( 2W + L \).
   - Substitute the known values: \( 2(24) + 10 \).

E)1,900",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different 3-letter codes can be formed under the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the positions and their constraints:**
   - The code is a 3-letter sequence: _ _ _
   - The middle letter must be a vowel.
   - The first and third letters must be consonants and must be different from each other.

2. **Determine the number of choices for each position:**
   - **Middle position (vowel):** There are 5 vowels available. So, there are 5 choices for the middle position.
   - **First position (consonant):** There are 20 consonants available. So, there are 20 choices for the first position.
   - **Third position (consonant):** The third letter must be a consonant different from the first letter. Since one consonant is already used in the first position, there are 19 remaining consonants to choose from for the third position.

3. **Calculate the total number of codes:**
   - For each choice of the middle vowel (5 options), we can choose any of the 20 consonants for the first position.
   - For each of these combinations, we can choose any of the remaining 19 consonants for the third position.
   - Therefore, the total number of different codes is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each position:

   n^3 - n = 2184
   \]

4. **Estimate \( n \)**: We need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 - n = 2184 \). We can estimate \( n \) by considering the cube root of 2184, since \( n^3 \) should be close to 2184.

   - Calculate the approximate cube root of 2184:
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{2184} \approx 13

First, let's calculate the distance from home to work. We know that the worker drives at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour and it takes 9 minutes to reach work. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange this to find the distance:

1. Convert the driving time from minutes to hours because the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is equal to 9/60 hours, which simplifies to 0.15 hours.

2. Use the formula for distance: 
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \, \text{km/h} \times 0.15 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{kilometers}

\[ \text{Rate of P} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jar per minute} \]

Next, let's determine the rate at which Q eats the candies. We know that Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. Therefore, Q's rate of eating is:

\[ \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{0.5 \text{ jar}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jar per minute} \]

Now, we combine the rates of P and Q to find their combined rate of eating the candies:

This combined rate means that together, P and Q can eat \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the jar in one minute. To find out how long it will take them to finish the entire jar, we need to determine how many minutes it takes to eat 1 whole jar at this rate:

\[ \text{Time to finish 1 jar} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ jar per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]
