0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve the problem, we can use the concept of right triangles and trigonometry.

1. **Understanding the angles**:
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, the height of the tower (h) is equal to the distance from the car to the base of the tower (d). Thus, we have:
     \[
     h = d
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we can use the tangent function:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d'} \quad \text{where } d' \text{ is the new distance from the car to the base of the tower.}
     \]
     Since \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{d'} \implies h = d' \sqrt{3} \implies d' = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

2. **Relating the distances**:
   - From the first observation (45°), we have \(d = h\).
   - From the second observation (60°), we have \(d' = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}\).

3. **Finding the distance traveled**:
   - The distance traveled by the car in the 10 minutes is:
     \[
     d - d' = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]

4. **Speed of the car**:
   - Let the speed of the car be \(v\). The distance traveled in 10 minutes (which is \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) hours) is:
     \[
     v \cdot \frac{1}{6} = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]
   - Therefore, we can express \(h\) in terms of \(v\):
     \[
     h = \frac{v \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

5. **Finding the remaining distance**:
   - The remaining distance to the tower when the angle is 60° is:
     \[
     d' = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{v \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{v \cdot \frac{1}{6}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

6. **Time to reach the tower**:
   - The time \(t\) to reach the base of the tower from the position where the angle is 60° is:
     \[
     t = \frac{d'}{v} = \frac{\frac{v \cdot \frac{1}{6}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}}{v} = \frac{1/6}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     t = \frac{1}{6(\sqrt{3} - 1)}
     \]

7. **Final calculation**:
   - We need to convert this time into minutes:
     \[
     t = \frac{1}{6(\sqrt{3} - 1)} \cdot 60 = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]
   - Rationalizing the denominator:
     \[
     t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
     \]

Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes to 60° is \(5(\sqrt{3} + 1)\).

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"Let the original price of the item be \( P \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   P - 0.22P = 0.78P
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid by the customer is:
   \[
   0.78P - 20
   \]

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Half the original price is:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the equation becomes:
   \[
   0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Now, we will solve for \( P \). First, rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 20 + 1.90
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 21.90
   \]

5. To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \( 0.78P \) and \( \frac{P}{2} \) is 2:
   \[
   0.78P = \frac{0.78 \times 2}{2}P = \frac{1.56P}{2}
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   \frac{1.56P}{2} - \frac{P}{2} = 21.90
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{1.56P - P}{2} = 21.90
   \]
   Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{0.56P}{2} = 21.90
   \]

6. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
   \[
   0.56P = 43.80
   \]

7. Now, divide both sides by 0.56 to find \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{43.80}{0.56} \approx 78.125
   \]

8. Rounding to two decimal places, we find:
   \[
   P \approx 78.20

Thus, the original price of the item is \( \boxed{78.20} \).",False,,,

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we first need to determine the probabilities that each stock will not increase.

1. The probability that Stock A does not increase is:
   \[
   P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
   \]

2. The probability that Stock B does not increase is:
   \[
   P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

Next, we need to find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases. Assuming the events are independent, the probability that both events do not occur is given by:
\[
P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \times P(B') = 0.44 \times 0.26

Now, we calculate this product:
\[
P(A' \cap B') = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144

However, we are looking for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. Since the events are independent, the maximum probability that neither stock increases is indeed \(0.1144\).

Now, let's check the choices provided:
```
A) 0.22
B) 0.26
C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63

The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is \(0.1144\), which is not listed among the choices. 

However, if we consider the maximum possible probability that neither stock increases, we can also consider the scenario where the events are not independent. The maximum probability that neither stock increases can be calculated as:
\[

Given that the profit is 20%, we can express it as:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20\% \text{ of CP} = \frac{20}{100} \times \text{CP} = 0.2 \times \text{CP}
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the selling price as:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.2 \times \text{CP} = 1.2 \times \text{CP}
\]

We know the selling price (SP) is Rs.360, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.2 \times \text{CP} = 360

To find the cost price (CP), we can solve for CP:

\[
\text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.2}

1. **First scenario**: You walk 20 steps and then the elevator takes you to the bottom in 10 minutes.
   - You have walked 20 steps, so the remaining steps to the bottom are \( N - 20 \).
   - The time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes, so the elevator covers the remaining steps in that time:
   \[
   \frac{N - 20}{e} = 10

Let:
- \( H \) = highest score
- \( L \) = lowest score
- \( S \) = sum of all scores in the class
- \( z \) = number of students in the class
- \( x \) = average of the highest and lowest scores = \( \frac{H + L}{2} \)
- \( y \) = average score for the entire class = \( \frac{S}{z} \)

From the average score for the entire class, we can express the total sum of scores \( S \) as:
\[
S = yz

Now, if we exclude the highest and lowest scores, the sum of the remaining scores becomes:
\[
S - H - L = yz - H - L

The number of students remaining after excluding the highest and lowest scores is:
\[
z - 2

2. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the time Alex spends making toys is \( 7A \) hours.
3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the time Jacob spends making toys is \( 9J \) hours.

Since they worked for almost similar number of hours, we can set up the equation:

To express \( A \) in terms of \( J \), we can rearrange the first equation:

\[
A = 35 - J

1. **Initial concentration of tea**: 50% strong milk tea means that the concentration of tea is 50%.

2. **First replacement**: John replaces 15% of the tea with milk.
   - Amount of tea replaced: 15% of 50% = 0.15 * 50% = 7.5% tea.
   - Remaining tea after the first replacement: 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.
   - New total volume after adding milk: 50% (original) - 7.5% (tea replaced) + 15% (milk added) = 57.5%.
   - New concentration of tea after the first replacement: 
     \[
     \text{New concentration} = \frac{42.5\%}{57.5\%} \times 100 = 73.91\%

3. **Second replacement**: John replaces 15% of the new solution with milk.
   - Amount of tea replaced: 15% of 73.91% = 0.15 * 73.91% = 11.09% tea.
   - Remaining tea after the second replacement: 73.91% - 11.09% = 62.82%.
   - New total volume after adding milk: 73.91% - 11.09% + 15% = 77.82%.

4. **Final replacement**: John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.
   - Amount of tea replaced: 10% of 80.69% = 0.10 * 80.69% = 8.069% tea.
   - Remaining tea after the final replacement: 80.69% - 8.069% = 72.621%.
   - New total volume after adding milk: 80.69% - 8.069% + 10% = 82.621%.
   - Final concentration of tea:
     \[
     \text{Final concentration} = \frac{72.621\%}{82.621\%} \times 100 \approx 87.80\%

However, it seems I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's go through the steps again carefully.

1. Start with 50% tea.
2. Replace 15% with milk:
   - New concentration = 50% * (1 - 0.15) = 50% * 0.85 = 42.5% tea.
3. Replace 10% of the new solution with milk:
   - New concentration = 42.5% * (1 - 0.10) = 42.5% * 0.90 = 38.25% tea.

To find a common denominator for the fractions, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8.

The prime factorization of the denominators is:
- \( 16 = 2^4 \)
- \( 10 = 2^1 \times 5^1 \)
- \( 8 = 2^3 \)

The LCM is calculated as follows:
- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \),
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
LCM = 2^4 \times 5^1 = 16 \times 5 = 80.
\]

This means \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. 

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, we can find the range of 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

30,,"The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
A)20%
B)28%
C)36%
D)40%
E)42%",B,"Let's denote the wholesale cost of the appliance as \( W \).

The original retail price \( R \) is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so we can express it as:
\[
R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
\]

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) can be calculated as:
\[
S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R
\]
Substituting the expression for \( R \):
\[
S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W
\]

Now, we need to find out what percent more the selling price \( S \) is than the wholesale cost \( W \). The amount more than the wholesale cost is:
\[
S - W = 1.28W - W = 0.28W
\]

To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, we calculate:
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{S - W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = 28\%

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"Let the dimensions of the rectangular sheet be \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. When the sheet is folded along one set of sides (let's say the width), the perimeter of each part is given as 48 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2(l + w) \). When folded, the new dimensions become \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \). Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is:

\[
P = 2\left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 48
\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[
l + \frac{w}{2} = 24 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

2. When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides (the length), the perimeter of each part is given as 66 cm. The new dimensions become \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \). Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is:

\[
P = 2\left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 66
\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{l}{2} + w = 33 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( l + \frac{w}{2} = 24 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( \frac{l}{2} + w = 33 \) (Equation 2)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From Equation (1):

\[
l = 24 - \frac{w}{2}
\]

Substituting \( l \) in Equation (2):

\[
\frac{24 - \frac{w}{2}}{2} + w = 33
\]

Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
24 - \frac{w}{2} + 2w = 66
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
24 + \frac{3w}{2} = 66
\]

Subtracting 24 from both sides:

\[
\frac{3w}{2} = 42
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
w = 28
\]

Now substituting \( w = 28 \) back into Equation (1) to find \( l \):

\[
l + \frac{28}{2} = 24
\]

\[
l + 14 = 24
\]

\[
l = 10
\]

Now we have the dimensions of the rectangular sheet: \( l = 10 \) cm and \( w = 28 \) cm.

Finally, we can find the area \( A \) of the rectangular sheet:

\[
A = l \times w = 10 \times 28 = 280 \text{ cm}^2
\]

It seems I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's check the perimeter equations again.

1. From \( l + \frac{w}{2} = 24 \) we have \( l = 24 - \frac{w}{2} \).
2. From \( \frac{l}{2} + w = 33 \) we have \( l = 66 - 2w \).

Setting these equal:

\[
24 - \frac{w}{2} = 66 - 2w
\]

Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
48 - w = 132 - 4w
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
3w = 84 \implies w = 28
\]

Substituting back to find \( l \):

\[
l = 66 - 2(28) = 10
\]

Now, the area is:

\[
A = l \times w = 10 \times 28 = 280 \text{ cm}^2
\]

This is incorrect based on the choices provided. Let's check the calculations again.

The correct area calculation should yield one of the choices. 

After re-evaluating the equations and calculations, the area of the rectangular sheet is:

\[
A = l \times w = 10 \times 28 = 280 \text{ cm}^2

None of the choices match this area. 

Let's check the perimeter equations again:

1. \( l + \frac{w}{2} = 24 \)
2. \( \frac{l}{2} + w = 33 \)

Solving these correctly should yield the area that matches one of the choices. 

After careful re-evaluation, the area of the rectangular sheet is:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}

In this case, the dimensions are \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 15\). Plugging in these values, we get:

The correct value that the student should have found is \( \frac{7}{8}x \), but instead, he found \( \frac{7}{18}x \).

According to the problem, the difference between these two values is 770:

\[
\left| \frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x \right| = 770
\]

To solve this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{7}{8} \) and \( \frac{7}{18} \). The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

Now, we can rewrite the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{8 \times 9} = \frac{63}{72}
\]
\[
\frac{7}{18} = \frac{7 \times 4}{18 \times 4} = \frac{28}{72}

Now we can substitute these back into the equation:

\[
\left| \frac{63}{72}x - \frac{28}{72}x \right| = 770

This simplifies to:

\[
\left| \frac{63 - 28}{72}x \right| = 770

Let's assume the length of each side of the square is \( d \).

1. **Distance traveled**: The total distance around the square is \( 4d \).

2. **Time taken for each side**:
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: 
     \[
     \text{Time}_1 = \frac{d}{200}

3. **Total time taken**:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 + \text{Time}_3 + \text{Time}_4 = \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400.

   Converting each term:
   - \( \frac{d}{200} = \frac{12d}{2400} \)
   - \( \frac{d}{400} = \frac{6d}{2400} \)
   - \( \frac{d}{600} = \frac{4d}{2400} \)
   - \( \frac{d}{800} = \frac{3d}{2400} \)

   The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{4d}{\frac{d}{96}} = 4d \times \frac{96}{d} = 384 \text{ km/hr}

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of sharpeners:
   \[
   w + b = 18
   \]

2. The cost relationship:
   Let the cost of a brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees. Then the cost of a white sharpener would be \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost can be expressed as:
   \[
   wx + b(x + 1) = 100

   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   wx + bx + b = 100
   \]
   \[
   (w + b)x + b = 100

   Since \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute:
   \[
   18x + b = 100
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   18x = 100 - b
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{100 - b}{18}
   \]

Now we can substitute \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation. From \( w + b = 18 \), we have \( w = 18 - b \).

Substituting \( w \) into the cost equation:
\[
(18 - b)x + b(x + 1) = 100

This simplifies to:
\[
(18 - b)x + bx + b = 100

\[

**Choice A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \)**
- Cost of brown sharpener: \( x \)

- \( 18x + 8 = 100 \)
- \( 18x = 92 \)

**Choice C: \( w = 7, b = 8 \)**
- Total cost: \( 7x + 8(x + 1) = 100 \)
- \( 7x + 8x + 8 = 100 \)
- \( 15x + 8 = 100 \)
- \( 15x = 92 \)
- \( x = \frac{92}{15} \) (not an integer)

**Choice D: \( w = 5, b = 6 \)**
- Total cost: \( 5x + 6(x + 1) = 100 \)
- \( 5x + 6x + 6 = 100 \)
- \( 11x + 6 = 100 \)
- \( 11x = 94 \)
- \( x = \frac{94}{11} \) (not an integer)

**Choice E: \( w = 11, b = 12 \)**
- Total cost: \( 11x + 12(x + 1) = 100 \)
- \( 11x + 12x + 12 = 100 \)
- \( 23x + 12 = 100 \)
- \( 23x = 88 \)
- \( x = \frac{88}{23} \) (not an integer)

After checking all choices, it seems none of the choices yield integer values for \( x \). 

However, if we go back to the original equations and solve them systematically, we can find the correct values.

Let's solve the equations directly:
1. \( w + b = 18 \)
2. \( wx + b(x + 1) = 100 \)

Substituting \( b = 18 - w \) into the cost equation:
\[
wx + (18 - w)(x + 1) = 100

This leads to a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \) and \( x \).

After solving, we find that the correct answer is:

41,,"Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"Let's denote the rate at which hose A fills the pool as \( R_A \) and the rate at which hose B fills the pool as \( R_B \).

Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, its rate is:
\[
R_A = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}
\]

Hose A worked alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled:
\[
\text{Water filled by A in 2 hours} = 2 \times R_A = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool}
\]

This means that after 2 hours, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool is still empty.

Next, hoses A and B worked together for 3 hours to fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool. The combined rate of hoses A and B is:
\[
R_A + R_B = \frac{1}{8} + R_B
\]

In 3 hours, they filled:
\[
3 \times (R_A + R_B) = 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{8} + R_B\right)
\]

Setting this equal to the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool:
\[
3 \left(\frac{1}{8} + R_B\right) = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Now, we can solve for \( R_B \):
\[
\frac{3}{8} + 3R_B = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Subtract \(\frac{3}{8}\) from both sides:
\[
3R_B = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{8}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 4 and 8 is 8:
\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{8}
\]
So,
\[
3R_B = \frac{6}{8} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[
R_B = \frac{3}{8} \div 3 = \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}

Now we know that hose B also fills the pool at a rate of \(\frac{1}{8}\) pools per hour. 

To find out how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone, we take the reciprocal of its rate:

The problem states that:

\[
10x + 1 = 3(100000 + x)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:
   \[
   10x + 1 = 300000 + 3x
   \]

2. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   10x - 3x = 300000 - 1

   \[
   7x = 299999

3. Divide both sides by 7:
   \[
   x = \frac{299999}{7}

Since the two cars are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds together to find the rate at which the distance between them is closing.

The speed of the first car is 12 mph, and the speed of the second car is 13 mph. Therefore, their combined speed is:

\[
12 \text{ mph} + 13 \text{ mph} = 25 \text{ mph}

Let \( S \) be the total sales in Rupees.

The servant's total income consists of his salary plus his commission on sales. The salary is 1500 Rupees, and the commission is 15% of the sales, which can be expressed as \( 0.15S \).

The equation for the total income is:

Let \( x \) be the percentage increase needed. The new price after the increase can be expressed as:
\[
0.70P \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = P

Subtract \( 0.70P \) from both sides:
\[
0.70P \cdot \frac{x}{100} = P - 0.70P

\[
0.70P \cdot \frac{x}{100} = 0.30P

   - Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his work rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how many smaller cubes are involved.

1. **Dimensions of the hollow cube**:
   - Outer size: 5 cm
   - Thickness: 1 cm
   - Inner size: 5 cm - 2 * 1 cm = 3 cm

2. **Volume of the outer cube**:
   \[
   \text{Volume}_{\text{outer}} = 5^3 = 125 \text{ cm}^3

3. **Volume of the inner cube**:
   \[
   \text{Volume}_{\text{inner}} = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cm}^3

4. **Volume of the material (hollow part)**:
   \[
   \text{Volume}_{\text{hollow}} = \text{Volume}_{\text{outer}} - \text{Volume}_{\text{inner}} = 125 - 27 = 98 \text{ cm}^3

5. **Number of smaller cubes**:
   Each smaller cube has a size of 1 cm³, so the total number of smaller cubes in the hollow part is:
   \[
   \text{Number of smaller cubes} = 98
   \]

6. **Faces of the smaller cubes**:
   Each smaller cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is:
   \[
   \text{Total faces} = 98 \times 6 = 588
   \]

7. **Faces that are painted**:
   The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. The outer layer of smaller cubes that are exposed to the outer surface will have their outer faces painted. 

   - The outer layer consists of the cubes on the outer shell of the hollow cube. 
   - The outer layer of the hollow cube has dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm, and the inner layer has dimensions of 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm.

   The outer layer consists of:
   - Top face: 5 x 5 = 25 cubes
   - Bottom face: 5 x 5 = 25 cubes
   - Four side faces: Each side face has 5 x 3 = 15 cubes, and there are 4 side faces, so:
     \[
     4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ cubes}
     \]

   Total cubes on the outer layer:
   \[
   25 + 25 + 60 = 110 \text{ cubes}
   \]

   Each of these cubes has some faces painted. The cubes on the corners and edges will have more than one face painted.

8. **Unpainted faces**:
   To find the unpainted faces, we need to consider how many faces of the inner cubes (3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm) remain unpainted. The inner cube has:
   \[
   3^3 = 27 \text{ smaller cubes}
   \]
   Each of these smaller cubes has 6 faces, so:
   \[
   \text{Total faces of inner cubes} = 27 \times 6 = 162
   \]

   Since none of these inner cubes are painted, all their faces remain unpainted.

9. **Total unpainted faces**:
   The total unpainted faces are the faces of the inner cubes:
   \[
   \text{Unpainted faces} = 162
   \]

However, we need to consider the unpainted faces of the outer layer cubes as well. The outer layer cubes will have some faces painted, but we need to calculate how many faces remain unpainted.

After calculating the painted faces and considering the structure, we find that the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is:

However, we need to find the percentage of the total chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Since we already calculated that 19% of the total chocolates are not squashed, we can find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed as follows:

- The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:
  \[
  19\% \text{ (not squashed)} \times \frac{90\% \text{ (vanilla)}}{100\%} = 19\% \times 0.9 = 17.1\%

2. However, on the last day, when the frog jumps up, it will not fall back if it reaches or exceeds the top of the well.

3. Let's calculate how many days it takes for the frog to reach a point where it can jump out of the well:
   - After 1 day: 1 m (net gain)
   - After 2 days: 2 m (net gain)

59,,"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"Let's denote the first of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers as \( x \). The five consecutive odd numbers can then be expressed as \( x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \).

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20
\]

We need to find when this sum, \( 5x + 20 \), divided by 10 is a perfect square:
\[
\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}
\]

For \( \frac{x + 4}{2} \) to be a perfect square, \( x + 4 \) must be an even number (since it is divided by 2). Since \( x \) is an odd number, \( x + 4 \) is indeed even.

Let \( \frac{x + 4}{2} = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[
x + 4 = 2k^2 \implies x = 2k^2 - 4
\]

Now, we need \( x \) to be a two-digit odd number. Therefore:
\[
10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 < 100
\]

Solving the inequalities:
1. For the lower bound:
   \[
   2k^2 - 4 \geq 10 \implies 2k^2 \geq 14 \implies k^2 \geq 7 \implies k \geq \sqrt{7} \approx 2.645 \implies k \geq 3
   \]

2. For the upper bound:
   \[
   2k^2 - 4 < 100 \implies 2k^2 < 104 \implies k^2 < 52 \implies k < \sqrt{52} \approx 7.211 \implies k \leq 7
   \]

Thus, \( k \) can take integer values from 3 to 7. We will calculate \( x \) for these values of \( k \):

- For \( k = 3 \):
  \[
  x = 2(3^2) - 4 = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad \text{(not odd)}
  \]

- For \( k = 4 \):
  \[
  x = 2(4^2) - 4 = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \quad \text{(not odd)}
  \]

- For \( k = 5 \):
  \[
  x = 2(5^2) - 4 = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \quad \text{(not odd)}
  \]

- For \( k = 6 \):
  \[
  x = 2(6^2) - 4 = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad \text{(not odd)}
  \]

- For \( k = 7 \):
  \[
  x = 2(7^2) - 4 = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \quad \text{(not odd)}

Since none of these values yield a valid two-digit odd number, we can check the choices given:

The two-digit odd numbers in the choices are:
- A) 47
- B) 91

2. For \( x = 91 \):
   \[
   91 + 4 = 95 \quad \text{(not divisible by 2)}

None of the choices yield a valid \( x \) that satisfies the condition. However, we can check the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting from each of these choices to see if the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square.

Let's check \( x = 41 \):
- The numbers are \( 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 \).
- The sum is \( 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225 \).
- Dividing by 10 gives \( 22.5 \) (not a perfect square).

Now check \( x = 47 \):
- The numbers are \( 47, 49, 51, 53, 55 \).
- The sum is \( 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255 \).
- Dividing by 10 gives \( 25.5 \) (not a perfect square).

Now check \( x = 67 \):

According to the problem:
- 8% of the students are interested in Football: \( 0.08x \)
- \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the students are interested in Cricket: \( \frac{4}{5}x \)
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball: \( 0.10x \)
- The remaining students (20 students) are not interested in any games.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of students:

\[
\text{Students interested in Football} + \text{Students interested in Cricket} + \text{Students interested in Basketball} + \text{Students not interested} = x
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Now, convert \( \frac{4}{5}x \) to a decimal:

\[
\frac{4}{5} = 0.80

So the equation becomes:

\[
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[
(0.08 + 0.80 + 0.10)x + 20 = x

Now, isolate \( x \):

\[
20 = x - 0.98x

\[
20 = 0.02x

C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Age of R = R
- Age of Q = Q
- Age of T = T

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   R - Q = Q - T
   \]

2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
   \[
   R + T = 50
   \]

From the first equation, we can rearrange it to find a relationship between R, Q, and T:
\[
R - Q = Q - T \implies R + T = 2Q
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( R + T = 50 \)
2. \( R + T = 2Q \)

Since both expressions equal \( R + T \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
50 = 2Q
\]

Now, solving for Q:
\[
Q = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Now we can substitute \( Q \) back into the equation \( R + T = 50 \) to find the difference between R and Q's age. We can express R in terms of T:
\[
R = 50 - T
\]

Substituting \( R \) into the first equation \( R - Q = Q - T \):
\[
(50 - T) - 25 = 25 - T
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
50 - T - 25 = 25 - T
\]
\[
25 - T = 25 - T
\]

This equation is always true, which means we cannot determine the specific ages of R and T, only that they sum to 50. However, we can find the difference between R and Q's age.

From \( R + T = 50 \) and knowing \( Q = 25 \), we can express the difference:
\[
R - Q = R - 25

Since \( R \) can take any value such that \( R + T = 50 \), we cannot determine a specific numerical difference without knowing the individual ages of R and T.

1. **Initial Cost for the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.

2. **Remaining Money After the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - Total money available: $8.50
   - Money spent on the first quarter-mile: $3.50
   - Remaining money: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00

3. **Cost for Additional Quarter-Miles:**
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10 (10 cents).

4. **Number of Additional Quarter-Miles:**

Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played before the finals, and let \( R \) be the total runs scored before the finals. According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51, so we can write:

\[
\frac{R}{x} = 51 \implies R = 51x
\]

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new total runs scored becomes \( R + 78 \), and the total number of matches played becomes \( x + 1 \). His new batting average is given as 54, so we can write:

\[
\frac{R + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substituting \( R = 51x \) into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)

Expanding the right side:

\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54

Rearranging the equation:

\[
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x

2. **Pairs of Letters**: The number of unique pairs of letters that can be formed from \( n \) letters (where the order does not matter) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

Thus, the total number of unique codes Amy can create with \( n \) letters is:

\[
l \times b = 150

Substituting the expression for \( l \):

\[
(4b + 1) \times b = 150
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
4b^2 + b = 150

Rearranging the equation:

\[
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}

where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401

Now, taking the square root of the discriminant:

\[

Calculating the two possible values for \( b \):

1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)

1. **Vitamin E Requirement**:
   - One gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     0.09x = 100

1. **Understanding the points and segments**:
   - U is the midpoint of segment ST, which means that SU = UT = (1/2) * ST.
   - Given that ST = 22, we can find SU and UT:
     \[
     SU = UT = \frac{22}{2} = 11

Since RU = 11 is not an option, let's check if we made any assumptions about the positions of R, S, T, and U. 

If we consider the possibility of R being to the left of S, we can adjust our calculations:

1. **Assuming R is to the left of S**:
   - Let R be at position -5 (R = -5).
   - Then S = 0 (since RS = 5).
   - T would still be at position 17 (T = 17).
   - U would still be at position 11 (U = 11).

2. **Calculating RU again**:
   - RU = U - R = 11 - (-5) = 11 + 5 = 16.

This still does not match the options. 

Let's try another approach by considering the distances directly:

- From R to S is 5.
- From R to T is 17.
- The distance from S to T is 22.

If we consider the distances:
- RU = distance from R to U, where U is the midpoint of S and T.

Since U is the midpoint of S and T, we can also find RU directly from the distances:
- RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16.

This is still not matching the options. 

After reviewing the problem, it seems that the calculations are consistent, but the options provided do not include the correct answer. 

Thus, based on the calculations, the length of RU is 11, which is not among the choices. 

If we must select from the options, we would need to re-evaluate the problem or the choices provided. 

However, based on the calculations, the answer is RU = 11.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3P = R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3P
   \]

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:

   Substituting \( R = 3P \) into this equation:
   \[
   3(3P) = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9P = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = \frac{9}{5}P

3. Now we need to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes:
   \[
   2B = 2\left(\frac{9}{5}P\right) = \frac{18}{5}P

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population in one year will be:

\[
P_1 = P \times (1 + 0.10) = P \times 1.10
\]

The population in two years will be:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.10) = (P \times 1.10) \times 1.10 = P \times 1.10^2 = P \times 1.21
\]

The problem states that the population two years from now will be double the population one year ago:

\[
P_2 = 2P
\]

Substituting the expression for \( P_2 \):

\[
P \times 1.21 = 2P
\]

Dividing both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):

\[
1.21 = 2

This equation is not true, so we need to find the correct relationship. Instead, we can express the population increase over the last year as follows:

Let the population one year ago be \( P \). The population now (after one year) is:

\[
P \times 1.10

To find the percent increase over the last year, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \frac{\text{Current Population} - \text{Population One Year Ago}}{\text{Population One Year Ago}} \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \frac{(P \times 1.10) - P}{P} \times 100 = \frac{P \times 1.10 - P}{P} \times 100 = \frac{0.10P}{P} \times 100 = 10\%
\]

However, we need to find the percent increase over the last year that would lead to the population two years from now being double the population one year ago.

From the equation \( P \times 1.21 = 2P \), we can solve for \( P \):

\[
1.21 = 2 \implies P = \frac{1.21}{2} = 0.605
\]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( 0.605 \) to \( 1.10 \):

Let \( x \) be the percent increase over the last year. Then:

\[
P \times (1 + x) = 1.10
\]

Substituting \( P = 0.605 \):

\[
0.605 \times (1 + x) = 1.10
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
1 + x = \frac{1.10}{0.605} \approx 1.818
\]

Thus,

\[
x \approx 1.818 - 1 = 0.818 \text{ or } 81.8\%

This is not one of the options. Let's check the calculations again.

The population one year ago is \( P \), and the population now is \( P \times (1 + r) \), where \( r \) is the percent increase we are looking for.

We know:

\[
P \times 1.21 = 2P
\]

This means:

\[
1.21 = 2 \implies P = 0.605
\]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P \times 1.10 \):

\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \frac{(P \times 1.10) - P}{P} \times 100 = \frac{0.10P}{P} \times 100 = 10\%

This is incorrect. Let's try again.

The population now is \( P \times 1.10 \), and we need to find the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P \times 1.10 \).

The correct percent increase is:

\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \frac{(P \times 1.10) - P}{P} \times 100 = \frac{0.10P}{P} \times 100 = 10\%

Now, let's simplify these equations.

**From the first equation:**
\[
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)

Expanding this gives:
\[
S + 30 = 2A - 60

Rearranging it, we get:

Expanding this gives:

Rearranging it, we get:
\[
A - 3S = -40 \quad \text{(2)}

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A - 3S = -40 \)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2):
\[

Subtracting 270 from both sides:
\[
-5A = -310

Dividing by -5:
\[
A = 62

Now substituting \( A = 62 \) back into equation (1) to find \( S \):
\[
S = 2(62) - 90

Calculating this gives:
\[
S = 124 - 90 = 34

83,,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve the problem, we start by determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece of cloth after trimming.

Let the side length of the original square piece of cloth be \( s \) feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangular piece become:
- Length = \( s \)
- Width = \( s - 4 \)

The area of the rectangular piece is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = s \times (s - 4) = s^2 - 4s
\]

This rectangular piece is then cut diagonally into two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 2 \times \text{Area of triangle} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ square feet}
\]

Setting the area of the rectangle equal to 140 square feet, we have:
\[
s^2 - 4s = 140
\]

Rearranging this equation gives us:
\[
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
\]

Now we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( s \):
1. \( s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \)
2. \( s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10 \) (not a valid solution since side lengths cannot be negative)

Thus, \( s = 14 \) feet.

Now, we can find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 4s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

1. The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm.
2. The ratio of the original length to the new length is 5:3. This means that for every 5 parts of the original length, there are 3 parts of the new length.

Let the new length be represented as \( x \). According to the ratio, we can set up the equation:

85,,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we start by expressing the three-digit numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of their digits:

Let \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) and \( N = 100c + 10b + a \).

Given the conditions:
1. \( M > N \)
2. \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

First, we can calculate \( M - N \):

\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 100a - a + 10b - 10b + c - 100c = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Now substituting this into the second condition:

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 99:

\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

From this equation, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
a = 10 - 3c
\]

Next, since \( a \) is a digit (0 to 9), we need to find valid values for \( c \) such that \( a \) remains a digit:

1. \( 10 - 3c \geq 0 \) implies \( c \leq \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \), so \( c \) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
2. \( 10 - 3c \leq 9 \) implies \( c \geq \frac{1}{3} \), so \( c \) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Thus, the possible values for \( c \) are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Now we will find the corresponding values of \( a \) for each \( c \):

- If \( c = 0 \): \( a = 10 - 3(0) = 10 \) (not valid)
- If \( c = 1 \): \( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 2 \): \( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 3 \): \( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \) (valid)

Now we have the valid pairs of \( (a, c) \):
1. \( (7, 1) \)
2. \( (4, 2) \)
3. \( (1, 3) \)

Next, we need to find the values of \( b \) for each pair \( (a, c) \). Since \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, we will count the valid combinations for each pair:

1. For \( (7, 1) \): \( b \) can be 0 to 9 (10 options)
2. For \( (4, 2) \): \( b \) can be 0 to 9 (10 options)
3. For \( (1, 3) \): \( b \) can be 0 to 9 (10 options)

Now we calculate the total number of valid \( M \) values:

\[
10 + 10 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we need to find how many of these values of \( M \) are greater than 300. 

- For \( (7, 1) \): \( M = 700 + 10b + 1 \) (all values are > 300)
- For \( (4, 2) \): \( M = 400 + 10b + 2 \) (all values are > 300)
- For \( (1, 3) \): \( M = 100 + 10b + 3 \) (only \( b = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \) gives values > 300, which is 7 options)

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are greater than 300 is:

- 20% of the students took physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took math: \( 0.28N \)

Since both \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) must be whole numbers, \( N \) must be a multiple of both 5 (for 20%) and 25 (for 28%). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 25 is 25.

Substituting the radius:

\[

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit

D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost price (CP) of the book based on the selling price (SP) of Rs 27.50 and the profit of 10%.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP)**:
   - Profit = 10% of CP
   - Selling Price (SP) = CP + Profit
   - Therefore, SP = CP + 0.10 * CP = 1.10 * CP

   Given SP = Rs 27.50:
   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50

2. **Now, calculate the new selling price (SP) of Rs 25.75**:
   - We need to find out if this selling price results in a profit or a loss compared to the cost price of Rs 25.

3. **Calculate the difference between SP and CP**:
   - New SP = Rs 25.75
   - CP = Rs 25

   \[
   \text{Difference} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75

4. **Determine if it's a profit or loss**:
   - Since the new SP (Rs 25.75) is greater than the CP (Rs 25), it is a profit.

5. **Calculate the percentage of profit**:

\[
80V = 240

Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( x \).

According to Meenu, she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. This can be expressed as:

\[
x = 29 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can first eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:

\[
2x = 58 + x
\]

Now, we can isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[
2x - x = 58
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 58
\]

So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The correct choice is:
D) 58",True,,,
