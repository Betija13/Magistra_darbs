0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote:

- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Using the tangent of the angles, we have:
1. \( \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \) which implies \( x_1 = h \).
2. \( \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. Therefore, the distance covered in 10 minutes is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right). \]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}. \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (i.e., when the distance is 0).

The remaining distance to the base is \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

The time \( t \) to cover this distance is:
\[ t = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}. \]

Simplifying this expression:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h (\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{10\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{h (\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \frac{10h}{h (\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}. \]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}. \]

The denominator simplifies as:
\[ (\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 3 - 1 = 2. \]

Thus, the time \( t \) is:
\[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1). \]

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

A)$61
B)$65

D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20

3. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Start by simplifying and solving for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80

   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.80

   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.80

1. **Find the LCM of 9 and 12:**

   - The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\).

   To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

   - The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is 0.74.

We are looking for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both events do not occur.

The probability that Stock A does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither event occurs, we assume that the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value is the product of the probabilities that each does not increase:

\[
P(\text{neither A nor B}) = (1 - P(A)) \times (1 - P(B)) = 0.44 \times 0.26
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
\]

However, this is not one of the choices provided. The problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This suggests considering the scenario where the events are not independent and could be mutually exclusive, which would maximize the probability that neither occurs.

If the events are mutually exclusive, the probability that neither occurs is:

\[
1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30
\]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, the mutually exclusive scenario is not possible. Therefore, the greatest realistic probability occurs when the events are independent, which we calculated as 0.1144.

Since 0.1144 is not an option, we must consider the possibility of a mistake in the problem setup or options. However, based on the given options, the closest and most reasonable choice is:

\[

This choice assumes a potential error in the problem setup or options, as the calculated value does not match any provided option.",False,,,,,

Given that the profit is 20% of the cost price, we can express the selling price as:

\[

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}

E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initially, all marbles in the bag are white.
   - 20 marbles are pulled out and painted black, then returned to the bag. So, there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. **Second Pull:**
   - Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black.
   - The percentage of black marbles in this sample is \( \frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\% \).

3. **Percentage Representation:**
   - The problem states that this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.
   - Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is also 5%.

4. **Calculate Total Marbles \( Q \):**

1. **Letters**: 
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.

   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 letters is \(26 \times 26 = 676\).

2. **Numbers**:
   - There are 10 digits (0 through 9).
   - Similarly, the problem does not specify that the numbers need to be distinct, so we can use the same number twice.
   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

3. **Total Combinations**:

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the number of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the number of students who took part in the debating session.
- \( N \) as the number of students who attended neither.

We know:
- The total number of students is 200.
- At least 45% attended the prom night: \( P \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \).
- At least 35% took part in the debating session: \( D \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \).

We want to maximize \( N \), the number of students who attended neither. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:

\[
N = 200 - (P + D - \text{both})

To maximize \( N \), we need to minimize \( P + D - \text{both} \). The minimum value of \( P + D \) occurs when \( P = 90 \) and \( D = 70 \), giving:

\[
P + D = 90 + 70 = 160

The minimum value of \( P + D - \text{both} \) is when the overlap (both) is maximized. The maximum overlap is when all students in the smaller group (debating session) are also in the larger group (prom night), i.e., \(\text{both} = 70\).

Thus, the minimum value of \( P + D - \text{both} \) is:

First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces:

\[ 420 \text{ units/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 5040 \text{ units/year} \]

The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost for the year is:

Next, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The profit is the revenue minus the production costs, so:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Production Cost} \]

We want the profit to be at least $626,400, so:

\[ \text{Revenue} - 554,400 \geq 626,400 \]

Solving for the revenue:

\[ \text{Revenue} \geq 626,400 + 554,400 \]

E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

First, let's calculate the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:

- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

To find the combined rate of both machines working together, we add their individual rates:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Therefore, we convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

Thus, the combined rate of the two machines is \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to produce 10 yo-yos at this combined rate. Let \( t \) be the time in minutes. We set up the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10

Let's define:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( n \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. When you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. When you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

**Scenario 1:**
- You walk 20 steps.
- The elevator covers the remaining \( n - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

The elevator's speed equation for this scenario is:
\[ n - 20 = 10v \]

**Scenario 2:**
- You walk 10 steps.
- The elevator covers the remaining \( n - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

The elevator's speed equation for this scenario is:
\[ n - 10 = 20v \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( n - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( n - 10 = 20v \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From equation 1:
\[ n = 10v + 20 \]

From equation 2:
\[ n = 20v + 10 \]

Set the two expressions for \( n \) equal to each other:
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]

Solve for \( v \):
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]
\[ 20 = 10v + 10 \]
\[ 10 = 10v \]
\[ v = 1 \]

First, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year. Since the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month last year, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number sold last year is:

\[ 42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year. The store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for these 10 months, so the total number sold is:

\[ 20 \text{ ovens/month} \times 10 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ ovens} \]

Now, we can find the total number of microwave ovens sold over the entire 22-month period by adding the totals from last year and the first 10 months of this year:

\[ 504 \text{ ovens} + 200 \text{ ovens} = 704 \text{ ovens} \]

Finally, to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period, we divide the total number of ovens sold by the total number of months:

\[ \frac{704 \text{ ovens}}{22 \text{ months}} = 32 \text{ ovens/month} \]

First, let's calculate the profit made on each bag:

1. The selling price of each bag is $100.
2. The profit percentage is 25% of the selling price.
3. Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:

Let \( x \) be the number of toys made by Alex, and \( y \) be the number of toys made by Jacob. We know from the problem:

1. The total number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob is 35:
   \[
   x + y = 35

2. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7x \).

3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9y \).

4. Both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, which means:
   \[

We can solve these equations to find the number of toys made by Jacob (\( y \)).

From the first equation, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[
x = 35 - y

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk. 
   - The amount of tea in the solution is reduced by 15% of 50%.
   - Reduction in tea = 0.15 * 50% = 7.5%

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

1. **Math students**: \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math, so the number of math students is \( \frac{N}{16} \).
2. **Bio students**: \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, so the number of bio students is \( \frac{N}{10} \).
3. **English students**: \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English, so the number of English students is \( \frac{N}{8} \).

Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999.

For \( N \) to be a valid number of students, it must be divisible by 16, 10, and 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers will give us the smallest possible \( N \) that satisfies all conditions.

- The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is calculated as follows:
  - Prime factorization:
    - \( 16 = 2^4 \)
    - \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \)
    - \( 8 = 2^3 \)
  - LCM is the highest power of each prime:
    - \( 2^4 \) (from 16)
    - \( 5^1 \) (from 10)
  - LCM = \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \)

Thus, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Now, we find the range of 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80:

- The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. The smallest multiple of 80 greater than or equal to 1000 is:
  \[
  \lceil \frac{1000}{80} \rceil = \lceil 12.5 \rceil = 13

  So, the smallest \( N = 13 \times 80 = 1040 \).

- The largest 4-digit number is 9999. The largest multiple of 80 less than or equal to 9999 is:
  \[
  \lfloor \frac{9999}{80} \rfloor = \lfloor 124.9875 \rfloor = 124

The map's scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. This means that for every 1/4 inch on the map, the actual distance is 10 miles.

First, we need to find out how many 1/4 inches are there in 20 inches:

\[
\text{Number of } \frac{1}{4} \text{ inches in 20 inches} = \frac{20}{\frac{1}{4}} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

This means there are 80 segments of 1/4 inch in 20 inches.

Since each 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, the actual distance is:

\[
80 \times 10 = 800 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 800 miles.

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the situation described. We have a rectangular sheet with length \( l \) and width \( w \).

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - If we fold along the length, each part will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{l}{2} + w \right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - If we fold along the width, each part will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( l + \frac{w}{2} \right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
l + 2w &= 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
2l + w &= 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

- Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
  \[
  2l + 4w = 96
  \]

- Subtract Equation 2 from this result:
  \[
  (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66
  \]
  \[
  3w = 30
  \]
  \[
  w = 10
  \]

- Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
  \[
  l + 2(10) = 48
  \]
  \[
  l + 20 = 48
  \]
  \[
  l = 28
  \]

Now, we have the dimensions of the sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.

Finally, calculate the area of the sheet:
\[
\text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2
\]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Re-evaluate the folding and perimeter conditions:
- Folding along the length gives \( l + 2w = 48 \).
- Folding along the width gives \( 2l + w = 66 \).

Re-solve the system:
- From \( l + 2w = 48 \), express \( l = 48 - 2w \).
- Substitute into \( 2l + w = 66 \):
  \[
  2(48 - 2w) + w = 66
  \]
  \[
  96 - 4w + w = 66
  \]
  \[
  96 - 3w = 66
  \]
  \[
  3w = 30
  \]
  \[
  w = 10
  \]

- Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into \( l = 48 - 2w \):
  \[
  l = 48 - 2(10) = 48 - 20 = 28
  \]

Re-calculate the area:
\[
\text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2

The space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

In this problem, the dimensions of the rectangular solid are \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\). Therefore, the space diagonal is:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225

Adding these values:

\[

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Combine the terms with \( b \):

\[ b(x + y) + x = 100 \]

Using Equation 1 (\( x + y = 18 \)), substitute into the equation:

\[ b(18) + x = 100 \]

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[ (100 - 18b) + y = 18 \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need:

1. \( 100 - 18b \geq 0 \)
2. \( 18b - 82 \geq 0 \)

From the first inequality:

\[ 100 \geq 18b \]
\[ b \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56 \]

From the second inequality:

\[ 18b \geq 82 \]
\[ b \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56 \]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the possible value for \( b \) is 5.

Substitute \( b = 5 \) into Equation 2:

\[ x = 100 - 18 \times 5 \]
\[ x = 100 - 90 \]

Substitute \( b = 5 \) into the equation for \( y \):

The two cars are moving towards each other, so we can add their speeds to find the rate at which the distance between them is decreasing. The first car is traveling at 12 mph, and the second car is traveling at 13 mph. Therefore, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is:

\[ 12 \text{ mph} + 13 \text{ mph} = 25 \text{ mph} \]

The total distance between the two cars initially is 50 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, we use the formula:

C)31500
D)50000
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must make to achieve a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees.

The servant's total monthly income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission he earns from sales. The fixed salary is 1500 Rupees, and the commission is 15% of the sales.

Let's denote the sales amount as \( S \).

The commission earned from sales is \( 0.15 \times S \).

The total income is given by:
\[
\text{Total Income} = \text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission} = 1500 + 0.15 \times S
\]

We want this total income to be 6000 Rupees:
\[
1500 + 0.15 \times S = 6000
\]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission term:
\[
0.15 \times S = 6000 - 1500
\]
\[
0.15 \times S = 4500
\]

Now, solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 0.15:
\[
S = \frac{4500}{0.15}

\[
S = 30000

D)5%
E)12%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the loan. The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. 

First, calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months:
\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 12 \times 31.50 = 378
\]

The interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal amount borrowed:
\[
\text{Interest paid} = 378 - 360 = 18
\]

Next, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to find the annual interest rate that would result in Rs.18 interest over the course of a year.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Interest is Rs.18
- Principal is Rs.360
- Time is 1 year

Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} = \frac{18}{360 \times 1} = \frac{18}{360} = 0.05

1. After a 30% reduction, the new price becomes:
   \[
   P_{\text{new}} = P - 0.3P = 0.7P
   \]

2. We need to find the percentage increase required to bring \( 0.7P \) back to \( P \).

3. Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \). Then, the equation to find \( x \) is:
   \[
   0.7P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P

4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   0.7P + 0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = P

5. Subtract \( 0.7P \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = P - 0.7P

6. Simplify the right side:
   \[
   0.7P \times \frac{x}{100} = 0.3P

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**

   Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days. Therefore, his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.

   In 8 days, Mr. Brown will paint:
   \[
   8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ houses}

C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understanding the Structure:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the outer cube is 5x5x5, and the inner hollow part is 3x3x3 (since 5 - 2*1 = 3).

2. **Total Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The outer cube (5x5x5) consists of 5^3 = 125 smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3x3x3) consists of 3^3 = 27 smaller cubes.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98.

3. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the cubes on the surface are affected.
   - The surface of a 5x5x5 cube consists of 6 faces, each with 5x5 = 25 smaller cubes.
   - However, some cubes are shared between faces, so we need to count carefully.

4. **Counting Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - A cube on the face of the outer surface will have 1 face painted.
   - A cube on the edge of the outer surface will have 2 faces painted.
   - A cube on the corner of the outer surface will have 3 faces painted.

5. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**
   - For the outer layer (5x5x5), all cubes on the surface are painted on at least one face.
   - The inner cubes (3x3x3) are not painted at all, as they are not exposed to the outer surface.

6. **Unpainted Faces Calculation:**
   - Total faces of all smaller cubes = 98 cubes * 6 faces = 588 faces.
   - Faces painted = (outer surface cubes) * (painted faces per cube).
   - Since the inner 3x3x3 cubes are not painted, they contribute 27 cubes * 6 faces = 162 unpainted faces.

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - Total unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces.
   - Painted faces = Total faces - Unpainted faces of inner cubes.
   - Unpainted faces = 588 - (painted faces on outer surface).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of unpainted faces is 588 - 90 = 498.

\[ x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \]

The sum of these numbers is:

\[ x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20 \]

We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square} \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2} \]

Let \( \frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer. Then:

\[ x + 4 = 2n^2 \]
\[ x = 2n^2 - 4 \]

Since \( x \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( n \) such that \( x \) is a two-digit odd number.

1. \( x \) must be odd, so \( 2n^2 - 4 \) must be odd. This implies \( 2n^2 \) must be odd, which is not possible since \( 2n^2 \) is always even. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach.

Let's reconsider the condition: \( \frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \) implies \( x + 4 = 2n^2 \), and \( x = 2n^2 - 4 \).

Now, let's check each choice to see if it can be expressed in the form \( 2n^2 - 4 \).

- **Choice A: 47**

  \[ 47 = 2n^2 - 4 \]
  \[ 2n^2 = 51 \]
  \[ n^2 = 25.5 \]

  \( n^2 \) is not an integer, so 47 is not a solution.

- **Choice C: 41**

  \[ 41 = 2n^2 - 4 \]
  \[ 2n^2 = 45 \]
  \[ n^2 = 22.5 \]

  \( n^2 \) is not an integer, so 41 is not a solution.

- **Choice D: 67**

  \[ 67 = 2n^2 - 4 \]
  \[ 2n^2 = 71 \]
  \[ n^2 = 35.5 \]

  \( n^2 \) is not an integer, so 67 is not a solution.

- **Choice E: 44**

  \[ 44 = 2n^2 - 4 \]
  \[ 2n^2 = 48 \]
  \[ n^2 = 24 \]

  \( n^2 \) is not an integer, so 44 is not a solution.

Upon reviewing the calculations, it seems none of the choices directly satisfy the condition. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The sum of the numbers is \( 5x + 20 \), and dividing by 10 gives a perfect square:

\[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = n^2 \]
\[ 5x + 20 = 10n^2 \]
\[ 5x = 10n^2 - 20 \]
\[ x = 2n^2 - 4 \]

Re-evaluating the choices, it seems there was a miscalculation. Let's check the calculations again:

- **Choice D: 67**

  \[ 67 = 2n^2 - 4 \]
  \[ 2n^2 = 71 \]
  \[ n^2 = 35.5 \]

  \( n^2 \) is not an integer, so 67 is not a solution.

Upon further inspection, it seems there was an oversight. Let's try a different approach:

The sum \( 5x + 20 \) divided by 10 should be a perfect square. Let's try to find a valid \( x \) that fits this condition:

- If \( n = 3 \), then \( n^2 = 9 \), and:

  \[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = 9 \]
  \[ 5x + 20 = 90 \]
  \[ 5x = 70 \]
  \[ x = 14 \]

  14 is not a two-digit odd number.

- If \( n = 4 \), then \( n^2 = 16 \), and:

  \[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = 16 \]
  \[ 5x + 20 = 160 \]
  \[ 5x = 140 \]
  \[ x = 28 \]

  28 is not a two-digit odd number.

- If \( n = 5 \), then \( n^2 = 25 \), and:

  \[ \frac{5x + 20}{10} = 25 \]
  \[ 5x + 20 = 250 \]
  \[ 5x = 230 \]
  \[ x = 46 \]

  46 is not a two-digit odd number.

According to the problem:
- 8% of the students are interested in Football, which is \( 0.08x \).
- \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( 0.8x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.10x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus the students not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

\[
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Simplify the equation:

\[
0.98x + 20 = x

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:

\[

\[

E)None of the above",D,"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions equal \( r + t \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we know:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( q = 25 \), we substitute back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \):

\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms that our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ r = 50 - t \]

Substituting \( r = 50 - t \) into \( r - q = q - t \):

\[ (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Simplifying:

\[ 25 - t = 25 - t \]

This equation is always true, but it doesn't help us find a specific value for \( r - q \) without additional information about \( t \).

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined with the given information.

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for batting average and set up an equation based on the information given.

The batting average is calculated as the total number of runs scored divided by the total number of matches played.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total number of runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51
\]
This implies:
\[
y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54. The total number of matches after the finals is \( x + 1 \), and the total number of runs is \( y + 78 \).

The new batting average is given by:
\[
\frac{y + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:
\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( x + 1 \):
\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)
\]

Expand the right side:
\[
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
\]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
\[
78 - 54 = 54x - 51x

\[
24 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:
\[

Let's denote the number of letters as \( n \).

1. **Single Letter Codes**: There are \( n \) possible single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of different pairs of letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

The total number of unique codes (single letters and pairs) is:

E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then calculate its perimeter.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

Substituting the values, we have:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150)}}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth does not make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The dimensions of the rectangle are 6 meters by 25 meters.

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]
\[ P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

Let's denote the number of grams of the health food needed as \( x \).

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - Therefore, \( 9\% \times x \) should be at least 100% to meet the daily requirement.
   - This gives us the inequality: \( 9x \geq 100 \).

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - Therefore, \( 8\% \times x \) should be at least 100% to meet the daily requirement.
   - This gives us the inequality: \( 8x \geq 100 \).

Now, let's solve these inequalities:

- For vitamin E: 
  \[
  9x \geq 100 \implies x \geq \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
  \]

- For vitamin A:
  \[
  8x \geq 100 \implies x \geq \frac{100}{8} = 12.5

- The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

Next, let's determine the total work required in terms of large cakes and small cakes:
- 20 large cakes are needed.
- 700 small cakes are needed.

Now, let's calculate the work each helper can do in 3 hours:
- Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make \(2 \times 3 = 6\) large cakes.
- Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make \(35 \times 3 = 105\) small cakes.

Now, let's calculate the number of helpers needed for each type of cake:

1. **Large Cakes:**
   - Total large cakes needed = 20
   - Large cakes made by one helper in 3 hours = 6
   - Number of helpers needed for large cakes = \(\lceil \frac{20}{6} \rceil = \lceil 3.33 \rceil = 4\)

2. **Small Cakes:**
   - Total small cakes needed = 700
   - Small cakes made by one helper in 3 hours = 105
   - Number of helpers needed for small cakes = \(\lceil \frac{700}{105} \rceil = \lceil 6.67 \rceil = 7\)

Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we need the maximum number of helpers required for either task. Therefore, the total number of helpers required is the maximum of the two calculated values:

- Maximum number of helpers needed = \(\max(4, 7) = 7\)

However, since the problem asks for the number of helpers required to meet both demands simultaneously, we need to ensure that the helpers can switch tasks if needed. Therefore, we should consider the total work in terms of a common unit.

Let's convert the work into a common unit, such as ""cake units,"" where 1 large cake = 17.5 small cakes (since 2 large cakes = 35 small cakes).

- Total cake units needed = \(20 \times 17.5 + 700 = 350 + 700 = 1050\) small cake units.

Now, calculate the number of helpers needed to produce 1050 small cake units in 3 hours:
- Small cake units made by one helper in 3 hours = 105
- Number of helpers needed = \(\lceil \frac{1050}{105} \rceil = \lceil 10 \rceil = 10\)

Therefore, the number of helpers required is 10.

We are given:
- RS = 5
- RT = 17
- ST = 22
- U is the midpoint of ST

Since U is the midpoint of ST, we know that SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

Now, let's consider the positions of the points on the line. We can place point R at position 0 on a number line. Then, point S would be at position 5 because RS = 5.

Next, since ST = 22, point T would be at position 5 + 22 = 27.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, U is halfway between S and T. Therefore, U is at position (5 + 27)/2 = 32/2 = 16.

Finally, we need to find the length of RU. Since R is at position 0 and U is at position 16, the length of RU is simply the distance between these two points, which is 16 - 0 = 16.

1. R is at 0.
2. S is at 5.
3. T is at 27.

The midpoint U of ST (from S = 5 to T = 27) is indeed at 16.

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- \( R \) as the amount of falafel in one roll.
- \( B \) as the amount of falafel in one baguette.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3P
   \]

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = \frac{3R}{5}
   \]

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes:
\[
2B = xP
\]

Substitute \( B = \frac{3R}{5} \) into the equation for two baguettes:
\[
2 \left(\frac{3R}{5}\right) = xP \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{6R}{5} = xP
\]

Substitute \( R = 3P \) into the equation:
\[
\frac{6(3P)}{5} = xP \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{18P}{5} = xP

Divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):

Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \(\frac{18}{5}\) pita breads.

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount. Therefore, the discounted price is:
\[ P_{\text{discounted}} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price \( P \). To find the percentage increase needed from the discounted price back to the original price, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Here, the ""New Price"" is the original price \( P \), and the ""Old Price"" is the discounted price \( 0.80P \).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - 0.80P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.20}{0.80} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.25 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 25\% \]

1. **Width of Pickets:**
   - Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
   - For x pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Space Between Pickets:**
   - There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
   - For x pickets, there are \( x - 1 \) spaces between them.
   - The total space between the pickets is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Total Length in Inches:**

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
- \( 10s \) as the speed of the plane in miles per hour (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts its journey. We need to find the time it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship after the plane starts. During this time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( s \times t \) miles, and the plane travels a distance of \( 10s \times t \) miles.

Since the plane catches up with the ship, the total distance traveled by the ship (180 miles + \( s \times t \)) is equal to the distance traveled by the plane (\( 10s \times t \)).

We can set up the equation:
\[
180 + s \times t = 10s \times t
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
180 = 10s \times t - s \times t
\]
\[
180 = 9s \times t

Solving for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{180}{9s} = \frac{20}{s}

Now, we need to find the total distance from the starting point when they meet. The ship travels for a total time of \( t + \frac{180}{s} \) hours (since it traveled 180 miles before the plane started).

The total distance traveled by the ship is:
\[
\text{Distance} = s \times \left(\frac{180}{s} + \frac{20}{s}\right) = 180 + 20 = 200 \text{ miles}

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM. We need to find the probability that he catches the first train that arrives.

- If the man arrives between 5:02 AM and 5:10 AM, he will catch the harbor line train at 5:02 AM.

Let's calculate the probability:

- The total time interval is 10 minutes (from 5:00 AM to 5:10 AM).
- The time interval where the man catches the main line train is 2 minutes (from 5:00 AM to 5:02 AM).

Therefore, the probability that the man catches the main line train is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Time interval for main line train}}{\text{Total time interval}} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2

Thus, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 0.2.

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times (1 + \text{percent increase}) \]

Since the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, and it increases by 10% each year, we can deduce that the current population must have increased by a certain percentage to reach this point.

Let's calculate the percent increase:
- The population two years from now is \( 1.21P \).
- The population one year ago is \( P \).

The current population must be such that:
\[ P_{\text{current}} \times 1.1 = 1.21P \]

Solving for \( P_{\text{current}} \):
\[ P_{\text{current}} = \frac{1.21P}{1.1} \]

Now, calculate the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P_{\text{current}} \):
\[ \text{Percent increase} = \left(\frac{P_{\text{current}} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute \( P_{\text{current}} = \frac{1.21P}{1.1} \):
\[ \text{Percent increase} = \left(\frac{\frac{1.21P}{1.1} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

Simplify:
\[ \text{Percent increase} = \left(\frac{1.21/1.1 - 1}{1}\right) \times 100\% \]

Calculate:
\[ \frac{1.21}{1.1} \approx 1.1 \]

Thus:
\[ \text{Percent increase} = (1.1 - 1) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

However, this is incorrect because we need to find the increase from one year ago to the current year, not the future year. Let's re-evaluate:

The correct approach is to find the increase from the initial population to the current population, knowing that the future population is double the initial population.

Given:
\[ 1.21P = 2P \]

The current population must be:
\[ P_{\text{current}} = \sqrt{2}P \]

Calculate the percent increase:
\[ \text{Percent increase} = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}P - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent increase} = (\sqrt{2} - 1) \times 100\% \]

\[ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \]

\[ \text{Percent increase} = (1.414 - 1) \times 100\% = 0.414 \times 100\% = 41.4\% \]

The closest choice to 41.4% is 40%.

- Let \( A \) be the amount of money Arjun has.
- Let \( S \) be the amount of money Sajal has.

We are given two conditions:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
   - Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).
   - According to the condition: \( S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \).

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - After giving $10, Sajal will have \( S - 10 \).
   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - According to the condition: \( A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \).

Now, let's solve these equations:

From the first condition:
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]  (Equation 1)

From the second condition:
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]
\[ A = 3S - 40 \]  (Equation 2)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]
\[ 310 = 6A - A \]
\[ 310 = 5A \]
\[ A = 62 \]

Now substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]
\[ S = 124 - 90 \]
\[ S = 34 \]

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles, each with legs \( s \) and \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculate the area of one triangle:**
   - The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For one triangle, the area is \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).

4. **Solve for \( s \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
   \]
   \[
   s \times (s - 4) = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0

5. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for \( s \):**
   - The quadratic formula is \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   \[
   s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}

   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}

   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}

   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     - \( s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \)
     - \( s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10 \) (not possible since side length cannot be negative)

E)12",A,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{30} = \frac{3}{5}

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we need to express the numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of the digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We are also given the conditions:
1. \( M > N \)
2. \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

Let's first express \( M - N \):
\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:
\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Now, solve for \( a \):
\[
a = 10 - 3c
\]

Since \( a \) is a digit (1 to 9 for a three-digit number), and \( c \) is a digit (0 to 9), we need to find valid integer values for \( c \) such that \( a \) is a valid digit.

Check possible values for \( c \):
- If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(0) = 10 \) (not valid, as \( a \) must be a digit from 1 to 9)
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \) (valid)
- If \( c = 4 \), then \( a = 10 - 3(4) = -2 \) (not valid)

Thus, the valid pairs \((a, c)\) are:
- \( (7, 1) \)
- \( (4, 2) \)
- \( (1, 3) \)

For each pair, we need to find the number of values of \( M \) that are greater than 300.

1. For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \):
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 700 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
   - \( M > 300 \) is always true since \( M \geq 701 \)
   - \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values for \( M \).

2. For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \):
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 400 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
   - \( M > 300 \) is always true since \( M \geq 402 \)
   - \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values for \( M \).

3. For \( (a, c) = (1, 3) \):
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 100 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)
   - \( M > 300 \) when \( 103 + 10b > 300 \)
   - Solving \( 10b > 197 \) gives \( b \geq 20 \), but since \( b \) is a digit, \( b \) must be at least 8.
   - Possible values for \( b \) are 8 and 9, giving 2 possible values for \( M \).

Adding up all the possible values of \( M \) that are greater than 300:
- From \( (7, 1) \): 10 values

We are looking for the smallest \( N \) such that:

1. \( N > 501 \)
2. \( 0.20N \) and \( 0.28N \) are integers (since the number of students must be whole numbers).

Let's calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the percentages, which are 5 (from 20%) and 25 (from 28%). The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25 for both \( 0.20N \) and \( 0.28N \) to be integers.

Now, we find the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501:

- The smallest multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525.

Let's check if 525 satisfies the conditions:

- \( 0.20 \times 525 = 105 \) (an integer)

   Let the cost price be \( CP \).

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this with the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75

- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

Now we have determined that the fixed cost \( F \) is Rs.180 and the variable cost per call \( V \) is Rs.3.

For the month where 500 calls are made, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after they start rotating.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times (13 minutes and 7 minutes) to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.

The prime factorization of 13 is \( 13^1 \) (since 13 is a prime number), and the prime factorization of 7 is \( 7^1 \) (since 7 is also a prime number).

The LCM of two numbers is found by taking the highest power of all prime factors present in the numbers. Therefore, the LCM of 13 and 7 is:

\[ \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13^1 \times 7^1 = 91 \]

Thus, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Now, convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:

- 91 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes make 1 hour, and 91 - 60 = 31 minutes).

Therefore, the answer is:

A) 1 hour and 31 minutes",True,,,,,

A)10
B)15
C)18
D)20
E)30",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction.

We are given:
- Total number of books = 45
- Number of hardcover books = 30
- Number of fiction books = 20

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the set of hardcover books
- \( F \) as the set of fiction books
- \( H \cap F \) as the set of books that are both hardcover and fiction

We know:
- \( |H| = 30 \)
- \( |F| = 20 \)
- \( |H \cup F| \leq 45 \) (since the total number of books is 45)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets, we have:
\[
|H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F|
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
|H \cup F| = 30 + 20 - |H \cap F|
\]

Since \( |H \cup F| \leq 45 \), we have:
\[
30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45
\]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[
50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45
\]

\[
50 - 45 \leq |H \cap F|
\]

\[
5 \leq |H \cap F|
\]

This means the minimum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5. However, we are asked for the maximum number.

To find the maximum, consider that the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two categories, which is fiction (20 books). Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is \(\boxed{20}\).",False,,,,,
94,,"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and also on each of the other weekdays, since the number is the same for each weekday).

According to the problem, the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on any other day. Therefore, the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday is \( 2x \).

The cost of newspapers is $1 each from Monday to Saturday, and $4 each on Sunday.

The total cost for the week is $210.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- From Monday to Saturday (6 days), the hotel buys \( x \) newspapers each day at $1 each. So, the cost for these days is:
  \[
  6x \times 1 = 6x
  \]

- On Sunday, the hotel buys \( 2x \) newspapers at $4 each. So, the cost for Sunday is:
  \[
  2x \times 4 = 8x
  \]

The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for these days:
\[
6x + 8x = 14x
\]

We know the total cost is $210, so we set up the equation:
\[
14x = 210
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 14:
\[
x = \frac{210}{14} = 15

A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's assume the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic is \( x \).

The total cost of the picnic is Rs. 96.

If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them contributed \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \) rupees.

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \) to eliminate the fractions:

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x

3. Combine like terms:

\[

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**

   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})

   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} = 88 \, \text{cm}

2. **Determine the side of the square:**

   When the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm. The perimeter \( P \) of a square is given by:

- The amount each son receives as \( 5x \) (since each son receives five times as much as each nephew).

Now, we know the man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Therefore, the total amount distributed can be expressed as:

A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an arithmetic progression (A.P.).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The ages of the club members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.).
   - The common difference of the A.P. is 3 months, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) years.
   - The youngest member is 7 years old.
   - The sum of the ages of all members is 250 years.

2. **Formulating the A.P.:**
   - Let the number of members be \( n \).
   - The ages of the members can be represented as: 
     \[
     7, 7 + \frac{1}{4}, 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4}, \ldots, 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     7, 7.25, 7.5, \ldots, 7 + \frac{n-1}{4}
     \]

3. **Sum of the A.P.:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic progression is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
   - Here, the first term \( a = 7 \) and the last term \( l = 7 + \frac{n-1}{4} \).
   - The sum of the ages is given as 250, so:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} \times \left(7 + \left(7 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)\right) = 250
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     7 + 7 + \frac{n-1}{4} = 14 + \frac{n-1}{4}

   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right) = 250

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     n \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right) = 500
     \]
   - Distribute \( n \):

   - Simplify:
     \[
     n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 56 \), \( c = -2000 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 56^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3136 + 8000 = 11136
     \]
   - Calculate \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 \pm \sqrt{11136}}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{11136} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{11136} = 105.5 \text{ (approximately)}

   - Therefore:
     \[

   - The positive solution is:
     \[
     n = \frac{49.5}{2} = 24.75

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator, which is \( M(M - 3) \):

\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D \cdot M - D \cdot (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]

Given:
- \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day can complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days.

We can express the total amount of work done as:
\[ \text{Total work} = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Number of hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days}) \]

For the given scenario:
\[ x \times x \times x = x^3 \text{ units of work} \]

Now, we need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

Using the same formula for total work:
\[ \text{Total work} = y \times y \times y = y^3 \text{ units of work} \]

Now, we need to find the relationship between the work done by \( x \) men and \( y \) men. Since \( x^3 \) units of work is done by \( x \) men, we can set up a proportion to find the equivalent work done by \( y \) men:

The work done by \( y \) men in terms of the work done by \( x \) men is:

A)5%
B)15%
C)25%
D)35%
E)45%",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Let's define:
- \( W \) as the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation.
- \( S \) as the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation.
- \( W \cap S \) as the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation.
- \( N \) as the percentage of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

From the problem, we have:
- \( W = 75\% \) (75 percent take a winter vacation)
- \( W \cap S = 40\% \) (40 percent take both a winter and a summer vacation)
- \( N = 20\% \) (20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation)

We need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is represented by \( S - W \cap S \).

First, let's find the percentage of employees who take at least one vacation (either winter or summer or both). This is given by:
\[ 100\% - N = 100\% - 20\% = 80\% \]

This 80% includes those who take only a winter vacation, only a summer vacation, and both vacations.

Now, we know:
\[ W + S - W \cap S = 80\% \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 75\% + S - 40\% = 80\% \]

Simplifying:
\[ 35\% + S = 80\% \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

So, 45% of employees take a summer vacation.

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:
\[ S - W \cap S = 45\% - 40\% = 5\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%.

First, we calculate the circumference of the circle traced by the point on the fan blade. The radius of this circle is 10 centimeters. The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle is:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]

where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting the given radius:

\[ C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ centimeters} \]

This is the distance traveled by the point in one complete revolution.

Next, we need to find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the number of revolutions per second is:

\[ \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ revolutions per second} \]

In 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is:

\[ \text{Total revolutions} = 5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ revolutions} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance traveled by the point on the fan blade in 150 revolutions. Since each revolution covers a distance of \( 20\pi \) centimeters, the total distance \( D \) is:

\[ x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Notice that the expression can be rewritten by completing the square in the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 = (\sqrt{n} + 2)^2 \]

Now, let's try to simplify the numerator in a similar way:

\[ n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)(n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4) + 16 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)(n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4) = n^2 - 16n + 16 \]

So, the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[ x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)(n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

Now, let's analyze the range of \( x \) for \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

Since \( n \) is in the range \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \), we can estimate the range of \( x \):

- For \( n = 36 \), \( x \approx 36 - 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 24 + 4 = 16 \)
- For \( n = 72 \), \( x \approx 72 - 4\sqrt{72} + 4 = 72 - 24 + 4 = 52 \)

Let's denote:
- A's investment = Rs. 40,000
- B's investment = Rs. 60,000
- C's investment = Rs. 120,000

The profit-sharing ratio is based on the product of the investment and the time for which the investment was active.

1. A was in the business for the entire year (12 months).
   - A's share = 40,000 * 12 = 480,000

2. B joined after 2 months, so he was in the business for 10 months.
   - B's share = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000

3. Let C join x months after B. Then C was in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) months.
   - C's share = 120,000 * (12 - (2 + x)) = 120,000 * (10 - x)

The total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000.

The ratio of C's share to the total profit is given by:
\[ \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{150,000}{375,000} \]

2. **Calculate the area of the semicircles:**
   - The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.
   - The radius of each semicircle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.
   - The area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is π × (10 cm)² = 100π cm².
   - The area of one semicircle is half of the full circle, so it is (1/2) × 100π cm² = 50π cm².

According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

   - After reaching B, Kevin would take \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours to return to A.
   - Therefore, the total time from being 70 miles away from B to completing the trip is \( \frac{d - 70}{70} + \frac{d}{90} \).

7. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, this remaining time is 3 hours.
   - So, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d - 70}{70} + \frac{d}{90} = 3

   - Simplify and solve for \( d \):
     \[
     9d - 630 + 7d = 1890

     \[
     16d - 630 = 1890

123,,"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?
A)22.5
B)84
C)21
D)24
E)25",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the unknown number be \( x \).

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from this number, it becomes one third of itself. This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ x - 30 = \frac{x}{3} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 3:

\[ 3(x - 30) = x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x - 90 = x \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[ 3x - x = 90 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 90 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{90}{2} \]

\[ x = 45 \]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we need to find 50% of this number:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 45 = \frac{50}{100} \times 45 \]

\[ = 0.5 \times 45 \]

\[ = 22.5 \]

- The man's rowing rate in still water is 4 kmph.
- The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Let's denote:
- \( v_m \) as the man's rate in still water = 4 kmph.
- \( v_c \) as the rate of the current.
- \( v_{against} \) as the man's rate against the current = 2 kmph.
- \( v_{along} \) as the man's rate along the current.

When rowing against the current, the effective speed is reduced by the speed of the current:
\[ v_{against} = v_m - v_c \]
\[ 2 = 4 - v_c \]
Solving for \( v_c \):
\[ v_c = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ kmph} \]

Now, to find the man's rate along the current, we add the speed of the current to his rate in still water:
\[ v_{along} = v_m + v_c \]
\[ v_{along} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ kmph} \]

We are given the following conditions:

1. The sum of the digits is 17:
   \[
   a + b + c = 17
   \]

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get the number with its digits reversed:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

   \[
   99a - 99c = 495

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)
3. \( a - c = 5 \)

From equation 3, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
\[
a = c + 5

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(c + 5) + b + c = 17

\[

\[
b = 12 - 2c

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) and \( b = 12 - 2c \) into equation 2:
\[
(c + 5)^2 + (12 - 2c)^2 + c^2 = 109

Expanding each term:
\[
(c + 5)^2 = c^2 + 10c + 25

\[
(12 - 2c)^2 = 144 - 48c + 4c^2

Substitute these into the equation:
\[
c^2 + 10c + 25 + 144 - 48c + 4c^2 + c^2 = 109
\]
\[
6c^2 - 38c + 169 = 109

\[
6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1

The roots are:
\[
c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}

This gives us:
\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(not an integer, discard)}

So, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back to find \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8

\[
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 6 = 6

Thus, the number is \( \overline{abc} = 863 \).

This gives:
\[

\[

Re-evaluate the number:
\[

1. **Alloy X Composition:**
   - Ratio of zinc to copper in X = 6:9
   - Total parts = 6 + 9 = 15
   - Zinc in X = (6/15) * 40 grams = 16 grams
   - Copper in X = (9/15) * 40 grams = 24 grams

2. **Alloy Y Composition:**
   - Ratio of zinc to copper in Y = 7:11
   - Total parts = 7 + 11 = 18
   - Zinc in Y = (7/18) * 60 grams = 23.33 grams
   - Copper in Y = (11/18) * 60 grams = 36.67 grams

3. **Alloy Z Composition:**
   - Total zinc in Z = Zinc in X + Zinc in Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper in Z = Copper in X + Copper in Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams

4. **Ratio of Zinc to Copper in Alloy Z:**
   - Ratio = 39.33 : 60.67

To simplify the ratio, we can multiply both parts by 3 to eliminate the decimals:

- Zinc = 39.33 * 3 = 118
- Copper = 60.67 * 3 = 182

Now, simplify the ratio 118:182 by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Given:
- Total income of the family per month = $9000
- Median income = $3000

The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. If the number of family members is odd, the median is the income of the middle person. If the number of family members is even, the median is the average of the two middle incomes.

Let's analyze the choices:

1. **If there are 2 members (Choice A):**
   - The median would be the average of the two incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two incomes could be $3000 and $3000. However, this would only sum to $6000, not $9000. So, this is not possible.

2. **If there are 3 members (Choice B):**
   - The median is the income of the second person when arranged in order. If the median is $3000, one possible distribution is $3000, $3000, and $3000, but this sums to $9000. However, this doesn't fit the condition of having a distinct median unless the incomes are $3000, $3000, and $3000, which is not possible since the total is $9000. So, this is not possible.

3. **If there are 4 members (Choice C):**
   - The median is the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes could be $3000 and $3000. This would mean the incomes could be $x, $3000, $3000, and $y. The total income is $9000, so $x + $3000 + $3000 + $y = $9000, which simplifies to $x + $y = $3000. This is possible with various combinations, such as $x = $0 and $y = $3000, or $x = $1500 and $y = $1500. So, this is possible.

4. **If there are 5 members (Choice D):**
   - The median is the income of the third person. For the median to be $3000, the third income must be $3000. The total income is $9000, so the sum of all incomes must be $9000. A possible distribution is $x, $y, $3000, $z, $w, where $x + $y + $3000 + $z + $w = $9000. This is possible with various combinations, such as $x = $0, $y = $0, $z = $3000, $w = $3000. So, this is possible.

5. **If there are 6 members (Choice E):**
   - The median is the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes could be $3000 and $3000. This would mean the incomes could be $x, $y, $3000, $3000, $z, $w. The total income is $9000, so $x + $y + $3000 + $3000 + $z + $w = $9000, which simplifies to $x + $y + $z + $w = $3000. This is possible with various combinations, such as $x = $0, $y = $0, $z = $1500, $w = $1500. So, this is possible.

The problem asks for the number of members in the family. The only choice that fits the condition of having a median of $3000 and a total income of $9000 is when there are 5 members.

2. **Determine the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - This means the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate.
   - Let the number of votes the losing candidate received be \( x \).
   - Then, the winning candidate received \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total votes:**
   - Total votes = Votes for winning candidate + Votes for losing candidate
   - 4,000 = 1.15x + x
   - 4,000 = 2.15x

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{4,000}{2.15} \approx 1,860.47 \)

5. **Calculate the votes for the winning candidate:**
   - Votes for winning candidate = 1.15x = 1.15 * 1,860.47 ≈ 2,139.54

Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number. However, it seems there was a miscalculation in the initial setup. Let's re-evaluate:

- If the winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes, then:
  - Winning candidate's votes = 50% + 15% = 65% of the eligible votes
  - 65% of 4,000 = 0.65 * 4,000 = 2,600

Thus, the winning candidate received 2,600 votes. However, this number does not match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- If the winning candidate won by 15% more than the losing candidate, then:
  - Let the losing candidate's votes be \( x \).
  - Winning candidate's votes = \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \)
  - Total votes = 4,000 = 1.15x + x = 2.15x
  - \( x = \frac{4,000}{2.15} \approx 1,860.47 \)
  - Winning candidate's votes = 1.15 * 1,860.47 ≈ 2,139.54

Re-evaluating the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes, not 15% more than the losing candidate. Therefore, the correct calculation should be:

- Winning candidate's votes = 65% of 4,000 = 2,600

However, this still does not match any of the given choices. Let's check the choices again:

136,,"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
A)4
B)3
C)2
D)1
E)0",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought up to earn exactly $3.40, given that she earns 20 cents per copper coin and 25 cents per brass coin.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.
- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The total earnings from copper coins is \( 20x \) cents, and from brass coins is \( 25y \) cents. The total earnings from both types of coins is given by the equation:

\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) such that the equation holds true with \( x \) and \( y \) being non-negative integers.

First, simplify the equation by dividing everything by 5:

\[ 4x + 5y = 68 \]

Now, we need to find integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \) is minimized.

Rearrange the equation to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ 5y = 68 - 4x \]
\[ y = \frac{68 - 4x}{5} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 68 - 4x \) must be divisible by 5. Let's find the values of \( x \) that satisfy this condition:

Calculate \( 68 \mod 5 \):

\[ 68 \div 5 = 13 \text{ remainder } 3 \]

So, \( 68 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

For \( 68 - 4x \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), we need:

\[ 4x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]

The multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, since \( 4 \times 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).

Multiply both sides of the congruence by 4:

\[ 16x \equiv 12 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]

Thus, \( x = 5k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).

Substitute \( x = 5k + 2 \) back into the equation for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{68 - 4(5k + 2)}{5} \]
\[ y = \frac{68 - 20k - 8}{5} \]
\[ y = \frac{60 - 20k}{5} \]
\[ y = 12 - 4k \]

For \( y \) to be non-negative, \( 12 - 4k \geq 0 \):

\[ 12 \geq 4k \]
\[ 3 \geq k \]

The smallest non-negative integer \( k \) is 0, which gives:

\[ x = 5(0) + 2 = 2 \]
\[ y = 12 - 4(0) = 12 \]

Thus, the minimum number of copper coins is \( x = 2 \).

Winson's journey consists of two parts:
1. Running to school at 10 miles per hour.
2. Walking back home at 5 miles per hour.

The total time for the journey is 1 hour.

Let's denote:
- \( t_1 \) as the time taken to run to school.
- \( t_2 \) as the time taken to walk back home.

The relationship between distance, speed, and time is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the run to school:
\[ d = 10 \times t_1 \]
So, \( t_1 = \frac{d}{10} \).

For the walk back home:
\[ d = 5 \times t_2 \]
So, \( t_2 = \frac{d}{5} \).

The total time for the journey is 1 hour:
\[ t_1 + t_2 = 1 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):
\[ \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{5} = 1 \]

To solve this equation, find a common denominator:
\[ \frac{d}{10} + \frac{2d}{10} = 1 \]

Combine the fractions:
\[ \frac{3d}{10} = 1 \]

A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and work through the given information step by step.

Let \( y \) be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, and \( w \) be the number of white golf balls at the beginning of the day.

According to the problem, the total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is 600. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ y + w = 600 \]

By the end of the day, the store had sold 80% of its inventory. This means 20% of the inventory remains. Therefore, the number of golf balls sold is:
\[ 0.8 \times 600 = 480 \]

The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls. This means the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the initial number of white golf balls, \( w \).

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also \( w \).

Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is:
\[ w + w = 2w \]

We know that the total number of golf balls sold is 480, so:
\[ 2w = 480 \]

Solving for \( w \), we get:
\[ w = \frac{480}{2} = 240 \]

Now that we know \( w = 240 \), we can find \( y \) using the equation \( y + w = 600 \):
\[ y + 240 = 600 \]
\[ y = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Since the conditions are similar, these triangles are similar, and we can set up a proportion to find the height of the building.

Given:
- Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
- Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
- Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

Let the height of the building be \( h \).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height to the shadow length is the same for both the flagstaff and the building:

\[
\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{h}{28.75}

Now, solve for \( h \):

1. Cross-multiply to get:
   \[
   17.5 \times 28.75 = h \times 40.25

2. Calculate \( 17.5 \times 28.75 \):
   \[
   17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125

Given:
- The first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
- The second ant is 6 inches tall, and we need to find the length of its shadow.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the ant to the length of its shadow is the same for both ants. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{\text{Height of second ant}}{\text{Shadow of second ant}}

C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the cost of papering the walls and the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   - The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. 
   - Let the height of the room be \( h \).
   - Let the semi-perimeter of the room be \( s \).
   - According to the ratio, \( \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \) or \( h = \frac{2}{5}s \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls**:
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters.
   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total length of paper used is \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \) meters.

3. **Area of Walls**:
   - The area of the walls that needs to be papered is the total area minus the area for doors and windows.
   - The area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
   - Let the total area of the walls be \( A \).
   - The area to be papered is \( A - 15 \).

4. **Calculating the Total Area of the Walls**:
   - The total length of paper used is 130 meters, and each strip of paper is 0.5 meters wide.
   - Therefore, the total area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) sq.m.
   - So, \( A - 15 = 65 \).
   - Therefore, \( A = 80 \) sq.m.

5. **Relating the Area to the Dimensions of the Room**:
   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height of the room.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \).
   - Then, \( P \times h = 80 \).

6. **Using the Ratio**:
   - We know \( h = \frac{2}{5}s \) and \( s = \frac{P}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{P}{2} = \frac{P}{5} \).

7. **Substitute and Solve**:
   - Substitute \( h = \frac{P}{5} \) into the equation \( P \times h = 80 \).
   - \( P \times \frac{P}{5} = 80 \).
   - \( \frac{P^2}{5} = 80 \).
   - \( P^2 = 400 \).
   - \( P = 20 \).

8. **Find the Height**:
   - Since \( h = \frac{P}{5} \), we have \( h = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \).

Let's denote the consecutive integers as:
\[ -50, -49, -48, \ldots, (-50 + k - 1) \]

The sum of these \( k \) consecutive integers can be expressed as:
\[ (-50) + (-49) + (-48) + \ldots + (-50 + k - 1) \]

This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = -50 \) and the last term is \( -50 + k - 1 \). The number of terms is \( k \).

The sum \( S \) of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) \]
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-50 - 50 + k - 1) \]
\[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101) \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ k = \frac{-(-101) \pm \sqrt{(-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102)}}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10201 + 408}}{2} \]
\[ k = \frac{101 \pm \sqrt{10609}}{2} \]

Calculate the square root:
\[ \sqrt{10609} = 103 \]

Substitute back:
\[ k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2} \]

This gives two possible solutions:
1. \( k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = \frac{204}{2} = 102 \)
2. \( k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \)

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we discard \( k = -1 \).

In this problem, the quadratic equation is \( x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \), which means \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \).

Given that one of the roots \( r_1 = 1.5 \), we can use the product of the roots to find the other root \( r_2 \):

\[
r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{22}{1} = 22

Substituting \( r_1 = 1.5 \):

Substituting the values of \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):

\[

Converting 1.5 to a fraction:

D)$22.9
E)$40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the new selling price of each article after a 15% decrease in price.

Let's denote the original price of each article as \( p \).

After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article becomes \( 0.85p \).

According to the problem, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

Let's set up the equations:

1. The number of articles Anna could buy at the original price is \( \frac{300}{p} \).
2. The number of articles Anna can buy at the new price is \( \frac{300}{0.85p} \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:

\[
\frac{300}{0.85p} = \frac{300}{p} + 5

Now, let's solve for \( p \).

First, clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( 0.85p \cdot p \):

\[
300p = 300 \cdot 0.85p + 5 \cdot 0.85p \cdot p

Simplify:

\[
300p = 255p + 4.25p^2

After the shifts:
- Neha's new position from the left end = 12 + 2 = 14th position.

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

A) \( x > y \)

Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( x \) is negative and \( y \) is positive. Therefore, \( x > y \) cannot be true because a negative number cannot be greater than a positive number.

B) \( y^2 > x^2 \)

Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we cannot directly compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) based on the given information. This statement is not necessarily true.

C) \(-x^3 < y^2\)

This is the opposite of the condition \(-x^3 > y^2\), which we have established from the given condition. Therefore, this statement is false.

D) \(-x < y\)

Since \( x < 0 \), \(-x\) is positive. We need to determine if \(-x\) is less than \( y \). From \(-x^3 > y^2\), we know that \(-x\) is larger in magnitude than \( y \) when cubed and squared, respectively. However, this does not directly imply \(-x < y\). This statement is not necessarily true.

E) \( x < -y \)

Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \(-y\) is negative. We need to determine if \( x < -y \). Given that \(-x^3 > y^2\), it implies that \( x \) is more negative than \(-y\) is positive, which means \( x < -y \) is true.

Therefore, the statement that must be true is:

E) \( x < -y \)",False,,,,,

A)45

E)57",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far ant A travels before meeting ant B. 

First, we calculate the relative speed of the two ants moving towards each other. The relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:

- Speed of ant A = 9 cm/hour
- Speed of ant B = 6 cm/hour

Relative speed = 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour

Next, we find the time it takes for the ants to meet. Since they start 75 cm apart and move towards each other at a relative speed of 15 cm/hour, the time taken to meet is:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours

Now, we calculate the distance traveled by ant A in this time. Since ant A travels at 9 cm/hour, the distance it travels in 5 hours is:

Distance traveled by ant A = Speed of ant A * Time = 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm

A)9 Trousers
B)8 Trousers
C)10 Trousers
D)7 Trousers
E)11 Trousers",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with the given budget of Rs 810, while also buying shirts. 

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the number of trousers.
- \( S \) as the number of shirts.

The cost of each trouser is Rs 70, and the cost of each shirt is Rs 30. The total cost equation is:

\[ 70T + 30S = 810 \]

To maximize the number of trousers, we should first calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be bought if no shirts are purchased:

\[ 70T \leq 810 \]

Dividing both sides by 70:

\[ T \leq \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \]

Since \( T \) must be an integer, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11. However, we need to check if it's possible to buy 11 trousers and still have a non-negative number of shirts.

If \( T = 11 \):

\[ 70 \times 11 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 770 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 30S = 810 - 770 \]
\[ 30S = 40 \]
\[ S = \frac{40}{30} \approx 1.33 \]

Since \( S \) must also be an integer, buying 11 trousers is not possible because it results in a non-integer number of shirts.

Next, let's try \( T = 10 \):

\[ 70 \times 10 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 700 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 30S = 810 - 700 \]
\[ 30S = 110 \]
\[ S = \frac{110}{30} \approx 3.67 \]

Again, \( S \) is not an integer.

Now, let's try \( T = 9 \):

\[ 70 \times 9 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 630 + 30S = 810 \]
\[ 30S = 810 - 630 \]
\[ 30S = 180 \]
\[ S = \frac{180}{30} = 6 \]

Here, \( S \) is an integer. Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased while still allowing for an integer number of shirts is 9.

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher.

B)23
C)16
D)18
E)12",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the coin landed on heads such that neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money after 20 flips.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin landed on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin landed on tails.

We know that the total number of flips is 20, so:
\[ H + T = 20 \]

For each head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, so the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is \( 2H \).

For each tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is \( 3T \).

Since neither of them won or lost any money, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan must equal the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

We can solve this system of equations. From the second equation, express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute this expression for \( T \) into the first equation:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{3H}{3} + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]
\[ \frac{5H}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( H \):
\[ 5H = 60 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ H = 12 \]

Let's denote the distance between X and Y as \( D \).

1. **First Meeting:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time, Allen from X to Y and Bob from Y to X.
   - They meet for the first time after traveling for some time \( t_1 \).
   - In this time, Allen covers a distance of \( 54t_1 \) and Bob covers a distance of \( 78t_1 \).
   - Since they meet, the sum of the distances they cover is equal to \( D \):
     \[
     54t_1 + 78t_1 = D
     \]
     \[
     132t_1 = D
     \]

2. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and then returns towards X, while Bob continues to X and then returns towards Y.
   - They meet for the second time after traveling for some additional time \( t_2 \).
   - By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.
   - The total distance covered by Allen by the second meeting is \( 54(t_1 + t_2) \).
   - The total distance covered by Bob by the second meeting is \( 78(t_1 + t_2) \).
   - The difference in the distances covered by Bob and Allen is 48 km:
     \[
     78(t_1 + t_2) - 54(t_1 + t_2) = 48

     \[
     t_1 + t_2 = 2

3. **Substitute \( t_1 \) and Solve for \( D \):**
   - We know \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \) and \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \).
   - Substitute \( t_1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{D}{132} + t_2 = 2

     \[
     t_2 = 2 - \frac{D}{132}

     \[
     \frac{D}{132} + \left(2 - \frac{D}{132}\right) = 2

     \[
     24 \times 2 = 48

   - This confirms our calculations are consistent, and we need to solve for \( D \) using \( t_1 = \frac{D}{132} \):
     \[
     \frac{D}{132} = 2 - t_2
     \]
   - Since \( t_1 + t_2 = 2 \), we have:

     \frac{D}{132} + \left(2 - \frac{D}{132}\right) = 2

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - Cost of new tires = $180 per tire
   - Lifespan of new tires = 4 years
   - Average cost per year for new tires = Total cost / Lifespan = $180 / 4 = $45 per year

2. **Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires:**
   - Cost of repairing current tires = $40 per tire

Given:
- \( P = 5000 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.12 \) (12% annual interest rate)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded every six months, so twice a year)

   - We have a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres.
   - We need to find the cost of gardening a 1-metre wide boundary around this plot at a rate of 10 per square metre.

2. **Finding the Dimensions of the Plot:**
   - Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) metres and the width be \( w \) metres.

   - The boundary is 1 metre wide around the plot, so the outer dimensions of the boundary will be \( (l + 2) \) metres by \( (w + 2) \) metres.
   - The area of the outer rectangle (including the boundary) is: \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \).
   - The area of the original rectangle (without the boundary) is: \( l \times w \).

4. **Area of the Boundary:**
   - The area of the boundary is the difference between the area of the outer rectangle and the area of the original rectangle:

Let's denote the total number of flowers the bee flies by as \( x \).

The bee bypasses 0.05% of these flowers, which means:
\[
0.05\% \times x = 8
\]

First, convert the percentage to a decimal:
\[
0.05\% = \frac{0.05}{100} = 0.0005

First, calculate the number of phones in one crate:
- Since each pallet holds 1250 phones, the number of phones in one crate is \( 1250 \times p \).

Now, calculate the number of phones in 4 crates:
- The number of phones in 4 crates is \( 4 \times (1250 \times p) = 5000p \).

   - B's work rate is 1 wall per 45 minutes, or \( \frac{1}{45} \) of the wall per minute.

A)43 seconds
B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.

First, let's understand the situation:
- The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
- The tunnel is 1 mile long.
- It takes the train 3 seconds to enter the tunnel completely.

Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, this means that the length of the train is covered in 3 seconds at the speed of 120 miles per hour.

Let's calculate the length of the train:
- Speed of the train = 120 miles per hour = 120 miles/3600 seconds = 1/30 miles per second.
- In 3 seconds, the train covers a distance of (1/30 miles/second) * 3 seconds = 1/10 miles.

So, the length of the train is 1/10 miles.

Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to consider the time it takes for the entire train to clear the tunnel.

The total distance the train needs to cover to completely pass through the tunnel is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train:
- Total distance = 1 mile (tunnel) + 1/10 mile (train) = 1.1 miles.

Now, calculate the time it takes to cover 1.1 miles at 120 miles per hour:
- Time = Distance / Speed = 1.1 miles / 120 miles per hour = 1.1 / 120 hours.

Convert this time into seconds:
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so 1.1 / 120 hours = (1.1 / 120) * 3600 seconds = 33 seconds.

Therefore, it will take the train 33 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

C)227.67
D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered by the invoice terms.

The invoice terms are 4/30, n/100, which means the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

1. **Calculate the Discount:**
   - The invoice amount is $20,000.
   - The discount is 4%, so the discount amount is \( 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800 \).
   - Therefore, if the merchant pays within 30 days, he pays \( 20,000 - 800 = 19,200 \).

2. **Calculate the Effective Interest Rate:**
   - If the merchant does not take the discount, he pays the full $20,000 in 100 days.
   - By taking the discount, he saves $800 by paying $19,200 in 30 days instead of $20,000 in 100 days.
   - The interest saved by taking the discount is $800 for the 70 days difference (100 days - 30 days).

3. **Calculate the Simple Interest Rate:**
   - The interest saved ($800) is effectively the interest on $19,200 for 70 days.
   - The formula for simple interest is \( \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{\text{Time}}{360} \).
   - Here, the principal is $19,200, the interest is $800, and the time is 70 days.
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for the rate: 
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest} \times 360}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} = \frac{800 \times 360}{19,200 \times 70}
     \]
   - Calculate the rate:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{288,000}{1,344,000} = 0.2142857
     \]
   - Convert the rate to a percentage: \( 0.2142857 \times 100 = 21.42857\% \).

4. **Annualize the Rate:**
   - Since the rate is for 70 days, we need to annualize it to find the equivalent annual rate.
   - The annualized rate is \( 21.42857\% \times \frac{360}{70} \).
   - Calculate the annualized rate:

We are given that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of parts in the mixture:

Let the total number of parts be \( x \).

The ratio of rice is \(\frac{2}{2+3+5} = \frac{2}{10}\).

Since 3 pounds of rice corresponds to 2 parts, we can set up the equation:

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \) in both equations:
\[
2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150 \implies 2s + 4e = 300
\]

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:
\[
(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300
\]
\[
2s + 4e - 2s - 3e = 0
\]
\[
e = 0

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the first equation:
\[
s + 2(0) = 150 \implies s = 150

Let's break down each expression:

1. **Expression \( L(x, y) \):**

  - If \(\epsilon + \delta < 1\), then \([x + y] = a + b\).
  - If \(\epsilon + \delta \geq 1\), then \([x + y] = a + b + 1\).
  - For \(R(x, y)\), \([2x] = [2a + 2\epsilon]\) and \([2y] = [2b + 2\delta]\).
  - If \(0 < \epsilon < 0.5\), then \([2x] = 2a\); if \(0.5 \leq \epsilon < 1\), then \([2x] = 2a + 1\).
  - Similarly for \([2y]\).

- If \(x\) and \(y\) are integers, \(L(x, y) = R(x, y)\).
- If \(x\) and \(y\) are not integers, it is possible for \(L(x, y) \neq R(x, y)\) depending on the values of \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\).

Therefore, it is not impossible to find two positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(L(x, y) = R(x, y)\). In fact, it is possible when \(x\) and \(y\) are integers.

D)After 24 minutes
E)none",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which the three bells ring. The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
   - 40 = 2^3 * 5
   - 48 = 2^4 * 3

2. **Find the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - The highest power of 2 is 2^4.
   - The highest power of 3 is 3^2.
   - The highest power of 5 is 5.

   Therefore, the LCM is:
   \[
   LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 16 \times 9 \times 5

Since the conditions are similar, these triangles are similar, and we can set up a proportion to find the height of the tree.

Given:
- Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
- Shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters
- Shadow of the tree = 15 meters

Let the height of the tree be \( h \).

The proportion based on similar triangles is:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of the pole}}{\text{Shadow of the pole}} = \frac{\text{Height of the tree}}{\text{Shadow of the tree}}

Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 km

Now, calculate the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours:

B)1/9
C)23/90
D)5/18
E)13/45",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Probability that Alan answers correctly**: Alan guesses randomly, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability that Roger answers correctly**: Roger cheats, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Probability that Peter answers correctly**: Peter performs the calculations, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

We want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the cases where either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

The probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not Roger, can be calculated as follows:

- **Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger does not**: 
  - Probability that Alan answers correctly: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
  - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \)

- **Probability that Peter answers correctly and Roger does not**:
  - Probability that Peter answers correctly: \( \frac{5}{6} \)
  - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \)

Now, we add these probabilities together to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:

\[
\frac{1}{15} + \frac{5}{18}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 18 is 90.

- Convert \( \frac{1}{15} \) to a fraction with denominator 90: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{15} = \frac{6}{90}

- Convert \( \frac{5}{18} \) to a fraction with denominator 90:
  \[
  \frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{90}

B)12%

E)4%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest at which the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for 2 years on a principal amount of Rs. 5000 is Rs. 72.

Let's denote the rate of interest as \( r\% \).

1. **Simple Interest (S.I.) Calculation:**

   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
   \]
   where \( P = 5000 \), \( t = 2 \) years, and \( r \) is the rate of interest.

   \[
   \text{S.I.} = \frac{5000 \times r \times 2}{100} = 100r
   \]

2. **Compound Interest (C.I.) Calculation:**

   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t - P
   \]

   For 2 years, this becomes:
   \[
   \text{C.I.} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^2 - 5000
   \]

   Expanding the expression:
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2r}{100} + \frac{r^2}{10000}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{C.I.} = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{2r}{100} + \frac{r^2}{10000}\right) - 5000
   \]
   \[
   \text{C.I.} = 5000 + 100r + \frac{5000r^2}{10000} - 5000
   \]
   \[
   \text{C.I.} = 100r + \frac{r^2}{2}
   \]

3. **Difference between C.I. and S.I.:**

   Given that the difference is Rs. 72:
   \[
   \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72
   \]
   \[
   100r + \frac{r^2}{2} - 100r = 72

   \[
   \frac{r^2}{2} = 72

   \[
   r^2 = 144

   \[
   r = \sqrt{144} = 12

Let's define:
- \( V \) as the number of files infected by a virus.
- \( W \) as the number of files infected by a worm.
- \( B \) as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of files is 250.
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be expressed as \( W - B = 2.5B \).

We need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. This is equivalent to finding the number of files infected only by a virus, which is \( V - B \).

Let's solve the equations:
- From the total number of files, we have:
  \[
  V + W - B = 250
  \]
  Substituting \( V = 125 \) into the equation, we get:
  \[
  125 + W - B = 250

  Simplifying, we find:
  \[
  W - B = 125

- We also have the equation from the problem statement:
  \[
  W - B = 2.5B

Now, we equate the two expressions for \( W - B \):
\[
125 = 2.5B

Solving for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{125}{2.5} = 50

Now that we have \( B = 50 \), we can find \( W \) using \( W - B = 125 \):
\[
W - 50 = 125

\[
W = 175
\]

Finally, we find the number of files not infected by a worm, which is \( V - B \):
\[
V - B = 125 - 50 = 75

Let's denote Mohan's share as \( M \) and Sohan's share as \( S \). According to the problem, the total amount to be divided is Rs. 5100, so we have:

\[ M + S = 5100 \]

Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will reach 26 in 3 years. Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will reach 26 in 2 years.

The future value of Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% compound interest is given by:

\[ M \times (1 + 0.04)^3 \]

The future value of Sohan's share after 2 years at 4% compound interest is given by:

According to the problem, these future values should be equal:

\[ M \times (1.04)^3 = S \times (1.04)^2 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ M \times 1.124864 = S \times 1.0816 \]

Substitute \( S = 5100 - M \) into the equation:

\[ M \times 1.124864 = (5100 - M) \times 1.0816 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 1.124864M = 5512.16 - 1.0816M \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 1.124864M + 1.0816M = 5512.16 \]

Solve for \( M \):

First, let's calculate the volume of the original alloy coin:
- The coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm.
- The radius of the coin is 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm.
- The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or thickness in this case).

So, the volume of the original coin is:
\[ V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \, \text{mm}^3. \]

We are told that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the coin is half of the total volume:
\[ V_{\text{Al}} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \, \text{mm}^3. \]

The weight of the original coin is 30 grams. Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, and silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can set up the following equations:
- Let \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \) be the density of aluminum and \( \rho_{\text{Ag}} = 2\rho_{\text{Al}} \) be the density of silver.
- The weight of aluminum in the coin is \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi \).
- The weight of silver in the coin is \( 2\rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi \).

The total weight of the coin is:

Solving for \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \):
\[ 3\rho_{\text{Al}} \times 56.25\pi = 30 \]
\[ \rho_{\text{Al}} = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi}. \]

Now, we need to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with dimensions 1 x 30 mm:
- The new coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.
- The radius of the new coin is 30 mm / 2 = 15 mm.
- The volume of the new coin is:
\[ V_{\text{new}} = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \, \text{mm}^3. \]

The weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is:
\[ \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = \rho_{\text{Al}} \times 225\pi = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \times 225\pi = \frac{10 \times 225}{56.25} = 40 \, \text{grams}. \]

In the given equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

For the roots to be real and distinct, we need:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Solving this inequality for \(k\):

\[
25 > 4k
\]

\[
\frac{25}{4} > k
\]

\[
k < 6.25
\]

Since \(k\) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of \(k\) for which the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots is 6.

However, upon reviewing the choices provided, it seems there is no option for \(k = 6\). Let's verify the choices:

- \(k = 9\): \(25 - 4 \times 9 = 25 - 36 = -11\) (not greater than 0)
- \(k = 7\): \(25 - 4 \times 7 = 25 - 28 = -3\) (not greater than 0)
- \(k = 3\): \(25 - 4 \times 3 = 25 - 12 = 13\) (greater than 0)
- \(k = 8\): \(25 - 4 \times 8 = 25 - 32 = -7\) (not greater than 0)
- \(k = 12\): \(25 - 4 \times 12 = 25 - 48 = -23\) (not greater than 0)

The only choice that satisfies the condition for real and distinct roots is \(k = 3\).

A)9 hours.
B)10 hours.
C)11 hours.
D)12 hours.
E)13 hours.",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km, considering her riding speed and rest breaks.

1. **Calculate the time taken to ride 15 km:**
   - Shweta rides at 10 km per hour.
   - Time to ride 15 km = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - 100 km / 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder.
   - This means she will complete 6 full segments of 15 km each and then have some distance left to cover.

3. **Calculate the remaining distance after 6 segments:**
   - Distance covered in 6 segments = 6 * 15 km = 90 km.
   - Remaining distance = 100 km - 90 km = 10 km.

4. **Calculate the time taken to ride the remaining 10 km:**
   - Time to ride 10 km = Distance / Speed = 10 km / 10 km per hour = 1 hour.

5. **Calculate the total riding time:**
   - Total riding time for 6 segments = 6 * 1.5 hours = 9 hours.
   - Plus the time for the remaining 10 km = 1 hour.
   - Total riding time = 9 hours + 1 hour = 10 hours.

6. **Calculate the total rest time:**
   - Shweta takes a 10-minute rest at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - Number of rests = 6 (one rest after each of the first 6 segments).
   - Total rest time = 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour.

7. **Calculate the total time (riding + rest):**
   - Total time = Total riding time + Total rest time = 10 hours + 1 hour = 11 hours.

Therefore, Shweta will take a total of 11 hours to cover 100 km.

- Let \( t \) be the time taken to travel one way by train.
- Let \( c \) be the time taken to travel one way by car.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   t + c = 17
   \]

2. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that traveling both ways by train takes 4 hours more than traveling one way by train and one way by car:
   \[
   2t = 17 + 4 = 21

From equation (2), we can solve for \( t \):
\[
2t = 21 \implies t = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5

Now, substitute \( t = 10.5 \) into equation (1) to find \( c \):
\[
10.5 + c = 17 \implies c = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5

B)25%
C)30%
D)35%
E)40%",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the original dog food remains in the bowl right before the dog begins to eat at noon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Food:**
   - Let the initial amount of food in the bowl be 1 (or 100%).

2. **8:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the food remaining.
   - Remaining food = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the original amount.

3. **9:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) - (1/3)*(2/3) = (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9 of the original amount.

4. **10:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (4/9) - (1/3)*(4/9) = (4/9)*(2/3) = 8/27 of the original amount.

5. **11:00 am Feeding:**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (8/27) - (1/3)*(8/27) = (8/27)*(2/3) = 16/81 of the original amount.

Now, we need to convert the remaining amount of food into a percentage of the original amount:

- Remaining food as a percentage = (16/81) * 100%

From the problem, we know:
1. 60% of the people surveyed were women, so \( W = 0.6T \).
2. Therefore, the remaining 40% were men, so \( M = 0.4T \).
3. Of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars, and 25% preferred green cars.
4. 10 men liked green cars more than red.

Since 25% of the men preferred green cars, we can set up the equation:

The boy can reach the \( n \)-th step by either:
1. Taking a single step from the \( (n-1) \)-th step.
2. Taking two steps from the \( (n-2) \)-th step.

Thus, the recurrence relation is:
\[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]

We need initial conditions to start the sequence:
- \( f(0) = 1 \): There is one way to be at the ground (doing nothing).
- \( f(1) = 1 \): There is one way to reach the first step (a single step).

C)1.25
D)1.5
E)2",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to the existing mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the total mixture.

Initially, we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which consists of:
- 40% orange juice = 0.4 gallons of orange juice
- 60% water = 0.6 gallons of water

Let \( x \) be the number of additional gallons of orange juice to be added. After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice will be \( 0.4 + x \) gallons, and the total volume of the mixture will be \( 1 + x \) gallons.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)

Expanding the right side:
\[
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( x \):
\[
0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6

\[
0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6

Subtract 0.4 from both sides:
\[
0.4x = 0.2

Divide both sides by 0.4:

First, let's consider the total number of ways Mr. Jain can select two horses from the five available horses. This can be calculated using combinations:

\[
\text{Total ways to select 2 horses from 5} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10

Next, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways Mr. Jain can select two horses such that one of them is the winning horse. 

Assume there is exactly one winning horse in the race. Mr. Jain needs to select this winning horse and one other horse from the remaining four horses. The number of ways to do this is:

\[
\text{Ways to select 1 winning horse and 1 other horse} = \binom{4}{1} = 4

This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875 is divisible by \( N \):

\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]

So, \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers.

First, let's factor 1397 to find its divisors. We start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers:

- 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- Sum of digits of 1397 is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), not divisible by 3.
- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- Check divisibility by 7: \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \), not an integer.
- Check divisibility by 11: Alternating sum of digits is \( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \), divisible by 11.

So, 1397 is divisible by 11. Let's divide:

\[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]

Now, we have \( 1397 = 11 \times 127 \).

Both 11 and 127 are prime numbers. The divisors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. Among these, the only 3-digit number is 127.

\[ 2w + 9 = 37 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2w = 28 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ w = 14 \]

Now we have the dimensions of the rectangle: \( l = 9 \) feet and \( w = 14 \) feet.

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:

\[ A = l \times w = 9 \times 14 = 126 \]

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 10 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 10) = \frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \frac{10!}{10! \times 0!}

We know that \( 0! = 1 \), so the equation simplifies to:

\[

D)67
E)40",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the new man who replaces the oarsman weighing 53 kg, resulting in an average weight increase of 1.8 kg for the 10 oarsmen.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Total Weight of the Crew:**
   - Let the initial average weight of the 10 oarsmen be \( x \) kg.
   - Therefore, the total initial weight of the crew is \( 10x \) kg.

2. **New Average Weight:**
   - The average weight increases by 1.8 kg, so the new average weight is \( x + 1.8 \) kg.
   - The new total weight of the crew is \( 10(x + 1.8) \) kg.

3. **Weight of the New Man:**
   - The new total weight of the crew can also be expressed as the initial total weight minus the weight of the replaced man plus the weight of the new man.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     10(x + 1.8) = 10x - 53 + \text{weight of the new man}
     \]

4. **Solving for the Weight of the New Man:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     10x + 18 = 10x - 53 + \text{weight of the new man}
     \]
   - Rearrange to find the weight of the new man:
     \[
     \text{weight of the new man} = 10x + 18 + 53 - 10x
     \]
     \[
     \text{weight of the new man} = 71

Thus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg.

A)11

C)9

E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of balls in the box, which is \( n \). Since the ball marked with the number 3 cannot be selected, we are left with \( n - 1 \) balls to choose from.

The number of ways to select 2 balls from \( n - 1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = 45
\]

We need to solve this equation for \( n \).

The combination formula is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

Setting this equal to 45, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \).

Calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-88) = 9 + 352 = 361
\]

The square root of 361 is 19. So, the solutions for \( n \) are:

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( n \):

1. \( n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \)
2. \( n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = \frac{-16}{2} = -8 \)

A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only
E)I and III only",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which a positive integer \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors.

The number of factors of a positive integer \( n \) with the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k} \) is given by the formula:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1)
\]

We want this product to equal 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if one of the terms in the product is 5 and all others are 1. This means that the prime factorization of \( Q \) must be of the form \( Q = p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because:

\[
(4 + 1) = 5
\]

Thus, \( Q \) must be the fourth power of a prime number.

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

I. Q is the square of a prime number.
   - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors is \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which is not 5. So, this statement is false.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
   - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This statement is true.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
   - If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, then the number of factors is \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), which is not 5. So, this statement is false.

2. **With Membership:**

2. **Calculate the work Jack has completed:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work he has completed is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the yacht.

First, we find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3. \]

The Euler's Totient Function, \( \phi(n) \), gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right), \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is:

Therefore, in \( f - j \) years, Joe will be as old as his father, and Joe's sister will be \( s + (f - j) \) years old. According to the problem, this age will be twice her current age:
   \[
   s + (f - j) = 2s

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. The difference in age between Joe's sister and their father is \( f - s \). Therefore, in \( f - s \) years, Joe's sister will be as old as their father, and Joe's father will be \( f + (f - s) \) years old. According to the problem, this age will be twice the age of the father when the sister was as old as her father:
   \[
   f + (f - s) = 2(f - (f - s))
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2f - s = 2s
   \]
   \[
   2f = 3s
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( j + s + f = 100 \)
2. \( f - j = s \)
3. \( 2f = 3s \)

From equation (3), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( f \):
\[
s = \frac{2f}{3}
\]

Substitute \( s = \frac{2f}{3} \) into equation (2):
\[
f - j = \frac{2f}{3}
\]
\[
j = f - \frac{2f}{3} = \frac{f}{3}
\]

Now substitute \( j = \frac{f}{3} \) and \( s = \frac{2f}{3} \) into equation (1):
\[
\frac{f}{3} + \frac{2f}{3} + f = 100
\]
\[
\frac{f + 2f + 3f}{3} = 100
\]
\[
\frac{6f}{3} = 100
\]
\[
2f = 100
\]
\[
f = 50
\]

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is \( \boxed{50} \).",False,,,,,

According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of \( x \) is 21. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times x = 21
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times x = 21

Given:
- \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \).

This can be written as:
\[
x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y
\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[
x = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{4my}{100}

We need to find \( m \) as a percentage of \( x \). This means we need to express \( m \) in terms of \( x \) and then find what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \).

From the equation \( x = \frac{4my}{100} \), we can solve for \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{100x}{4y}
\]

Now, we want to find what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \):
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{x}\right) \times 100

Substitute \( m = \frac{100x}{4y} \) into the percentage formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\frac{100x}{4y}}{x}\right) \times 100

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 registered voters),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (in this case, exactly 4 voters who voted),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 90% or 0.9),

Let's calculate the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 registered voters voted in the last election:

1. Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):
   \[
   \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4! \cdot (5-4)!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{4! \times 1!} = 5

A)58
B)62

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the yard (the side that will not be fenced, which is 10 meters),
- \( W \) as the width of the yard.

Given:
- The area of the yard is 240 square meters.
- One side (length) is 10 meters.

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ L \times W = \text{Area} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 10 \times W = 240 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \]

Now, we know the dimensions of the yard are:
- Length \( L = 10 \) meters (unfenced side),
- Width \( W = 24 \) meters.

Alice needs to fence the other three sides, which include two widths and one length. Therefore, the total amount of fencing required is:

1. **Middle Letter (Vowel):**  
   There are 5 vowels available. The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.

2. **First and Third Letters (Consonants):**  
   There are 20 consonants available. The first and third letters must be consonants and must be different from each other.

   - For the first letter, we have 20 choices (since it can be any consonant).
   - For the third letter, we have 19 choices (since it must be a different consonant from the first letter).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Codes:**
   - Number of choices for the first letter (consonant) = 20
   - Number of choices for the middle letter (vowel) = 5
   - Number of choices for the third letter (different consonant) = 19

3. **Solve the equation \( n^3 - n = 2184 \):**

   We can try different values of \( n \) to find the one that satisfies the equation. Let's start with an estimate:

1. Convert the driving time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Driving time in hours} = \frac{9 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.15 \text{ hours}

\[ \text{Rate of P} = \frac{1 \text{ jar}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]

Next, let's find the rate at which Q eats the candies. If Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, then Q's rate is:

\[ \text{Rate of Q} = \frac{0.5 \text{ jar}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{0.5}{5} \text{ jars per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ jars per minute} \]
