After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a car moving towards a tower. The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

### Step 2: Set Up the Problem
Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.

From trigonometry, we know:
- \(\tan(45^\circ) = 1\), so \( h = x_1 \).
- \(\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( h = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \).

### Step 3: Relate the Distances
From the above equations, we have:
\[ x_1 = h \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Distance Traveled
The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Speed of the Car
The speed of the car is the distance traveled divided by the time taken:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the Remaining Distance
The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \):
\[ x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \]

### Step 7: Calculate the Time to Reach the Base
The time \( t \) to reach the base of the tower is the remaining distance divided by the speed:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} \]

Simplifying:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} \]
\[ t = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} \]
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

### Step 8: Simplify the Expression
Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \]
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} \]
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
\[ t = 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) \]

A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the item.

2. **Apply the Discount:**
   - The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( x - 0.22x = 0.78x \).

3. **Apply the Coupon:**
   - The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is \( 0.78x - 20 \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Start by simplifying and solving for \( x \):
     \[
     0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
     \]
   - Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80
     \]
     \[
     1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80

   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     0.56x - 40 = 3.80

   - Add 40 to both sides:
     \[
     0.56x = 43.80

   - Divide by 0.56 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{43.80}{0.56} = 78.2142857

E)7",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given choices is a multiple of a number \( X \) that is divisible by both 9 and 12. 

### Step 1: Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12

To find a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.

- The prime factorization of 9 is \( 3^2 \).
- The prime factorization of 12 is \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- For the prime number 2, the highest power is \( 2^2 \).
- For the prime number 3, the highest power is \( 3^2 \).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is:
\[ 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Check the Choices

Now, we need to check which of the given choices is a multiple of 36.

- **A) 36**: 36 is a multiple of 36 (since \( 36 \div 36 = 1 \)).
- **B) 15**: 15 is not a multiple of 36 (since \( 15 \div 36 \) is not an integer).
- **C) 17**: 17 is not a multiple of 36 (since \( 17 \div 36 \) is not an integer).
- **D) 5**: 5 is not a multiple of 36 (since \( 5 \div 36 \) is not an integer).
- **E) 7**: 7 is not a multiple of 36 (since \( 7 \div 36 \) is not an integer).

A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is 0.74.

We are interested in finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both stocks do not increase in value.

The probability that Stock A does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase in value is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither stock increases, we need to consider the scenario where the events are independent. In this case, the probability that neither stock increases is the product of the probabilities that each stock does not increase:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = (1 - P(A)) \times (1 - P(B)) = 0.44 \times 0.26. \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This implies considering the worst-case scenario where the events are not independent and the probability of neither event occurring is maximized.

The greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.26.

C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360.

### Understanding the Problem:
- **Selling Price (SP):** Rs. 360
- **Profit Percentage:** 20%

The relationship between cost price (CP), selling price (SP), and profit percentage is given by the formula:

\[ \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit} \]

Since profit is 20% of the cost price, we can express it as:

\[ \text{Profit} = 0.20 \times \text{CP} \]

Substituting this into the SP formula, we get:

\[ \text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.20 \times \text{CP} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{SP} = 1.20 \times \text{CP} \]

### Plan:
1. Use the formula \( \text{SP} = 1.20 \times \text{CP} \) to find the cost price.
2. Substitute the given selling price (Rs. 360) into the equation.
3. Solve for CP.

### Solving the Problem:
1. Substitute SP = 360 into the equation:

   \[ 360 = 1.20 \times \text{CP} \]

2. Solve for CP:

   \[ \text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.20} \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Format:**
   - The bike number format is: **LLNN**, where L represents a letter and N represents a number.

2. **Calculating the Number of Combinations:**
   - **Letters (LL):**
     - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A to Z).
     - If the letters need to be distinct, the first letter can be any of the 26 letters, and the second letter can be any of the remaining 25 letters.
     - Therefore, the number of combinations for the letters is: \(26 \times 25\).

   - **Numbers (NN):**
     - There are 10 possible digits (0 to 9).
     - Each digit can be used independently, so the first number can be any of the 10 digits, and the second number can also be any of the 10 digits.

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after a quarter of the distance. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Distance Covered Before the Rain:**
   - The rain starts after the train has covered a quarter of the total distance.
   - A quarter of the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Time Taken Before the Rain:**
   - The train travels the first 250 miles at 100 miles/hour.
   - Time taken to cover 250 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{\text{Distance before rain}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance after the rain starts is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Time Taken After the Rain Starts:**
   - The train travels the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour.
   - Time taken to cover 750 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time after rain} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Speed after rain}} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Journey Duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken before and after the rain:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = \text{Time before rain} + \text{Time after rain} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

   - Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night.
   - Let \( D \) be the set of students who took part in the debating session.
   - We want to find the maximum number of students who are in neither \( P \) nor \( D \), i.e., \( |P \cup D|^c \).

3. **Calculate the minimum number of students who attended at least one event:**
   - The minimum number of students who attended at least one event is given by:
     \[
     |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D|
     \]
   - To maximize the number of students who attended neither event, we need to minimize \( |P \cap D| \). The minimum value of \( |P \cap D| \) is 0 (if no student attended both events).

4. **Calculate the maximum number of students who attended neither event:**
   - Substitute the minimum value of \( |P \cap D| \) into the equation:
     \[
     |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 0 = 160
     \]
   - Therefore, the maximum number of students who attended neither event is:
     \[
     200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 160 = 40
     \]

5. **Check the choices:**
   - The calculated maximum number of students who attended neither event is 40, which is not listed among the choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure no oversight.

6. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - If we assume some overlap between the two groups, the number of students who attended neither event could be higher. Let's assume the maximum overlap:
     \[
     |P \cap D| = 60 \text{ (maximum overlap possible)}
     \]
   - Recalculate:
     \[
     |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 60 = 100
     \]
   - Therefore, the maximum number of students who attended neither event is:
     \[
     200 - 100 = 100
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 100, which is not listed among the choices. However, the closest choice is 99, which suggests a slight adjustment in overlap calculation or rounding in the problem statement.

Thus, the answer is:

E)5,000",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of staplers produced on Monday, given the information about defective and mistakenly rejected staplers.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).

3. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

4. **Mistakenly Rejected Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of mistakenly rejected staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

5. **Given Information:**
   - We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, we set up the equation:

D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of production for each machine:**
   - Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
   - Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of production:**
   - The combined rate of production for both machines is the sum of their individual rates:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ yo-yos per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine the time required to produce 10 yo-yos:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time in minutes required to produce 10 yo-yos. Using the combined rate of production, we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \), we multiply both sides by 18 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5t = 180

   - The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is \( x \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Profit Calculation:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Bag:**
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 × $100 = $25.

3. **Determine the Number of Bags Sold:**

A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The total hours worked by Alex is \( 7x \) (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The total hours worked by Jacob is \( 9y \) (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both of them worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7x \approx 9y \]

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can assume:
\[ 7x = 9y \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \)
2. \( 7x = 9y \)

Let's solve these equations:

From equation 2, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = \frac{9}{7}y \]

Substitute \( x = \frac{9}{7}y \) into equation 1:
\[ \frac{9}{7}y + y = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}y + \frac{7}{7}y = 35 \]

\[ \frac{16}{7}y = 35 \]

Multiply both sides by 7 to clear the fraction:
\[ 16y = 245 \]

Divide both sides by 16 to solve for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{245}{16} \]

\[ y = 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

E)None of these",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest on the borrowed amount.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Formula for Simple Interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount borrowed),
   - \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
   - \( T \) is the time in years.

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Principal (\( P \)) = Rs. 500
   - Rate of Interest (\( R \)) = 6% per annum
   - Time (\( T \)) = 4 years

3. **Calculate the Simple Interest:**
   Substitute the given values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} = \frac{12000}{100} = 120
   \]
   So, the simple interest for 4 years is Rs. 120.

4. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Paid:**
   The total amount Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. We can use the relationship between distance, speed, and time, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (in kilometers).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Speed = \( v \) km/hr
   - Distance = \( v \times 6 \)

3. **Return Journey:**
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Speed = \( v + 12 \) km/hr (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr)
   - Distance = \( (v + 12) \times 4 \)

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since the distance traveled in both the forward and return journeys is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

   \[
   v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4
   \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**

   \[
   6v = 4(v + 12)

   \[
   6v = 4v + 48
   \]

   \[
   6v - 4v = 48

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( W \) be the wholesale cost of the appliance.

2. **Determine the Original Retail Price:**
   - The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, the original retail price \( R \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sale Price:**
   - The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the sale price \( S \) is:
     \[
     S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R
     \]
   - Substitute the expression for \( R \):
     \[
     S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W

4. **Determine the Percentage Increase Over Wholesale Cost:**
   - The sale price is \( 1.28W \), which is \( 0.28W \) more than the wholesale cost \( W \).
   - To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{1.28W - W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{0.28W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = 28\%

32,,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand the situation described and use the information given to find the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet. Once we have the dimensions, we can calculate the area.

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Folding the Sheet:**
   - When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm.
   - When folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm.

2. **Rectangular Sheet:**
   - Let the original dimensions of the sheet be \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

### Plan

1. **Folding Along Length:**
   - When folded along the length, the width remains the same, and the length is halved.
   - The perimeter of each folded part is 48 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is: \( 2 \times \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48 \).

2. **Folding Along Width:**
   - When folded along the width, the length remains the same, and the width is halved.
   - The perimeter of each folded part is 66 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is: \( 2 \times \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66 \).

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Solve the two equations to find \( l \) and \( w \).

4. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: \( \text{Area} = l \times w \).

### Solving the Problem

1. **Equation from Folding Along Length:**
   \[
   2 \times \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Equation from Folding Along Width:**
   \[
   2 \times \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   From Equation 1: \( l + 2w = 48 \)

   From Equation 2: \( 2l + w = 66 \)

   Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
   \[
   2l + 4w = 96
   \]

   Subtract Equation 2 from this result:
   \[
   (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66
   \]
   \[
   3w = 30
   \]
   \[
   w = 10
   \]

   Substitute \( w = 10 \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   l + 2(10) = 48
   \]
   \[
   l + 20 = 48
   \]
   \[
   l = 28
   \]

4. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280
   \]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the area calculation:

The correct area calculation should be:

   - Take the square root:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = 5\sqrt{10}
     \]

4. **Find the Diameter of the Sphere:**
   - The diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
   - Therefore, the diameter is \(5\sqrt{10}\).

1. **Start at Home**: Assume the starting point (home) is at the origin of a coordinate system, (0, 0).

2. **Travel South 3 km**: Moving south decreases the y-coordinate. So, the new position is (0, -3).

3. **Travel East 5 km**: Moving east increases the x-coordinate. So, the new position is (5, -3).

4. **Travel North 3 km**: Moving north increases the y-coordinate. So, the new position is (5, 0).

5. **Travel West 2 km**: Moving west decreases the x-coordinate. So, the final position is (3, 0).

A)Rs. 697.50
B)Rs. 712.50
C)Rs. 787.50
D)Rs. 750
E)Rs. 780",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the watch based on the given conditions about discounts and profit. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Discounts and Profit:**
   - The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount and earns a certain profit.
   - If the discount is increased to 7%, the profit decreases by Rs. 15.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the marked price of the watch.

### Plan to Solve the Problem

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( M \) be the marked price of the watch.
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the watch.

2. **Calculate Selling Prices:**
   - Selling price with a 5% discount: \( SP_1 = M - 0.05M = 0.95M \)
   - Selling price with a 7% discount: \( SP_2 = M - 0.07M = 0.93M \)

3. **Profit Equations:**
   - Profit with 5% discount: \( P_1 = SP_1 - C = 0.95M - C \)
   - Profit with 7% discount: \( P_2 = SP_2 - C = 0.93M - C \)

4. **Profit Difference:**
   - According to the problem, \( P_1 - P_2 = 15 \)
   - Substitute the profit equations: \( (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15 \)

5. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 0.95M - 0.93M = 15 \)
   - \( 0.02M = 15 \)
   - Solve for \( M \): \( M = \frac{15}{0.02} = 750 \)

### Solution

The marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

### Verification

Let's verify by checking the calculations:
- With a 5% discount, the selling price is \( 0.95 \times 750 = 712.50 \).
- With a 7% discount, the selling price is \( 0.93 \times 750 = 697.50 \).
- The difference in selling prices is \( 712.50 - 697.50 = 15 \), which matches the given condition.

Thus, the marked price of the watch is indeed Rs. 750.

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. The salary is composed of a fixed amount plus a percentage of the sales. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Salary Structure
The shop assistant's monthly salary \( S \) is given by:
\[ S = \text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission from Sales} \]

According to the problem:
- The fixed salary is $500.
- The commission is 5% of the monthly sales.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
We want the total salary \( S \) to be $1500. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

### Step 3: Solve for Sales
To find the sales amount, we need to isolate the sales variable in the equation:
1. Subtract the fixed salary from both sides:
   \[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]
   \[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

2. Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for sales:
   \[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

3. Calculate the result:
   \[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Let's verify the solution by calculating the salary with $20000 in sales:
- Commission from sales: \( 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \)
- Total salary: \( 500 + 1000 = 1500 \)

The calculations confirm that with $20000 in sales, the shop assistant's salary will be $1500.

### Conclusion
The monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Therefore, the correct choice is:

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the average speed of the airplane as it flies around the four sides of a square. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The airplane flies along the four sides of a square.
   - The speeds for each side are 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.

2. **Assume the Side Length of the Square:**
   - Let's assume the side length of the square is \( s \) km. Therefore, the total distance traveled around the square is \( 4s \) km.

3. **Calculate the Time Taken for Each Side:**
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{200} \) hours.
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{400} \) hours.
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{600} \) hours.
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \( \frac{s}{800} \) hours.

4. **Calculate the Total Time Taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800}

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white and brown sharpeners Jack bought. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white sharpeners.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know that Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, so:
     \[
     w + b = 18
     \]
   - We also know that each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.
   - The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees, so:
     \[
     w(x + 1) + bx = 100
     \]

3. **Simplify the Cost Equation:**
   - Expand the cost equation:
     \[
     wx + w + bx = 100
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (w + b)x + w = 100
     \]
   - Since \( w + b = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     18x + w = 100
     \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( w + b = 18 \)
     2. \( 18x + w = 100 \)

   - From the first equation, express \( w \) in terms of \( b \):
     \[
     w = 18 - b
     \]

   - Substitute \( w = 18 - b \) into the second equation:
     \[
     18x + (18 - b) = 100
     \]
     \[
     18x + 18 - b = 100
     \]
     \[
     18x - b = 82
     \]

5. **Find Integer Solutions:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     b = 18x - 82
     \]
   - Since \( b \) must be a non-negative integer, solve for \( x \) such that \( b \) is an integer and \( 0 \leq b \leq 18 \).

   - Check integer values of \( x \):
     - If \( x = 5 \):
       \[
       b = 18(5) - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8
       \]
       - Then, \( w = 18 - b = 18 - 8 = 10 \)

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total cost:
     - Cost of brown sharpeners: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \)
     - Cost of white sharpeners: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
     - Total cost: \( 40 + 60 = 100 \)

The solution satisfies all conditions. Therefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then use that information to find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

### Step 1: Determine the rate of hose A

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is:
\[ \text{Rate of A} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours

Hose A works alone for the first 2 hours, so the amount of pool filled by hose A in 2 hours is:
\[ \text{Amount filled by A in 2 hours} = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool} \]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining amount of the pool to be filled

Since hose A filled \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pool, the remaining amount of the pool to be filled is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the pool} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B

Hoses A and B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is:
\[ \text{Combined rate of A and B} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} \text{ pool}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 5: Determine the rate of hose B

We know the rate of hose A is \(\frac{1}{8}\) pool per hour. Therefore, the rate of hose B can be found by subtracting the rate of hose A from the combined rate:
\[ \text{Rate of B} = \text{Combined rate of A and B} - \text{Rate of A} \]
\[ \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone

Since the rate of hose B is \(\frac{1}{8}\) pool per hour, it would take hose B:
\[ \text{Time for B to fill the pool alone} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]

The correct choice is A) 8.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: The solution provided contains an error in the calculation of the rate of hose B. Let's go through the problem again to find the correct answer.

### Step 1: Determine the rate of hose A

Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is:
\[ \text{Rate of A} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours

Hose A works alone for the first 2 hours, so the amount of pool filled by hose A in 2 hours is:
\[ \text{Amount filled by A in 2 hours} = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool} \]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining amount of the pool to be filled

Since hose A filled \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pool, the remaining amount of the pool to be filled is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the pool} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B

Hoses A and B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is:
\[ \text{Combined rate of A and B} = \frac{\frac{3}{4} \text{ pool}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 5: Determine the rate of hose B

We know the rate of hose A is \(\frac{1}{8}\) pool per hour. Therefore, the rate of hose B can be found by subtracting the rate of hose A from the combined rate:
\[ \text{Rate of B} = \text{Combined rate of A and B} - \text{Rate of A} \]
\[ \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone

Since the rate of hose B is \(\frac{1}{8}\) pool per hour, it would take hose B:
\[ \text{Time for B to fill the pool alone} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ pool per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

A)30000
B)415000
C)31500
D)50000
E)None of these",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sales the servant must achieve to reach a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees, given his base salary and commission rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Components of the Servant's Income:**
   - **Base Salary:** 1500 Rupees per month.
   - **Commission Rate:** 15% of the monthly sales.

2. **Set Up the Equation for Total Income:**
   - The servant's total income is the sum of his base salary and the commission from sales.
   - Let \( S \) be the total sales in Rupees.
   - Commission from sales = 15% of \( S \) = \( 0.15 \times S \).

3. **Equation for Desired Total Income:**
   - Total income = Base salary + Commission from sales
   - \( 6000 = 1500 + 0.15 \times S \)

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Subtract the base salary from the total income to find the income from commission:
     \[
     6000 - 1500 = 0.15 \times S
     \]
     \[
     4500 = 0.15 \times S
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{4500}{0.15}
     \]
     \[
     S = 30000
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The servant needs to achieve sales of 30,000 Rupees to have a total monthly income of 6000 Rupees.

A)1.5%
B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount. Here's how we can approach it:

### Understanding the Problem:
- The man borrows Rs. 360.
- He repays this amount in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each.
- We need to find the interest rate.

### Plan:
1. Calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months.
2. Determine the total interest paid.
3. Use the simple interest formula to find the interest rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Monthly installment} \times \text{Number of installments} = 31.50 \times 12 = 378
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Interest Paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total interest paid} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Principal} = 378 - 360 = 18
   \]

3. **Use the Simple Interest Formula:**
   The simple interest formula is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the time is 1 year (since the installments are monthly for a year), and we need to find the rate (R).

   Rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:
   \[
   R = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} = \frac{18}{360 \times 1} = \frac{18}{360} = 0.05
   \]

4. **Convert the Rate to a Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Rate as a percentage} = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%

E)45.86%",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to bring the price of a product back to its original value after it has been reduced by 30%.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The original price of the product is considered as 100%.
   - The price is reduced by 30%, so the new price is 70% of the original price.

2. **Determine the Increase Needed:**
   - We need to find out by what percentage the reduced price (70% of the original) should be increased to return to the original price (100%).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the percentage increase needed.
   - The equation to find \( x \) is:
     \[
     70\% \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 100\%
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Convert the percentage to a decimal for calculation:
     \[
     0.7 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 1
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.7:
     \[
     1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\frac{1}{0.7}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{0.7} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.4286
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{x}{100} = 1.4286 - 1 = 0.4286
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 100 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 0.4286 \times 100 = 42.86
     \]

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"PLAN: To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges to choose).

Plug these values into the formula:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2 \times 1 \times 8!}

C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the painting of the 3 houses after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have done their parts. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Determine how much work is done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Determine how much work is done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12:
     \[
     \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12}, \quad \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12}
     \]
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Determine the remaining work to be done by Mr. Blue:**
   - Total work required = 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate how many days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Days required = \( \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{Mr. Blue's rate}} = \frac{\frac{11}{12}}{\frac{1}{12}} = 11 \) days.

C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the hollow cube and determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface is painted.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

1. **Outer Cube Dimensions**: The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm.
2. **Thickness of the Cube**: The thickness of the hollow cube is 1 cm.
3. **Inner Cube Dimensions**: The inner cube, which is hollow, will have a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side).

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Smaller Cubes

1. **Total Number of Smaller Cubes in the Outer Cube**: 
   - The outer cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - Total smaller cubes in the outer cube = \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).

2. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Inner Hollow Part**:
   - The inner hollow part is also made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - Total smaller cubes in the inner hollow part = \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).

3. **Number of Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Cube**:
   - Smaller cubes in the hollow structure = Total cubes in the outer cube - Cubes in the inner hollow part = \(125 - 27 = 98\).

### Step 3: Determine the Number of Unpainted Faces

1. **Total Faces of All Smaller Cubes**:
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - Total faces for all smaller cubes = \(98 \times 6 = 588\).

2. **Painted Faces**:
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted.
   - The outer surface consists of \(5 \times 5 \times 6 = 150\) faces (since each face of the outer cube is \(5 \times 5\) and there are 6 faces).

3. **Unpainted Faces**:
   - Unpainted faces = Total faces of all smaller cubes - Painted faces = \(588 - 150 = 438\).

1. **Identify the total percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - We are given that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates must be vanilla flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

3. **Determine the percentage of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the remaining chocolates (which are vanilla flavored) are squashed.
   - So, 90% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% of 90% = 0.9 * 90% = 81%.

4. **Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - If 81% of the chocolates are squashed vanilla, then the remaining vanilla chocolates are not squashed.

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find a set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. We then need to determine which of the given choices could be one of these numbers.

### Step-by-step Plan:

1. **Define the Consecutive Odd Numbers:**
   Let the first odd number be \( x \). Then the consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as:
   \[
   x, \, x+2, \, x+4, \, x+6, \, x+8
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sum:**
   The sum of these numbers is:
   \[
   S = x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20
   \]

3. **Condition for Perfect Square:**
   We need \( \frac{S}{10} \) to be a perfect square. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}
   \]
   This implies \( \frac{x + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( \frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer.

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 4 = 2n^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2n^2 - 4
   \]

5. **Check for Two-Digit Odd Numbers:**
   Since \( x \) must be a two-digit odd number, we have:
   \[
   10 \leq x \leq 99
   \]
   \[
   10 \leq 2n^2 - 4 \leq 99
   \]
   \[
   14 \leq 2n^2 \leq 103
   \]
   \[
   7 \leq n^2 \leq 51.5
   \]
   Therefore, \( n \) can be an integer from 3 to 7 (since \( n^2 \) must be a perfect square).

6. **Calculate Possible Values of \( x \):**
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( x = 2(3^2) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) (not odd)
   - For \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2(4^2) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \) (not odd)
   - For \( n = 5 \), \( x = 2(5^2) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \) (not odd)
   - For \( n = 6 \), \( x = 2(6^2) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \) (not odd)
   - For \( n = 7 \), \( x = 2(7^2) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \) (odd)

7. **Verify the Set:**
   If \( x = 95 \), the numbers are 95, 97, 99, 101, 103. Their sum is:
   \[
   95 + 97 + 99 + 101 + 103 = 495
   \]
   \[
   \frac{495}{10} = 49 = 7^2

E)1000",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the class based on the given percentages and the number of students not interested in any games. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define the total number of students**: Let the total number of students in the class be \( x \).

2. **Calculate the number of students interested in each game**:
   - **Football**: 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).
   - **Cricket**: \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the total students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).
   - **Basketball**: 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate the number of students not interested in any games**: We are given that 20 students are not interested in any games.

4. **Set up the equation**: The sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:
   \[
   0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal: \(\frac{4}{5} = 0.80\).
   - Substitute into the equation:
     \[
     0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     0.98x + 20 = x
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:
     \[
     20 = x - 0.98x
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     20 = 0.02x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000
     \]

Therefore, the total number of students in the class is 1000. The correct answer is:

61,,"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into mathematical equations and then solve for the desired quantity, which is the difference between the ages of R and Q.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We are given:
1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.
2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years.

We need to find the difference between the ages of R and Q.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan

Let's denote:
- The age of Q as \( q \)
- The age of R as \( r \)
- The age of T as \( t \)

From the problem statement:
1. ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T"" can be translated to:
   \[
   r - q = q - t
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   r + t = 2q
   \]

2. We are also given:
   \[
   r + t = 50
   \]

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan

From the two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

We can equate the right-hand sides of these equations:
\[
2q = 50
\]

Solving for \( q \):
\[
q = 25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the ages of R and Q, which is \( r - q \).

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[
r + t = 50 = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

This confirms our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[
r - 25 = 25 - t
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
r = 50 - t
\]

Substituting \( r = 50 - t \) into \( r - q = q - t \):
\[
(50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t
\]

Simplifying:
\[
25 - t = 25 - t
\]

This equation is always true, which means the specific values of \( r \) and \( t \) are not needed to determine the difference \( r - q \).

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r - q = q - t \), we can conclude:
\[
r - q = 25 - t
\]

Thus, the difference between R and Q's age is:
\[
r - q = 25 - t
\]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
t = 50 - r
\]

Substituting back:
\[
r - q = 25 - (50 - r)
\]
\[
r - q = 2r - 50 + 25
\]
\[
r - q = 2r - 25
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
r - q = 25
\]

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is definitely 25 years.

### Step 4: Conclusion

The difference between R and Q's age is 25 years. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. Therefore, the correct answer is:

```
E) None of the above
```
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: The solution you provided is correct in terms of the logical steps and calculations, but there seems to be a small oversight in the final conclusion. Let's go through the problem again to ensure clarity:

1. We have the equation \( r - q = q - t \), which simplifies to \( r + t = 2q \).
2. We are also given \( r + t = 50 \).

From these two equations, we equate the right-hand sides:

\[
2q = 50
\]

Solving for \( q \):

\[
q = 25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the ages of R and Q, which is \( r - q \).

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r + t = 2q \), we have:

\[
r + t = 50 = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

This confirms our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):

\[
r - 25 = 25 - t
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
r = 50 - t
\]

Substituting back into \( r - q = q - t \):

\[
r - 25 = 25 - t
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
r - q = 25 - t
\]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) in terms of \( r \):

\[
t = 50 - r
\]

Substituting back:

\[
r - q = 25 - (50 - r)
\]

\[
r - q = 2r - 50 + 25
\]

\[
r - q = 2r - 25
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
r - q = 25
\]

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is definitely 25 years. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. Therefore, the correct answer is:

```
E) None of the above

A)11.75 miles
B)12.75 miles
C)17.75 miles
D)14.75 miles
E)10.75 miles",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how far you can travel with $8.50 given the cab's pricing structure. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Pricing Structure:**
   - The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Money After the Initial Charge:**
   - You start with $8.50.
   - Subtract the cost of the first quarter-mile: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.

3. **Determine How Many Additional Quarter-Miles You Can Afford:**
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10.
   - With $5.00 remaining, calculate the number of additional quarter-miles: $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

4. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The first quarter-mile is already covered by the initial $3.50.
   - You can afford 50 additional quarter-miles.
   - Total quarter-miles = 1 (initial) + 50 (additional) = 51 quarter-miles.

5. **Convert Quarter-Miles to Miles:**
   - There are 4 quarter-miles in a mile.
   - Total miles = 51 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.75 miles.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Sachin's batting average, the number of matches he has played, and the runs he has scored.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Current batting average = 51
   - Runs scored in the finals = 78
   - New batting average after the finals = 54

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( n \) be the total number of matches played before the finals.
   - Let \( R \) be the total runs scored before the finals.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The current batting average is given by:
     \[
     \frac{R}{n} = 51
     \]
     Therefore, \( R = 51n \).

   - After scoring 78 runs in the finals, the total runs become \( R + 78 \), and the total number of matches becomes \( n + 1 \).

   - The new batting average is given by:
     \[
     \frac{R + 78}{n + 1} = 54
     \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( R = 51n \) into the new batting average equation:
     \[
     \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54
     \]

   - Multiply both sides by \( n + 1 \) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)
     \]

   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     51n + 78 = 54n + 54
     \]

   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     78 - 54 = 54n - 51n
     \]
     \[
     24 = 3n
     \]
     \[
     n = 8

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
A)3
B)4
C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, meaning that a pair like ""AB"" is the same as ""BA"".

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use \( n \) different letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: For pairs of letters, the number of unique combinations is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 letters from \( n \) without regard to order.

We need the total number of unique codes (single letters + pairs) to be at least 10. Therefore, we need:

\[ n + \binom{n}{2} \geq 10 \]

Let's evaluate this for different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3 (A, B, C)
  - Pair codes: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\) (AB, AC, BC)
  - Total codes: \(3 + 3 = 6\)

  This is not enough.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 4 (A, B, C, D)
  - Pair codes: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD)
  - Total codes: \(4 + 6 = 10\)

  This is exactly what we need.

Thus, with 4 letters, we can create exactly 10 unique codes, which is sufficient for the 10 different types of books.

Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 4.

65,,"A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of a rectangle given its area and a relationship between its length and breadth.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We have a rectangle with an area of 150 square meters.
- The length (L) of the rectangle is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth (B).
- We need to find the perimeter of the rectangle.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations
1. **Area Equation**:  
   \[
   L \times B = 150
   \]

2. **Length-Breadth Relationship**:  
   \[
   L = 4B + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve
Substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(4B + 1) \times B = 150
\]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[
4B^2 + B = 150
\]

Rearrange the equation:

\[
4B^2 + B - 150 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

### Step 4: Solve the Quadratic Equation
Use the quadratic formula:

\[
B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
B = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150)}}{2 \times 4}
\]

\[
B = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8}
\]

\[
B = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8}
\]

\[
B = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \( B \):

1. \( B = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( B = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative)

Thus, \( B = 6 \).

### Step 5: Find the Length
Substitute \( B = 6 \) back into the length equation:

\[
L = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2(L + B)
\]

Substitute the values of \( L \) and \( B \):

\[
P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62
\]

### Conclusion
The perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement for vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin A, we need:
     \[
     \frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Requirement:**
   - To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated above, because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
- We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Needed
- **Large Cakes:** We need 20 large cakes. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, the total hours needed for large cakes is:
  \[
  \text{Hours for large cakes} = \frac{20 \text{ large cakes}}{2 \text{ large cakes/hr}} = 10 \text{ hours}

- Let \( P \) be the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- Let \( R \) be the amount of falafel in one roll.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of falafel in one baguette.

Now, let's translate the given information into equations:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   3P = R
   \]

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B
   \]

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Let's express \( B \) in terms of \( P \) using the equations we have:

From \( 3P = R \), we can express \( R \) in terms of \( P \):
\[
R = 3P
\]

Substitute \( R = 3P \) into the second equation \( 3R = 5B \):
\[
3(3P) = 5B
\]
\[
9P = 5B

Now, we want to find how many pita breads (in terms of \( P \)) are equivalent to two baguettes (in terms of \( B \)):
\[
2B = xP

Substitute \( B = \frac{9P}{5} \) into the equation:
\[
2\left(\frac{9P}{5}\right) = xP

\[
\frac{18P}{5} = xP

Divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):

We have the following relationships:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B
   \]

We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.

First, express \( R \) in terms of \( P \):
\[
R = 3P
\]

Substitute \( R = 3P \) into the second equation:
\[
3(3P) = 5B \implies 9P = 5B
\]

Now, express \( B \) in terms of \( P \):
\[
B = \frac{9P}{5}
\]

We want to find how many pita breads (\( xP \)) are equivalent to two baguettes (\( 2B \)):
\[
2B = xP
\]

Substitute \( B = \frac{9P}{5} \) into the equation:
\[
2\left(\frac{9P}{5}\right) = xP \implies \frac{18P}{5} = xP

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

### Understanding the Problem:
1. **Discount Given**: 20% off on all items.
2. **Objective**: Find the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after the discount.

### Plan:
1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let the original price of an item be \( P \).
   - The discounted price after a 20% discount is \( P - 0.2P = 0.8P \).

2. **Calculate the Required Increase**:
   - To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.8P \), we need to find the percentage increase from \( 0.8P \) to \( P \).

3. **Percentage Increase Formula**:
   - The formula for percentage increase is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - Here, the new price is \( P \) and the old price is \( 0.8P \).

### Execution:
1. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = P - 0.8P = 0.2P
   \]

2. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.2P}{0.8P} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.2}{0.8} \right) \times 100\% = 0.25 \times 100\% = 25\%

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The ship travels 180 miles before the plane starts.
   - The plane travels at a speed 10 times that of the ship.
   - We need to find the total distance from the starting point when they meet.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let the speed of the ship be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - The plane's speed is \( 10S \) miles per hour.
   - Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.

A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. The idea is that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample should be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

Here's how we can solve it step by step:

1. **Identify the Proportion in the Sample:**
   - In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them had tags.
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is \( \frac{20}{500} = \frac{1}{25} \).

2. **Set Up the Proportion for the Entire Population:**
   - Let \( N \) be the total deer population in the forest.
   - Since 300 deer were tagged in 2001, the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is \( \frac{300}{N} \).

3. **Equate the Two Proportions:**
   - Since the sample proportion is representative of the entire population, we set the two proportions equal:
   \[
   \frac{300}{N} = \frac{1}{25}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( N \):
   \[
   300 \times 25 = N

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
A)0.9
B)0.8
C)0.6
D)0.65
E)1.5",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. Let's break down the situation:

1. **Train Schedules:**
   - The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M. (i.e., 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, etc.).
   - The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M. (i.e., 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.).

2. **Time Intervals:**
   - The main line train arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, etc.
   - The harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.

3. **Time Windows:**
   - From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:12 to 5:20, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - This pattern repeats every 10 minutes.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - In each 10-minute cycle, the main line train is the first to arrive for 2 minutes (5:00-5:02 and 5:10-5:12).
   - The harbor line train is the first to arrive for 8 minutes (5:02-5:10 and 5:12-5:20).

5. **Probability:**
   - The probability of catching the main line train first is the ratio of the time it is the first to arrive to the total cycle time.
   - Probability = (Time main line is first) / (Total cycle time) = 2/10 = 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (main line train) is 0.2.

However, the problem asks for the probability of catching the first train that comes, which includes both trains. Since the man will catch whichever train comes first, the probability of catching the first train is actually 1 (since he will always catch the first train that arrives, whether it's the main line or the harbor line).

Given the choices, none of them directly match this interpretation, but if we consider the probability of catching the main line train specifically, the answer would be 0.2, which is not listed. However, the problem seems to be asking for the probability of catching any first train, which is 1.

E)44.8",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the heavy-duty truck that was added to the group of vehicles. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Information:**
   - The average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons.
   - Therefore, the total weight of these 10 vehicles is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of 10 vehicles} = 10 \times 12.2 = 122 \text{ tons}

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the population of Boomtown one year ago.
   - According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.

2. **Population Growth:**
   - The population now (current year) is \( P \times (1 + 0.10) = 1.1P \).
   - The population one year from now will be \( 1.1P \times 1.1 = 1.21P \).

A)62, 35
B)62, 34
C)34, 62
D)42, 62
E)62, 42",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve those equations to find out how much money Arjun and Sajal each have.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the amount of money Arjun has.
- \( S \) as the amount of money Sajal has.

According to the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   - After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
   - Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).
   - The equation becomes: 
     \[
     S + 30 = 2(A - 30)

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   - After giving $10, Sajal will have \( S - 10 \).
   - Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
     \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

### Equation 1:
\[
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
\]
\[
S + 30 = 2A - 60
\]
\[
S = 2A - 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

### Equation 2:
\[
A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
\]
\[
A + 10 = 3S - 30
\]
\[
A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

Substitute \( S = 2A - 90 \) into \( A = 3S - 40 \):
\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40

\[
A = 6A - 310
\]
\[
310 = 6A - A

\[
310 = 5A

\[
A = 62

Now, substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):
\[
S = 2(62) - 90

\[
S = 124 - 90

\[
S = 34

   - We know the area and the width, so we can solve for the length.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the known values into the area formula:
     \[
     3,000 = \text{Length} \times 100

83,,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \) feet.
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) feet by \( (s - 4) \) feet.
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.
   - Use the area of the triangle to find the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - Calculate the perimeter of the original square.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For one of the triangles, the base and height are \( s \) and \( (s - 4) \).
   - Therefore, the area of one triangle is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( s \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times (s^2 - 4s) = 70
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]
   - Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
     where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
     \[
     s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     \[
     s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

4. **Find the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

84,,"The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now?
A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means for the length of the ribbon to be reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the original length of the ribbon is divided into two parts in the ratio 5:3, and the new length is the smaller part of this division.

Let's break down the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that the original length is divided into two parts where the first part is 5 units and the second part is 3 units. The total number of parts is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

2. **Calculate the Length of One Part**: Since the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, we divide this length by the total number of parts (8) to find the length of one part.
   \[
   \text{Length of one part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Calculate the New Length**: The new length of the ribbon corresponds to the smaller part of the ratio, which is 3 parts. Therefore, we multiply the length of one part by 3.
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation or interpretation because 11.25 cm is not one of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Upon re-evaluation, the new length should be calculated as follows:

- The original length is reduced to the smaller part of the ratio, which is 3 parts out of the total 8 parts.
- Therefore, the new length is:
  \[
  \text{New length} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cm} = 18 \text{ cm}

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"PLAN: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Expressing \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substituting into the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a + 297c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a = 990 - 297c
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{990 - 297c}{99}
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{990}{99} - \frac{297c}{99}
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 - 3c
   \]

6. **Finding Valid Values for \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) is a digit (0 to 9), and \( c \) is also a digit (0 to 9), we need to find valid integer values for \( a \) and \( c \) such that \( a = 10 - 3c \) is a valid digit.

7. **Checking Possible Values of \( c \):**
   - \( c = 0 \): \( a = 10 - 3 \times 0 = 10 \) (not valid since \( a \) must be a digit)
   - \( c = 1 \): \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \) (valid)
   - \( c = 2 \): \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \) (valid)
   - \( c = 3 \): \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \) (valid)
   - \( c = 4 \): \( a = 10 - 3 \times 4 = -2 \) (not valid)

   Therefore, the valid pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

8. **Calculating \( M \) for Each Valid Pair:**
   - For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\): \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
   - For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\): \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
   - For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\): \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)

9. **Finding Values of \( M > 300 \):**
   - For \( M = 701 + 10b \), all values are greater than 300.
   - For \( M = 402 + 10b \), all values are greater than 300.
   - For \( M = 103 + 10b \), only values where \( 10b \geq 200 \) are greater than 300, which means \( b \geq 20 \) (not possible since \( b \) is a digit).

10. **Counting the Values:**
    - For \( M = 701 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
    - For \( M = 402 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
    - For \( M = 103 + 10b \), no valid values of \( b \) make \( M > 300 \).

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are greater than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the least possible number of students in the school given the percentages of students who took only physics and only math. We know:

- 20% of the students took only physics.
- 28% of the students took only math.
- The total number of students is more than 501.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \).

1. **Calculate the number of students who took only physics and only math:**

   - Students who took only physics: \( 0.20 \times N \)
   - Students who took only math: \( 0.28 \times N \)

2. **Since these are percentages of the total number of students, the sum of these percentages must be less than or equal to 100%:**

   \[
   0.20N + 0.28N \leq N
   \]

   Simplifying, we get:

   \[
   0.48N \leq N
   \]

   This inequality is always true, so it doesn't provide additional constraints.

3. **Determine the least possible number of students:**

   Since the total number of students must be more than 501, we need to find the smallest \( N \) that satisfies this condition and is a whole number.

   - Check the given choices to find the smallest \( N \) that is greater than 501.

   - Calculate the number of students for each choice to ensure they are whole numbers:

       - \( 0.20 \times 550 = 110 \) (whole number)
       - \( 0.28 \times 550 = 154 \) (whole number)

     - For \( N = 570 \):
       - \( 0.20 \times 570 = 114 \) (whole number)
       - \( 0.28 \times 570 = 159.6 \) (not a whole number)

     - For \( N = 600 \):
       - \( 0.20 \times 600 = 120 \) (whole number)
       - \( 0.28 \times 600 = 168 \) (whole number)

     - For \( N = 700 \):
       - \( 0.20 \times 700 = 140 \) (whole number)
       - \( 0.28 \times 700 = 196 \) (whole number)

4. **Conclusion:**

   The smallest \( N \) that satisfies all conditions and results in whole numbers for both percentages is 550. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age and their age relationship 5 years ago.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( R \) be Rahim's current age.
   - 5 years ago, Raj's age was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \).
   - 5 years ago, Rahim's age was \( R - 5 \).
   - According to the problem, 5 years ago, Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{3}(R - 5)
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     36 = R - 5
     \]
   - Add 5 to both sides to solve for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 36 + 5 = 41

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area at a rate of 10 square feet per day.

### Step 1: Determine the Grazing Area

The cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14-foot long rope. This means the cow can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[
A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
\]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[
A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544
\]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

### Conclusion

The cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the entire field. However, since the choices provided do not include 62, we should consider the closest option, which is:

**B) 61 days**

### Step 1: Determine the Cost Price

1. **Initial Sale Information:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Rs 27.50
   - Profit Percentage = 10%

2. **Formula for Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Cost Price (CP)}
   \]

3. **Relation between SP, CP, and Profit:**
   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit}
   \]

4. **Substitute the values:**
   \[
   27.50 = \text{CP} + \left(\frac{10}{100} \times \text{CP}\right)
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   27.50 = \text{CP} \times \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right)
   \]
   \[
   27.50 = \text{CP} \times 1.10
   \]

6. **Solve for CP:**
   \[
   \text{CP} = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit or Loss at Rs 25.75

1. **New Selling Price (SP') = Rs 25.75**

2. **Determine Profit or Loss:**
   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{SP'} - \text{CP} = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75

E)6",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children, Susan, Tim, and Zen, on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan is always to the left of Tim.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is given by the factorial of 3:

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6

These arrangements are:

2. Susan, Zen, Tim
3. Tim, Susan, Zen
4. Tim, Zen, Susan

6. Zen, Tim, Susan

Next, we apply the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan and Tim, there are two possibilities: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan. Since these two possibilities are equally likely, exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim.

Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. The bill is composed of a fixed part and a variable part that depends on the number of calls made. Let's denote:

- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.
- \( C \) as the number of calls made.

The total bill \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = F + V \times C \]

We have two scenarios given in the problem:

1. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[ 1800 = F + 540V \]

2. When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[ 2040 = F + 620V \]

We have two equations with two unknowns (F and V). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( F \) and \( V \).

**Step 1: Solve the equations**

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):
\[ (2040 - 1800) = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) \]
\[ 240 = 80V \]
\[ V = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[ 1800 = F + 540 \times 3 \]
\[ 1800 = F + 1620 \]
\[ F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the bill for 500 calls**

Now that we know \( F = 180 \) and \( V = 3 \), we can calculate the bill for 500 calls:
\[ B = F + V \times C \]
\[ B = 180 + 3 \times 500 \]
\[ B = 180 + 1500 \]
\[ B = 1680 \]

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the time for one full rotation for each ball:**

   - **Ball A:** 
     - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
     - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball A is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.

   - **Ball B:** 
     - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
     - Therefore, the time for 1 full rotation for Ball B is \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

2. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**

   - We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes.

   - Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 
     \[
     \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the LCM into hours and minutes:**

   - 91 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes = 1 hour).

Therefore, both balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A)10
B)15
C)18
D)20
E)30",D,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction. We are given the following information:

- Total number of books: 45
- Number of hardcover books: 30
- Number of fiction books: 20

We want to find the maximum overlap between the hardcover books and the fiction books. This is essentially finding the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction.

To find this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of books that are either hardcover or fiction (or both) is:

\[
|H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F|
\]

Where:
- \(|H \cup F|\) is the total number of books that are either hardcover or fiction (or both).
- \(|H|\) is the number of hardcover books.
- \(|F|\) is the number of fiction books.
- \(|H \cap F|\) is the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

We know:
- \(|H \cup F| \leq 45\) (since there are only 45 books in total)
- \(|H| = 30\)
- \(|F| = 20\)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
|H \cup F| = 30 + 20 - |H \cap F|
\]

Since \(|H \cup F| \leq 45\), we have:

\[
30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45
\]

Simplifying this inequality:

\[
50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45
\]

\[
|H \cap F| \geq 50 - 45
\]

\[
|H \cap F| \geq 5
\]

However, we are looking for the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction. To find the maximum, we consider the constraints:

- The maximum number of hardcover books is 30.
- The maximum number of fiction books is 20.

The maximum overlap occurs when all fiction books are hardcover. Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is the smaller of the two numbers, which is 20.

Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, given the cost structure and the total weekly expenditure on newspapers.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys each day from Monday to Saturday.
   - Since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

2. **Calculate the Cost:**
   - From Monday to Saturday, the cost per newspaper is $1. Therefore, the cost for these six days is \( 6x \times 1 = 6x \).
   - On Sunday, the cost per newspaper is $4. Therefore, the cost for Sunday is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total weekly cost is given as $210. So, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     6x + 8x = 210
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     14x = 210
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 14 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{210}{14} = 15
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The hotel buys 15 newspapers on each day from Monday to Saturday.

Therefore, the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday is \( \boxed{15} \).

The correct answer is choice A) 15.

95,,"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many friends actually attended the picnic. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Initial Plan**: A group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables.
2. **Change in Plan**: Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to pay Rs. 4 extra each.
3. **Objective**: Find out how many friends actually attended the picnic.

### Plan to Solve the Problem

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of friends who initially planned to attend the picnic.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of friends who actually attended the picnic.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - Initially, each friend would contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).
   - After 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended is \( y = x - 4 \).
   - The new contribution per friend is \( \frac{96}{y} \).
   - According to the problem, the new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the initial contribution: 
     \[
     \frac{96}{y} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation**:
   - Substitute \( y = x - 4 \) into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
     \]
   - Clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):
     \[
     96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
     \]
     \[
     0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Use the quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -96 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant: 
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-96) = 16 + 384 = 400
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
     \]
     - Possible solutions: \( x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) or \( x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8 \)

5. **Select the Valid Solution**:
   - Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

6. **Determine the Number of Friends Who Attended**:
   - Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended is \( y = x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

### Conclusion

The number of friends who attended the picnic is \( \boxed{8} \).

96,,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a wire initially shaped as a rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm.
   - This wire is then reshaped into a square.
   - We need to find the length of each side of the square.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - First, calculate the perimeter of the original rectangle. This will give us the total length of the wire.
   - Since the wire is reshaped into a square, the perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle.
   - Use the perimeter of the square to find the length of each side of the square.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter of rectangle} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - The perimeter of the square is also 88 cm.
   - Let \( s \) be the length of each side of the square. The perimeter of a square is given by \( 4s \).
   - Set up the equation:
     \[
     4s = 88
     \]
   - Solve for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{88}{4} = 22
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of each side of the square is 22 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 22**.

A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"PLAN: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each daughter receives based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the amount each nephew receives be \( x \).

2. **Express Other Amounts in Terms of \( x \):**
   - Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
   - Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - There are 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.
   - The total amount distributed is Rs 8600.
   - The equation based on the distribution is:
     \[
     5 \times 5x + 4 \times 4x + 2 \times x = 8600
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Calculate the total amount in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     43x = 8600
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 43 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
     \]

6. **Calculate the Amount Each Daughter Receives:**
   - Each daughter receives \( 4x \):
     \[
     4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
     \]

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"PLAN: To solve the problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information she provided. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### Understanding the Problem:
1. Silu weighs 51 kg.
2. Meenu says she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.

### Plan:
Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( M \).

According to Meenu's statement:
\[ M = 29 + \frac{1}{2}M \]

We need to solve this equation to find the value of \( M \).

### Solving the Equation:
1. Start with the equation:
   \[ M = 29 + \frac{1}{2}M \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, subtract \(\frac{1}{2}M\) from both sides:
   \[ M - \frac{1}{2}M = 29 \]

3. Simplify the left side:
   \[ \frac{1}{2}M = 29 \]

4. To solve for \( M \), multiply both sides by 2:
   \[ M = 58 \]

### Conclusion:
Meenu weighs 58 kg. Therefore, the correct choice is:
