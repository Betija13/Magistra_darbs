64,,"A train covers a distance of 10km in 10 min. If it takes 6 sec to pass a telegraph post, then the length of the train is?",C,"A
------
To calculate the length of the train, we first need to determine its speed.

1. The distance covered by the train is 10 km in 10 minutes.
2. Convert 10 km to meters: 
   \[
   10 \text{ km} = 10,000 \text{ m}
   \]
3. Convert 10 minutes to seconds: 
   \[
   10 \text{ min} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ seconds}
   \]
4. Calculate the speed of the train in m/s: 
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{10,000 \text{ m}}{600 \text{ s}} \approx 16.67 \text{ m/s}
   \]
5. The train passes a telegraph post in 6 seconds, so we can calculate the length of the train as follows:
   \[
   \text{Length of the train} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 16.67 \text{ m/s} \times 6 \text{ s} \approx 100 \text{ m}
   \]

Now, from the options provided, if the length of the train is approximately 100 meters, we should select the correct answer. Assuming that one of the options corresponds to 100 meters, we can denote it as (D) since it is a common format for such problems.

Thus, the correct answer is:
