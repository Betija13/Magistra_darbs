The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote:

- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Using the tangent function for the angles of elevation:

1. When the angle is 45°:
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
   \]

2. When the angle is 60°:
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. Therefore, the distance covered in 10 minutes is:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[
v = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{10} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \)).

The time \( t \) is given by:
\[
t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 15 + 5\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 15 + 5\sqrt{3} \) minutes.

A)$61
B)$65

The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
\[
x - 0.22x = 0.78x
\]

The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price the customer pays is:
\[
0.78x - 20
\]

According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price:
\[
0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
\]

Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
2(0.78x - 20) = 2\left(\frac{x}{2} + 1.90\right)

The probability that Stock A will not increase is:
\[ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \]

The probability that Stock B will not increase is:
\[ 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \]

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so:

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and returned to the bag. When 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, 1 of them was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is the same as the percentage of black marbles in the sample of 20 marbles.

The percentage of black marbles in the sample is:
\[
\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%
\]

This implies that 5% of the marbles in the bag are black. Since there are 20 black marbles in the bag, we can set up the equation:
\[
0.05 \times Q = 20

Solving for \( Q \), we divide both sides by 0.05:

     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}

  \[
  0.45 \times 200 = 90 \text{ students}

To find the maximum number of students who did neither, we need to minimize the overlap between the two groups. The minimum overlap occurs when the total number of students who attended either event is maximized.

The total number of students who attended at least one event is:
\[
\text{Prom attendees} + \text{Debate participants} - \text{Overlap} = 90 + 70 - \text{Overlap}

Since the maximum number of students who attended at least one event is 200, the overlap should be minimized. The minimum overlap is 0, which means:
\[

E)None of the above",D,"To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number sold last year is:
     \[
     42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens}

Let's break down the information given:

1. The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x

First, let's calculate the profit made on each bag:

1. The selling price of each bag is $100.
2. The profit percentage is 25% of the selling price.
3. Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:
   \[
   \text{Profit per bag} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

1. **Math Students**: \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math, so \( N \) must be divisible by 16.
2. **Bio Students**: \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, so \( N \) must be divisible by 10.
3. **English Students**: \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English, so \( N \) must be divisible by 8.

To find the least common multiple (LCM) of these divisors (16, 10, and 8), we calculate:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Now, we need to find the minimum and maximum 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

- The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. Dividing 1000 by 80 gives 12.5, so the smallest multiple of 80 greater than or equal to 1000 is \( 80 \times 13 = 1040 \).

   - The perimeter of this folded rectangle is given as 48 cm.
   - The perimeter formula for a rectangle is \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48

   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

   - When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the resulting folded rectangle has dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of this folded rectangle is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[

2l + w &= 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

To solve for \( l \) and \( w \), we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

- Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
  \[
  2l + 4w = 96

- Subtract Equation 2 from this result:
  \[
  (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66

  \[
  2l = 56

  \[
  l = 28

Now that we have \( l = 28 \) and \( w = 10 \), we can find the area of the original sheet:

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The correct area should be calculated as:

Upon reviewing the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the folding and perimeter calculation. Let's re-evaluate the folding and perimeter:

- Correct the folding and perimeter understanding:
  - When folded along the length, the perimeter is 48 cm, which means:

  - When folded along the width, the perimeter is 66 cm, which means:
    \[

1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **First Movement**: A travels 3 km south. This means A moves from (0, 0) to (0, -3).

3. **Second Movement**: A travels 5 km east. This means A moves from (0, -3) to (5, -3).

Let's assume the side of the square is \(d\) km.

1. **Total Distance:**
   Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance traveled is the perimeter of the square, which is \(4d\).

2. **Total Time:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr: \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours

   Total time taken = \(\frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}\)

   To simplify, find a common denominator, which is 2400:

   \[

D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

\[ b(x + y) + x = 100 \]

Since \( x + y = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:

\[ b(18) + x = 100 \]

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( 18b + x = 100 \)

From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 18 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 18 - x \) into the second equation:

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into \( y = 18 - x \):

\[ y = 18 - (100 - 18b) \]

\[ y = 18 - 100 + 18b \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) such that both are non-negative and satisfy the equation \( x + y = 18 \).

Let's test the given choices:

A) \( x = 10, y = 8 \)

Check if this satisfies the equation:

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12.
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to \( \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The total contract is for 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = 3 - \( \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( \frac{36}{12} \).

D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Determine the total number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.

2. **Determine the number of smaller cubes in the hollow part:**
   - The hollow part is a cube with a side length of 3 cm (since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner cube is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm).
   - The inner cube contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Determine the number of smaller cubes that form the shell:**
   - The shell is the outer cube minus the inner cube, so it contains \(125 - 27 = 98\) smaller cubes.

4. **Determine the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The inner cubes (27 of them) are completely unpainted, contributing \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces.
   - The shell cubes (98 of them) have some faces painted. Each shell cube has at least one face painted, but we need to find how many faces remain unpainted.

5. **Calculate the unpainted faces of the shell cubes:**
   - Each shell cube has 6 faces, and since the outer surface is painted, each shell cube will have at least one face painted.
   - However, the cubes on the edges and corners will have more than one face painted.
   - To simplify, we calculate the total number of faces of all cubes and subtract the painted faces.

6. **Calculate the total number of faces:**
   - Total faces of all 125 cubes: \(125 \times 6 = 750\).

7. **Calculate the painted faces:**
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted, which consists of 6 faces, each \(5 \times 5 = 25\) smaller cubes, so \(6 \times 25 = 150\) faces are painted.

8. **Calculate the unpainted faces:**
   - Total unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = \(750 - 150 = 600\).

9. **Subtract the unpainted faces of the inner cubes:**
   - We already calculated that the inner 27 cubes have 162 unpainted faces.

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20

We are given that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we need:
\[
\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}

to be a perfect square.

Let \(\frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2\) for some integer \(k\). Then:
\[
n + 4 = 2k^2

\[
n = 2k^2 - 4

\[
7 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5

The integer values for \(k^2\) within this range are \(9, 16, 25, 36, 49\).

Calculating \(n\) for these values:
- If \(k^2 = 9\), then \(n = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 16\), then \(n = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 25\), then \(n = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 36\), then \(n = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 49\), then \(n = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94\) (odd)

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:
\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

From these equations, we can equate the right-hand sides:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we don't need to substitute further. However, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

We already know \( r + t = 50 \), so we can solve for \( r - q \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can substitute \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means the difference \( r - q \) is consistent with the given conditions. However, we need to find a specific numerical value for \( r - q \).

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( r - q = q - t \), we can solve for \( r - q \) using:
\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Substituting \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation is consistent, but it doesn't provide a specific numerical value for \( r - q \) without additional information. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined from the given information.

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth does not make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The dimensions of the rectangle are 6 meters by 25 meters.

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need:

A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of large cakes and small cakes that need to be made:

- Large cakes: 20
- Small cakes: 700

Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

Let's calculate the total number of cakes that one helper can make in 3 hours:

- Large cakes: 2 cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- Small cakes: 35 cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes

Now, let's determine how many helpers are needed for each type of cake:

1. **Large cakes:**

   We need 20 large cakes, and each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours.

   Number of helpers needed for large cakes = 20 large cakes / 6 large cakes per helper = 3.33 helpers

   Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 helpers.

2. **Small cakes:**

   We need 700 small cakes, and each helper can make 105 small cakes in 3 hours.

   Number of helpers needed for small cakes = 700 small cakes / 105 small cakes per helper = 6.67 helpers

   Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 7 helpers.

Finally, we need to combine the helpers required for both tasks. Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we take the maximum of the two numbers:

- Maximum helpers needed = max(4, 7) = 7 helpers

However, we must ensure that the total number of helpers can cover both tasks. Since 7 helpers can make 42 large cakes (7 * 6) and 735 small cakes (7 * 105), they can indeed cover both requirements (20 large cakes and 700 small cakes).

Therefore, the number of helpers required is 7, but since the choices provided do not include 7, we must have made an error in our calculation or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate:

Upon re-evaluation, it seems there was a miscalculation in the interpretation of the problem. Let's try a different approach:

- Total large cake hours needed = 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes per hour = 10 hours
- Total small cake hours needed = 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours

Total hours needed = 10 hours (for large cakes) + 20 hours (for small cakes) = 30 hours

Since each helper works for 3 hours, the number of helpers required = 30 hours / 3 hours per helper = 10 helpers.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST. Therefore, SU = ST / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

Now, we need to find RU. We know that RT = RS + ST, so:

RT = RS + ST
17 = 5 + 22

This confirms the given lengths are consistent. Now, since U is the midpoint of ST, we can express RU as:

RU = RT - TU

2. **Roll to Baguette Relationship:**
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

3. **Baguette to Pita Relationship:**
   - We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.

Let's express everything in terms of pita breads:

- From the first relationship, 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
- From the second relationship, 1 roll = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

Equating the two expressions for 1 roll:
\[ 3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ baguettes} \]

To find the number of pita breads equivalent to 1 baguette, divide both sides by \( \frac{5}{3} \):
\[ 1 \text{ baguette} = \frac{3}{5} \times 3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{9}{5} \text{ pita breads} \]

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population two years from now can be expressed as:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that this future population is exactly double the population of one year ago:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

To find the population increase over the last year, we need to determine the population one year ago compared to the current population. Let the current population be \( P_{\text{current}} \).

The relationship between the current population and the population one year ago is:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times (1 + x) \]

where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year expressed as a decimal.

Since the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago, we have:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

This implies that the current population is:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.21 \]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P_{\text{current}} \):

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times (1 + x) \]

Since \( P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.21 \), we have:

\[ P \times (1 + x) = P \times 1.21 \]

Dividing both sides by \( P \):

Thus, the percent increase over the last year is 21%.

However, the closest choice to 21% is not listed. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure accuracy.

The problem states that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago, not the current population.

The current population is:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.21 \]

The percent increase from one year ago to the current population is:

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation:

1. We have a square piece of cloth with side length \( s \).
2. One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet, making it a rectangle with dimensions \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).
3. This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = s \times (s - 4)
\]

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the total area of the rectangle is:
\[
2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, we have the equation:
\[
s \times (s - 4) = 140
\]

Expanding and rearranging gives:
\[
s^2 - 4s = 140
\]

Rearranging further, we have:
\[
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}

This gives two possible solutions for \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10

Since a side length cannot be negative, we have \( s = 14 \).

The perimeter of the original square cloth is:
\[
4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ feet}

Thus, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

E)12",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we need to express the numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of the digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

The condition \( M > N \) implies:
\[ 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a \]

Simplifying this inequality:
\[ 100a + c > 100c + a \]
\[ 99a > 99c \]
\[ a > c \]

We are also given:
\[ M - N + 396c = 990 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( M \) and \( N \):
\[ (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a + 396c = 990 \]
\[ 99a - 99c + 396c = 990 \]
\[ 99a + 297c = 990 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 99:
\[ a + 3c = 10 \]

Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0-9), and \( a > c \), we can find possible values for \( a \) and \( c \).

Let's consider the possible values for \( c \):
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( a + 3(1) = 10 \) implies \( a = 7 \).
- If \( c = 2 \), then \( a + 3(2) = 10 \) implies \( a = 4 \).
- If \( c = 3 \), then \( a + 3(3) = 10 \) implies \( a = 1 \).

Since \( a > c \), the valid pairs \((a, c)\) are:
- \( (7, 1) \)
- \( (4, 2) \)

Now, we calculate the values of \( M \) for each pair:
1. For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \):
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 700 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
   - Since \( M > 300 \), \( 701 + 10b > 300 \) is always true for any \( b \).

2. For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \):
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c = 400 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
   - Since \( M > 300 \), \( 402 + 10b > 300 \) is always true for any \( b \).

For each pair, \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible values for each pair.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is:
\[ 10 \text{ (for } (7, 1) \text{) } + 10 \text{ (for } (4, 2) \text{) } = 20 \]

According to the problem:
- 20% of the students took only physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took only math: \( 0.28N \)

Since these percentages represent students who took only one subject, they do not overlap. Therefore, the sum of these percentages should be less than or equal to 100% of the students.

2. **Set up the equation for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze, which is determined by the length of the rope. The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so it can graze in a circular area with a radius equal to the length of the rope.

The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius \( r \) is 14 feet.

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (14)^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ \text{Area} \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

We know the selling price is Rs 27.50, so:
\[ 1.10C = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

The selling price in this case is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240

\[
F + 1620 = 1800

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

E)25",A,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.

If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The new contribution per person is \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, this new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} - \frac{96}{x} = 4
\]

To solve this, find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96(x - 4)}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{96x - 96x + 384}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

\[
\frac{384}{x(x - 4)} = 4

Multiply both sides by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
384 = 4x(x - 4)

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
96 = x(x - 4)

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}

A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

The total amount distributed is Rs 8600, and it is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.

The total amount distributed can be expressed as:
\[
5 \times 5x + 4 \times 4x + 2 \times x = 8600

Simplifying the equation:
\[
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200

A)18
B)20
C)25
D)26
E)27",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an arithmetic progression (A.P.).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.).
   - The common difference is 3 months, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a year.
   - The youngest member is 7 years old.
   - The sum of the ages of all members is 250 years.

2. **Formulating the A.P.:**
   - Let the number of members be \( n \).
   - The age of the youngest member (first term, \( a \)) is 7 years.
   - The common difference \( d \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \) year.
   - The ages of the members are: \( 7, 7 + \frac{1}{4}, 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4}, \ldots, 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Sum of the A.P.:**
   - The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
     \]
   - Here, \( S_n = 250 \), \( a = 7 \), and \( d = \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Setting up the Equation:**
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4})
   \]
   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + \frac{n-1}{4})

   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(14 + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)

   \[
   250 = \frac{n}{2} \times \left(\frac{56 + n - 1}{4}\right)

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \):
   \[
   n = \frac{-55 \pm \sqrt{55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000)}}{2 \times 1}

E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more each remaining man will have to contribute if 3 men drop out of the original group of M men.

Initially, the cost per man is:
\[ \text{Initial contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M} \]

After 3 men drop out, the number of men left is \( M - 3 \).

The new contribution per man is:
\[ \text{New contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} \]

The additional amount each remaining man has to contribute is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution:
\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D}{M - 3} - \frac{D}{M} \]

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator:
\[ \text{Additional contribution per man} = \frac{D(M) - D(M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]
\[ = \frac{DM - D(M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \]
\[ = \frac{DM - DM + 3D}{M(M - 3)} \]

1. **Mark's Situation:**
   - Let Mark's money be \( M \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \)
2. \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From the first equation:
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}

Substitute \( M \) in the second equation:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}\left(75 - \frac{J}{2}\right) = 75

Simplify the equation:
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75

\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75

Subtract 25 from both sides:

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{6J - J}{6} = 50

If we work backwards, on the 58th day, the lake would be half-covered because the number of lilies doubles every two days. Therefore, on the 58th day, there were half as many lilies as on the 60th day.

Continuing this pattern, we can determine the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered starting with 64 lilies:

Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played. According to the problem, the team lost 30% of their matches, which means they lost \( 0.3x \) matches.

Since the team won 20 matches, the number of matches they lost can be expressed as:
\[ x - 20 = 0.3x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 0.3x = 20 \]
\[ 0.7x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.7} \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{7} \]

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round \( x \) to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

Now, calculate the number of matches lost:

A)750pi

C)1875pi
D)3000pi
E)7500pi",D,"To find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle traced by the point and then determine how many times the point travels around this circle in 30 seconds.

1. **Calculate the circumference of the circle:**

   The radius of the circle is given as 10 centimeters. The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle is:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ centimeters}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of revolutions in 30 seconds:**

   The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute. First, convert this rate to revolutions per second:
   \[
   \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{300 \text{ revolutions per minute}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = 5 \text{ revolutions per second}
   \]

   In 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is:
   \[
   \text{Total revolutions} = 5 \text{ revolutions per second} \times 30 \text{ seconds} = 150 \text{ revolutions}

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**

   The total distance traveled by the point is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference of the circle:
   \[

\[ x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as a perfect square:

\[ n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 \]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[ x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the range of \( x \) for \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

1. When \( n = 36 \):

   \[ x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64 \]

2. When \( n = 72 \):

   \[ x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4 \]

   \[ \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \]

   \[ x = 72 + 4 \times 6\sqrt{2} + 4 = 76 + 24\sqrt{2} \]

116,,"A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
A)2 months
B)4 months
C)23 months
D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time C joined the business after B joined, based on the profit-sharing ratio.

Let's denote:
- A's investment = Rs. 40,000
- B's investment = Rs. 60,000
- C's investment = Rs. 120,000

The profit is shared in the ratio of the product of capital and time.

1. A's capital is invested for 12 months.
2. B joins after 2 months, so his capital is invested for (12 - 2) = 10 months.
3. Let C join x months after B, so C's capital is invested for (12 - 2 - x) months.

The profit share is given by:
- A's share = 40,000 * 12
- B's share = 60,000 * 10
- C's share = 120,000 * (12 - 2 - x)

We know C's share of the profit is Rs. 150,000 out of a total profit of Rs. 375,000.

The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:
\[ \frac{C's \, share}{Total \, profit} = \frac{150,000}{375,000} = \frac{2}{5} \]

This means C's share of the profit is 2/5 of the total profit.

Now, let's set up the equation for the profit-sharing ratio:
\[ \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{40,000 \times 12 + 60,000 \times 10 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 5 \times 120,000 \times (10 - x) = 2 \times (1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)) \]

\[ 600,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000 + 240,000 \times (10 - x) \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 6,000,000 - 600,000x = 2,160,000 + 2,400,000 - 240,000x \]

\[ 6,000,000 - 600,000x = 4,560,000 - 240,000x \]

Rearranging terms:
\[ 6,000,000 - 4,560,000 = 600,000x - 240,000x \]

\[ 1,440,000 = 360,000x \]

2. **Area of the semicircles:**
   The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius \( r \) of each semicircle is:

   The area of one semicircle is half of the full circle:

Let the number be \( x \).

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to its one third. This can be written as the equation:

- Let the speed of the current be \( c \) kmph.
- The speed of the man against the current is the speed in still water minus the speed of the current: \( 4 - c = 2 \).

Solving for \( c \):
\[ 4 - c = 2 \]
\[ c = 4 - 2 \]
\[ c = 2 \]

Now, to find the man's rate along the current:
- The speed of the man along the current is the speed in still water plus the speed of the current: \( 4 + c \).

Substitute \( c = 2 \):
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.

3. \( 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \)

From the third condition, we can simplify:

   - Zinc in 40 grams of X = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
   - Copper in 40 grams of X = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams

2. **Alloy Y:**

3. **Alloy Z:**
   - Total zinc in Z = Zinc from X + Zinc from Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper in Z = Copper from X + Copper from Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams

4. **Ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**

To simplify the ratio, we can multiply both parts by 3 to eliminate the decimals:

- Zinc = 39.33 * 3 = 118
- Copper = 60.67 * 3 = 182

Now, simplify the ratio 118:182 by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total income, the median income, and the number of family members.

The total income of the family is $9000, and the median income is $3000. The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. This means that half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, and the other half earn more than or equal to $3000.

Let's consider the possible number of family members:

- If there are 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes, which cannot be $3000 unless both earn $3000, which would not sum to $9000.
- If there are 3 members, the median is the income of the second member when sorted. If the median is $3000, the incomes could be $x, $3000, and $y, where $x + $3000 + $y = $9000. Solving for $x and $y gives $x + $y = $6000, which is possible.
- If there are 4 members, the median is the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes must average to $3000, which is possible, but it complicates the distribution.
- If there are 5 members, the median is the third income. If the median is $3000, the incomes could be $x, $y, $3000, $z, and $w, where $x + $y + $3000 + $z + $w = $9000. Solving for $x, $y, $z, and $w gives $x + $y + $z + $w = $6000, which is possible.
- If there are 6 members, the median is the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes must average to $3000, which is possible, but it complicates the distribution.

The simplest and most straightforward solution is when there are 3 members, as it directly allows for one member to earn $3000, which is the median, and the other two members' incomes can be adjusted to sum to $6000.

1. Calculate the number of eligible voters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eligible voters.
- Total voters = 5,000
- Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
- Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000

Let the number of votes the losing candidate received be \( x \).
Then, the winning candidate received \( x + 0.15x = 1.15x \).

Since the total number of votes is 4,000, we have:

A)80
B)120
C)240
D)320
E)360",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.

1. **Calculate the number of golf balls sold:**
   - The store sold 80% of its inventory of 600 golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls sold = 0.8 * 600 = 480.

2. **Determine the number of each color sold:**
   - The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls.
   - Since all white golf balls were sold, half of the 480 sold golf balls were white.
   - Number of white golf balls sold = 480 / 2 = 240.

3. **Determine the initial number of yellow golf balls:**
   - Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it initially had 240 white golf balls.
   - The remaining golf balls at the beginning of the day were yellow.
   - Total golf balls at the beginning = 600.
   - Yellow golf balls at the beginning = Total golf balls - White golf balls = 600 - 240 = 360.

First, let's calculate the travel times and speeds of the trains:

1. **Train M:**
   - Leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time = 4 hours.

2. **Train N:**
   - Leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time = 3.5 hours.

Assume the distance between City A and City B is \( D \).

- Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \)
- Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} \)

Now, let's determine the time when they meet:

- Train M travels for \( x \) hours before meeting Train N.
- Train N travels for \( x - 2 \) hours before meeting Train M (since Train N starts 2 hours after Train M).

The distance covered by Train M in \( x \) hours is \( \frac{D}{4} \times x \).

The distance covered by Train N in \( x - 2 \) hours is \( \frac{D}{3.5} \times (x - 2) \).

Since they meet at the same point, the sum of the distances covered by both trains should equal \( D \):

\[
\frac{D}{4} \times x + \frac{D}{3.5} \times (x - 2) = D

Divide the entire equation by \( D \):

\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{x - 2}{3.5} = 1

To solve for \( x \), first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{x - 2}{3.5} = 1

Convert 3.5 to a fraction: \( 3.5 = \frac{7}{2} \).

The common denominator of 4 and \( \frac{7}{2} \) is 14.

Convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = \frac{7x}{28}
\]
\[
\frac{x - 2}{3.5} = \frac{2(x - 2)}{7} = \frac{4(x - 2)}{14}

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{7x}{28} + \frac{4(x - 2)}{14} = 1

Multiply through by 28 to clear the denominators:

\[
7x + 8(x - 2) = 28

A)1 minute
B)2 minutes
C)3 minutes

Janice's speed is 10 miles per hour, which means she bikes \(\frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6}\) miles per minute.

Jennie's speed is 20 miles per hour, which means she bikes \(\frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3}\) miles per minute.

Together, they bike \(\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3}\) miles per minute. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator:

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the height of the room (h) to its semi-perimeter (s) is given as 2:5.
   - This means \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls:**
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.

   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total length of paper used is \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \) meters.

3. **Calculating the Area Covered by the Paper:**
   - Since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, the area covered by the paper is \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.

4. **Adjusting for Doors and Windows:**
   - An area of 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows.

   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height of the room.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \).
   - Then, the area of the walls is \( P \times h = 80 \).

6. **Using the Ratio:**
   - From the ratio, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{P}{2} = \frac{P}{5} \).
   - Substitute \( h = \frac{P}{5} \) into the area equation: \( P \times \frac{P}{5} = 80 \).

A)$8
B)$10
C)$13.6
D)$22.9
E)$40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of each article and then calculate the new price after the 15% decrease.

Let's denote the original price of each article as \( x \).

After the price decreases by 15%, the new price of each article becomes \( 0.85x \).

According to the problem, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

Let's set up the equation based on the information given:

1. The number of articles Anna could buy at the original price is \( \frac{300}{x} \).
2. The number of articles Anna can buy at the new price is \( \frac{300}{0.85x} \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of articles is 5:

\[
\frac{300}{0.85x} = \frac{300}{x} + 5
\]

Now, let's solve this equation for \( x \):

1. Multiply through by \( 0.85x \cdot x \) to clear the denominators:

\[
300x = 300 \cdot 0.85x + 5 \cdot 0.85x \cdot x

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
300x = 255x + 4.25x^2

3. Rearrange the terms:

Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end, and Radha is 6th from the right end. When Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, she becomes 8th from the right end. Similarly, when Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, she becomes 14th from the left end.

After these shifts, there are 6 children between Neha and Radha. Therefore, the position of Neha from the left end is 14, and the position of Radha from the right end is 8. The number of children between them is 6.

Initially, the mixture contains:
- 30% sand = 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg of sand
- 70% clay = 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg of clay

Let \( x \) kg of the mixture be removed and replaced with pure sand. After removing \( x \) kg of the mixture, the remaining mixture will have:
- Sand: \( 3 - 0.3x \) kg
- Clay: \( 7 - 0.7x \) kg

Since we replace \( x \) kg of the mixture with pure sand, the amount of sand added is \( x \) kg. Therefore, the new amount of sand in the mixture is:
\[ (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \]

The total weight of the new mixture is still 10 kg (since we remove \( x \) kg and add \( x \) kg of sand).

We want the new mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 3 + 0.7x = 5 \]

Let's assume the cost of the ice cream cake is \( C \).

- Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is \( \frac{C}{5} \) per hour.
- Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, her rate of earning is \( \frac{C}{4} \) per hour.

When they work together, their combined rate of earning is:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20:

\[
\frac{C}{5} = \frac{4C}{20}

\[
\frac{C}{4} = \frac{5C}{20}

A)$5102

D)$202
E)$200",B,"To calculate the interest accrued on the bond, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \)
- \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded every six months)
- \( t = 1 \)

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2} \]

\[ A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 \]

\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]

\[ A = 5618 \]

The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:

\[ \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618 \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618.

We are given a multiplication problem where each letter represents a unique digit. The goal is to find the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, and I that satisfy the multiplication and match one of the given choices.

Let's analyze the multiplication:

1. The number ""MAD"" is multiplied by ""BE"" to give the result ""AMID"".
2. The partial product ""MAD"" is the result of multiplying ""MAD"" by ""E"".
3. The partial product ""RAE"" is the result of multiplying ""MAD"" by ""B"", shifted one position to the left.

We need to find a combination of digits that satisfies these conditions and matches one of the choices.

Let's try to solve it step by step:

- Assume M = 9, as it is the leading digit in the result ""AMID"" and the choices all start with 9.
- The number ""MAD"" is a 3-digit number, and ""BE"" is a 2-digit number.
- The result ""AMID"" is a 4-digit number.

Let's try the choices one by one:

Choice A) 9 2 0 0
- MAD = 920
- BE = 00
- AMID = 9200

This doesn't work because multiplying by 00 would result in 0, not 9200.

Choice B) 9 2 0 9
- MAD = 920
- BE = 09
- AMID = 8280

This doesn't work because 920 * 9 = 8280, not 9209.

Choice C) 9 2 0 1
- MAD = 920
- BE = 01
- AMID = 920

This doesn't work because 920 * 1 = 920, not 9201.

Choice D) 9 2 0 7
- MAD = 920
- BE = 07
- AMID = 6440

This doesn't work because 920 * 7 = 6440, not 9207.

Choice E) 9 2 2 2
- MAD = 922
- BE = 02
- AMID = 1844

This doesn't work because 922 * 2 = 1844, not 9222.

After checking all the choices, none of them seem to satisfy the multiplication table as given. However, the problem might have a typo or an error in the choices. Based on the structure of the problem, the most likely intended solution is:

Choice B) 9 2 0 9

This choice seems to be the closest to a valid multiplication, assuming a possible error in the problem setup or choices.

D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"To find the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot, we first need to determine the area of this boundary.

Given:
- The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 metres.
- The boundary is 1 metre wide.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2(l + w) \]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle.

Since the perimeter is 340 metres:
\[ 2(l + w) = 340 \]
\[ l + w = 170 \]

The area of the boundary is the difference between the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) and the area of the original rectangle.

The dimensions of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) will be \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \) because the boundary is 1 metre wide on all sides.

The area of the larger rectangle is:
\[ (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4 \]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[ lw \]

The area of the boundary is:
\[ (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) - lw = 2l + 2w + 4 \]

Since \( l + w = 170 \):
\[ 2l + 2w = 2 \times 170 = 340 \]

Thus, the area of the boundary is:
\[ 340 + 4 = 344 \text{ square metres} \]

The cost of gardening is at the rate of 10 per square metre:

Let's assume the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company is \( R \).

1. **Revenue from Novels:**
   - 34% of the total revenue came from novels.
   - Therefore, revenue from novels = \( 0.34R \).

2. **Revenue from Biographies:**
   - The remaining revenue after novels = \( R - 0.34R = 0.66R \).
   - 1/3 of this remaining revenue came from biographies.
   - Therefore, revenue from biographies = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 0.66R = 0.22R \).

3. **Ratio of Revenue from Novels to Biographies:**
   - The ratio is given by dividing the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies:

1. **Lunches:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and Fernando needs to choose 3 days to have lunch.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{3} \).

2. **Dinners:**
   - Since Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, he can only have dinner on Monday to Thursday.

- B's rate of work is 1 wall per 45 minutes, or \(\frac{1}{45}\) of the wall per minute.

When A and B work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates:

Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second:

   - Let \( N \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - 90% of \( N \) are non-defective and equal to 7200 pens delivered.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     0.9N = 7200
     \]
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**
   - Total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is Rs. 57,600.
   - Cost per pen = Total cost / Number of pens manufactured:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pen} = \frac{57,600}{8000} = 7.2
     \]

Thus, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.

E)49",B,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let the two-digit number be represented as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the digit in the ten's place and \(b\) is the digit in the unit's place.

According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
\[
10a + b = a + b + 18
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
10a + b - a - b = 18

\[
a = 2

The problem also states that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place:
\[
b = 2a

Substituting \(a = 2\) into the equation for \(b\):
\[
b = 2 \times 2 = 4

1. **Understanding the floor function**: The floor function \([x]\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

2. **Expression \(L(x, y)\)**:
   - \([x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

A)After 6 minutes
B)After 12 minutes
C)After 18 minutes
D)After 24 minutes
E)none",B,"To find when the three bells will ring together again, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which they ring: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

1. **Prime factorization**:
   - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
   - 40 = 2^3 * 5
   - 48 = 2^4 * 3

2. **LCM calculation**:
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:
     - Highest power of 2: 2^4
     - Highest power of 3: 3^2
     - Highest power of 5: 5

Given:
- Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
- Shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters
- Shadow of the tree = 15 meters

Let the height of the tree be \( h \).

The proportion based on the similar triangles is:

D)5/18
E)13/45",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

Let's break it down:

1. **Probability that Alan answers correctly**: Alan guesses randomly, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability that Roger answers correctly**: Roger cheats, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Probability that Peter answers correctly**: Peter calculates the answer, so his probability of answering correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

We want the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to consider the cases where either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

- **Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger does not**: 
  - Probability that Alan answers correctly: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
  - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \)

- **Probability that Peter answers correctly and Roger does not**:
  - Probability that Peter answers correctly: \( \frac{5}{6} \)
  - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
  - Combined probability: \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \)

Now, we add these probabilities together to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:

\[
\frac{1}{15} + \frac{5}{18}

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 18 is 90.

- Convert \( \frac{1}{15} \) to a fraction with denominator 90: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{15} = \frac{6}{90}

- Convert \( \frac{5}{18} \) to a fraction with denominator 90:
  \[
  \frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{90}

Add the fractions:

\frac{6}{90} + \frac{25}{90} = \frac{31}{90}

Let's denote:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
- Time (T) = 2 years
- Rate of interest (R) = r%

The formula for Simple Interest (S.I.) is:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

The formula for Compound Interest (C.I.) is:
\[ \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

The difference between C.I. and S.I. is given as Rs. 72:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72 \]

Substituting the formulas, we have:
\[ P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = 72 \]

Substitute P = 5000 and T = 2:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplify:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5000 to simplify:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{100R}{5000} = \frac{72}{5000} \]

\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Let \( x = \frac{R}{100} \), then:
\[ (1 + x)^2 - 1 - 2x = 0.0144 \]

Expanding \( (1 + x)^2 \):
\[ 1 + 2x + x^2 - 1 - 2x = 0.0144 \]

\[ x^2 = 0.0144 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ x = \sqrt{0.0144} \]

\[ x = 0.12 \]

Since \( x = \frac{R}{100} \), we have:

- \( V \) as the number of files infected by a virus.
- \( W \) as the number of files infected by a worm.
- \( B \) as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of files is 250.
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, the number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5B \).
4. The number of files infected by a worm is the sum of those infected only by a worm and those infected by both a virus and a worm, so \( W = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \).

We also know that the total number of files is the sum of those infected by a virus, those infected by a worm, and those infected by both:
\[ V + W - B = 250 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 125 + 3.5B - B = 250 \]
\[ 125 + 2.5B = 250 \]
\[ 2.5B = 250 - 125 \]

The number of files infected by a worm is:
\[ W = 3.5B = 3.5 \times 50 = 175 \]

Finally, the number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus those infected by a worm:

\[ M + S = 5100 \]

Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will invest his share for 3 years to reach the age of 26. Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will invest his share for 2 years to reach the age of 26.

   - The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - Therefore, each occupies half of the total volume of the coin.

3. **Weight of the original coin:**
   - The total weight of the coin is 30 grams.
   - Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, and silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight distribution is:
     - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho \).
     - The density of silver is \( 2\rho \).
     - If \( V_a \) is the volume of aluminum and \( V_s \) is the volume of silver, then \( V_a = V_s \).
     - Weight of aluminum = \( \rho V_a \).
     - Weight of silver = \( 2\rho V_s = 2\rho V_a \).
     - Total weight = \( \rho V_a + 2\rho V_a = 3\rho V_a = 30 \) grams.
     - Therefore, \( \rho V_a = 10 \) grams (weight of aluminum).

4. **Volume of the new coin:**
   - The new coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.
   - Radius \( r = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm.
   - Volume \( V' = \pi r^2 h = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 \).

5. **Weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum:**
   - The density of aluminum is \( \rho \).
   - Weight of the new coin = \( \rho V' \).
   - We know \( \rho V_a = 10 \) grams, and \( V_a = \frac{V}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( \rho = \frac{10}{V_a} \).
   - Substitute \( V_a = \frac{\pi (7.5)^2 \times 2}{2} = \pi (7.5)^2 \).
   - \( \rho = \frac{10}{\pi (7.5)^2} \).

6. **Calculate the weight of the new coin:**
   - \( V' = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \).
   - Weight of the new coin = \( \rho V' = \frac{10}{\pi (7.5)^2} \times 225\pi \).
   - Simplify: \( \frac{10 \times 225\pi}{\pi \times 56.25} = \frac{2250}{56.25} = 40 \) grams.

Therefore, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams.

According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

   - Time to ride 15 km = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - 100 km / 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder.
   - 6 segments cover 90 km, leaving 10 km remaining.

3. **Calculate the rest time for 6 segments:**
   - Shweta rests for 10 minutes (or 1/6 of an hour) at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - Total rest time for 6 segments = 6 * (1/6) hour = 1 hour.

Let's break down the process:

1. **8:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of the food, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
2. **9:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 2/3, which is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original amount. This leaves 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9 of the original amount.
3. **10:00 am**: The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining 4/9, which is (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original amount. This leaves 4/9 - 4/27 = 8/27 of the original amount.

The square root of 1397 is approximately 37.4, so we check divisibility by prime numbers up to 37:

- 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 1397 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), not divisible by 3).
- 1397 is not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).
- 1397 is not divisible by 7 (1397 divided by 7 gives a non-integer).
- 1397 is not divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits \( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \), divisible by 11, so 1397 is divisible by 11).

Let's divide 1397 by 11:

A)46
B)81
C)126
D)252
E)None",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular parking space and then calculate its area.

Let's denote the length of the unpainted side as \( l = 9 \) feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is given as 37 feet. Since the parking space is rectangular, the painted sides consist of two widths and one length. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2w + l = 37 \]

Substituting the given length \( l = 9 \) into the equation, we have:

\[ 2w + 9 = 37 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2w = 28 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( w \):

\[ w = 14 \]

Now we have the dimensions of the parking space: the length \( l = 9 \) feet and the width \( w = 14 \) feet.

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:

\[ A = l \times w = 9 \times 14 = 126 \]

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet.

A)71
B)62
C)43
D)67
E)40",A,"To find the weight of the new man, we can set up the problem as follows:

1. Let the total weight of the original 10 oarsmen be \( W \).
2. The average weight of the original 10 oarsmen is \( \frac{W}{10} \).

When the oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced by the new man, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg. Therefore, the new average weight is:

\[
\frac{W - 53 + \text{weight of new man}}{10} = \frac{W}{10} + 1.8
\]

Let's denote the weight of the new man as \( x \). Then:

\[
\frac{W - 53 + x}{10} = \frac{W}{10} + 1.8
\]

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
W - 53 + x = W + 18

Simplify the equation:

\[
x - 53 = 18

Add 53 to both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 18 + 53 = 71

A)11

C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of balls, \( n \). If the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected, we are left with \( n - 1 \) balls to choose from.

The number of ways to select 2 balls from \( n - 1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = 45
\]

We need to solve this equation for \( n \).

The combination formula is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

Setting this equal to 45, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \).

Calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-88) = 9 + 352 = 361
\]

The square root of 361 is 19. So, the solutions for \( n \) are:

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( n \):

1. \( n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \)
2. \( n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = \frac{-16}{2} = -8 \)

A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only
E)I and III only",B,"To determine which statements must be true about \( Q \), we need to analyze the conditions under which a positive integer has exactly 5 factors.

The number of factors of a positive integer \( n \) with the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k} \) is given by:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1)
\]

For \( n \) to have exactly 5 factors, the product of these terms must equal 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if one of the terms is 5 and all others are 1. This implies that the prime factorization of \( n \) must be of the form \( n = p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because:

\[
(a_1 + 1) = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad a_2 + 1 = a_3 + 1 = \cdots = a_k + 1 = 1
\]

This means \( a_1 = 4 \) and \( a_2 = a_3 = \cdots = a_k = 0 \), leading to \( n = p^4 \).

Now, let's evaluate the given statements:

I. \( Q \) is the square of a prime number.
   - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors is \( (2+1) = 3 \), which is not 5. So, this statement is false.

II. \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number.
   - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4+1) = 5 \). This statement is true.

III. \( Q \) is the product of two prime numbers.
   - If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), then the number of factors is \( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \), which is not 5. So, this statement is false.

239,,"Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000?
A)5/7
B)3/5
C)4/7
D)2/5
E)2/7",D,"To find the probability that a number chosen from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000\} \) is relatively prime to 1000, we need to determine how many numbers in this set are relatively prime to 1000.

First, we find the prime factorization of 1000:
\[ 1000 = 2^3 \times 5^3 \]

The Euler's Totient Function \( \phi(n) \) gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for the totient function is:
\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right) \]
where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

Applying this to 1000:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) \]

Calculating each term:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \]

Thus:
\[ \phi(1000) = 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} = 1000 \times \frac{4}{10} = 1000 \times 0.4 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1000 is:
\[ \frac{\phi(1000)}{1000} = \frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"To find the original amount of money that Charles invested, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8 percent)
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is approximately $50,000.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( J + S + F = 100 \)

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This implies that the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age. So, \( F - J = 2S - S = S \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This implies that the difference in age between Joe's father and Joe is the same as the difference in age between Joe's father and Joe's sister's age when she was as old as her father. So, \( F - J = 2(F - S) \).

Let's solve these equations:

From equation 2, we have:
\[ F - J = S \]
\[ F = J + S \]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation 1:
\[ J + S + (J + S) = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 2S = 100 \]
\[ J + S = 50 \]

Simplifying, we have:

1. **Determine the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is unfenced and is 10 meters, so let's assume \( W = 10 \) meters.
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, so we have the equation:

252,,"Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
A)4
B)5
C)6
D)7
E)8",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each friend eats the candies and then combine their rates to find the time it takes for both to finish the jar together.

First, let's find the rate at which P eats the candies:
- P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes. Therefore, P's rate is 1 jar per 10 minutes, or \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.

Next, let's find the rate at which Q eats the candies:
- Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. Therefore, Q's rate is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the jar per 5 minutes, or \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.

Now, we add their rates together to find the combined rate:
- Combined rate = P's rate + Q's rate = \(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\) of the jar per minute.

To find the time it takes for both to finish the entire jar together, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:
- Time = \(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{5}} = 5\) minutes.

Therefore, it would take them 5 minutes to empty the jar together.

The correct answer is B) 5.",True,,,,,
253,,"A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
A)125
B)150
C)225
D)250
E)275",A,"To find the total profit, we first need to determine the profit made on each bag of ice. The profit is 20% of the selling price.

1. Calculate the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Profit per bag} = 20\% \times 1.25 = 0.20 \times 1.25 = 0.25
   \]

2. Calculate the total profit for 500 bags:
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = 500 \times 0.25 = 125
   \]

Therefore, the total profit made from selling 500 bags of ice is $125.

The correct choice is:
```
A) 125
