0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Setting Up the Problem:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 45° be \( x_1 \).
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 60° be \( x_2 \).

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Finding the Distance Traveled:**
   - The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance traveled in 10 minutes is:
     \[
     x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]

5. **Finding the Speed of the Car:**
   - The speed of the car is the distance traveled divided by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
     \]

6. **Finding the Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \):
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

7. **Finding the Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The time to reach the base is the remaining distance divided by the speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

8. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
     \]

Therefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the item.

2. **Apply the Discount:**
   - The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( x - 0.22x = 0.78x \).

3. **Apply the Coupon:**
   - The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is \( 0.78x - 20 \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
     \]
     \[
     1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
     \]

   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     1.56x - x = 3.8 + 40
     \]
     \[
     0.56x = 43.8
     \]

   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{43.8}{0.56}

B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

1. **Understand the given probabilities:**
   - Probability that Stock A will increase: \( P(A) = 0.56 \)
   - Probability that Stock B will increase: \( P(B) = 0.74 \)

2. **Calculate the probability that each stock will not increase:**
   - Probability that Stock A will not increase: \( P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \)
   - Probability that Stock B will not increase: \( P(\text{not } B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \)

3. **Calculate the probability that neither stock will increase:**
   - The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is the product of the probabilities that each will not increase, assuming independence:
   \[
   P(\text{not } A \text{ and not } B) = P(\text{not } A) \times P(\text{not } B) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144

4. **Check the options:**
   - The calculated probability \( 0.1144 \) is not among the given options. However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur, which implies considering the maximum possible overlap or dependence between the events.

5. **Consider the greatest possible probability:**
   - The greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither occurs is:
   \[
   1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs.360.

Step 1: Understand the relationship between cost price, selling price, and profit.
- The selling price (SP) is the cost price (CP) plus the profit.
- Profit is given as a percentage of the cost price.

Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information.
- Let the cost price be \( CP \).
- The profit is 20% of the cost price, which can be expressed as \( 0.20 \times CP \).
- The selling price is given as Rs.360.

Step 3: Write the equation for the selling price.
\[ SP = CP + \text{Profit} \]
\[ 360 = CP + 0.20 \times CP \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
- Combine like terms:
\[ 360 = CP + 0.20 \times CP \]
\[ 360 = 1.20 \times CP \]

Step 5: Solve for the cost price (CP).
- Divide both sides of the equation by 1.20 to isolate CP:
\[ CP = \frac{360}{1.20} \]

Step 6: Calculate the cost price.

E)280",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total production cost for the year:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

   Total production cost for the year = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400.

2. **Determine the required yearly revenue to achieve the desired profit:**
   - The desired yearly profit is $626,400.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue - Production Cost.

   Therefore, the required yearly revenue = Desired Profit + Total Production Cost
   = $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.

3. **Calculate the total number of components sold in a year:**
   - The company sells 420 units every month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

   Total components sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.

4. **Determine the minimum selling price per component:**
   - We need the total revenue from selling 5,040 units to be at least $1,180,800.
   - Let the selling price per component be \( x \).

   Total revenue = Selling Price per Component * Total Components Sold
   = \( x \times 5,040 \).

   We set up the equation:
   \( x \times 5,040 = 1,180,800 \).

   Solving for \( x \):
   \( x = \frac{1,180,800}{5,040} \).

   Calculate \( x \):
   \( x = 234.1269841 \).

   Since the selling price must be a whole number and at least this amount, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $235.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Calculate Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate Non-Defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is the total staplers minus the defective ones: \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

   - Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
   - Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of production:**
   - The combined rate of both machines is the sum of their individual rates:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}

The formula for conditional probability is:

\[
P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

However, since A and B are independent events, the probability of both A and B occurring, \( P(A \cap B) \), is given by:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)

A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Scenario 1: Walking 20 steps**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - You reach the bottom in 10 minutes.

2. **Scenario 2: Walking 10 steps**
   - You walk 10 steps and then stop.
   - You reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

**Scenario 1:**
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- Time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.
- The speed of the elevator is \( v = \frac{S - 20}{10} \).

**Scenario 2:**
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- Time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.
- The speed of the elevator is \( v = \frac{S - 10}{20} \).

Since the speed of the elevator \( v \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( v \) equal to each other:

\[
\frac{S - 20}{10} = \frac{S - 10}{20}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( S \):

\[
20(S - 20) = 10(S - 10)
\]

Expand both sides:

\[
20S - 400 = 10S - 100
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( S \):

\[
20S - 10S = 400 - 100
\]

\[
10S = 300
\]

\[
S = 30
\]

Now that we know \( S = 30 \), we can find the speed of the elevator \( v \).

Using the expression from Scenario 1:

\[
v = \frac{S - 20}{10} = \frac{30 - 20}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \text{ step/minute}
\]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the denominator:**

   \[
   13 \times 13 - 156
   \]

   First, calculate \(13 \times 13\):

   \[
   13 \times 13 = 169

   Then subtract 156:

   \[
   169 - 156 = 13
   \]

   So, the denominator is 13.

2. **Set up the equation with the denominator:**

   \[
   \frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6

3. **Multiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:**

   \[
   5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 \times 13

4. **Simplify the left side of the equation:**

   Combine the constants:

   \[
   5 - 15 - 7 = -17

Step 1: Understand the profit percentage.
- The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price. This means that 25% of the selling price of each bag is profit.

Step 2: Calculate the profit per bag.
- Selling price per bag = $100
- Profit percentage = 25%
- Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25

Step 3: Determine the total number of bags sold to make $3,000 in profit.
- Total profit = $3,000
- Profit per bag = $25
- Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag = $3,000 / $25

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The time Alex worked is \( 7A \) hours (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The time Jacob worked is \( 9J \) hours (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both worked for almost the same number of hours, so:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations step-by-step:

Step 1: Express \( A \) in terms of \( J \) using the first equation:
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Step 2: Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the approximate equality of hours:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Step 3: Simplify the equation:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]

Step 4: Rearrange the terms to solve for \( J \):
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]

Step 5: Solve for \( J \):
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is approximately 15.

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance traveled by the jeep (in kilometers).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

2. **Forward Journey:**
   - The jeep takes 6 hours to travel the distance \( d \).
   - Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we have:
     \[
     d = v \times 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed during the forward journey is:
     \[
     v = \frac{d}{6}
     \]

3. **Return Journey:**
   - The jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr for the return journey.
   - The new speed is \( v + 12 \).
   - The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.
   - Using the distance formula again, we have:
     \[
     d = (v + 12) \times 4
     \]

4. **Set Up Equation:**
   - We have two expressions for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 6v \quad \text{(from the forward journey)}
     \]
     \[
     d = 4(v + 12) \quad \text{(from the return journey)}
     \]

5. **Equate and Solve:**
   - Set the two expressions for \( d \) equal to each other:
     \[
     6v = 4(v + 12)
     \]
   - Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     6v = 4v + 48
     \]
   - Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:
     \[
     2v = 48
     \]
   - Solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = 24
     \]

6. **Calculate Distance:**
   - Substitute \( v = 24 \) back into the expression for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144
     \]

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

   - Half of 2 is 1, so your brother was 1 year old when you were 2 years old.
   - The age difference between you and your brother is 2 - 1 = 1 year.

2. **Calculate your brother's current age:**
   - You are now 60 years old.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define the wholesale cost:**
   - Let the wholesale cost be \( W \).

2. **Calculate the original retail price:**
   - The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost.
   - Therefore, the original retail price is \( W + 0.6W = 1.6W \).

3. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price.
   - 20% less than the original retail price means it was sold for \( 1.6W - 0.2 \times 1.6W \).
   - Simplifying, the selling price is \( 1.6W \times (1 - 0.2) = 1.6W \times 0.8 = 1.28W \).

4. **Determine the selling price as a percentage more than the wholesale cost:**
   - The selling price is \( 1.28W \).
   - The wholesale cost is \( W \).
   - The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is \( 1.28W - W = 0.28W \).
   - To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{0.28W}{W} \times 100\% = 28\%

1. **Understand the scale of the map:**
   - The map scale is given as 1/4 inch represents 10 miles.

2. **Determine how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches:**
   - Since 1/4 inch is the unit of measurement on the map, we need to find out how many 1/4 inches fit into 20 inches.
   - To do this, divide 20 inches by 1/4 inch:
     \[
     \text{Number of } \frac{1}{4} \text{ inches} = \frac{20}{\frac{1}{4}} = 20 \times 4 = 80
     \]
   - So, there are 80 quarter-inches in 20 inches.

3. **Calculate the actual distance:**
   - Since each 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, we multiply the number of 1/4 inches by 10 miles:

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet and then calculate its area.

1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We have a rectangular sheet that can be folded into two equal halves in two different ways.
   - When folded along one set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm.
   - When folded along the other set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let the original dimensions of the rectangle be \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

3. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When folded along the length, each half will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each half is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{l}{2} + w \right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the rectangular solid.
The dimensions of the rectangular solid are given as 3, 4, and 15.

Step 2: Calculate the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

Step 3: Substitute the given dimensions into the formula.
Here, \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 15\).
\[ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} \]

Step 4: Calculate the squares of the dimensions.
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]
\[ 15^2 = 225 \]

Step 5: Add the squares together.
\[ 9 + 16 + 225 = 250 \]

Step 6: Take the square root of the sum to find the diagonal.
\[ d = \sqrt{250} \]

Step 7: Simplify the square root.
\[ \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10} \]

Step 8: Approximate the value of \(5\sqrt{10}\).
Since \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623\), we have:

   w \cdot p_w + b \cdot p_b = 100
   \]

4. Substitute \( p_w = p_b + 1 \) into the cost equation:
   \[
   w \cdot (p_b + 1) + b \cdot p_b = 100
   \]
   \[
   w \cdot p_b + w + b \cdot p_b = 100
   \]
   \[
   (w + b) \cdot p_b + w = 100
   \]

5. Since \( w + b = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   18 \cdot p_b + w = 100
   \]
   \[
   w = 100 - 18 \cdot p_b
   \]

6. We also have \( w + b = 18 \), so:
   \[
   b = 18 - w
   \]

7. Substitute \( w = 100 - 18 \cdot p_b \) into \( b = 18 - w \):
   \[
   b = 18 - (100 - 18 \cdot p_b)
   \]
   \[
   b = 18 - 100 + 18 \cdot p_b
   \]
   \[
   b = 18 \cdot p_b - 82
   \]

8. Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) such that both are non-negative and satisfy the equations. We can test the options given:

   - Option A: \( w = 10, b = 8 \)
     - Check: \( w + b = 10 + 8 = 18 \) (satisfied)
     - Substitute into cost equation:
       \[
       10 \cdot (p_b + 1) + 8 \cdot p_b = 100
       \]
       \[
       10p_b + 10 + 8p_b = 100
       \]
       \[
       18p_b + 10 = 100
       \]
       \[
       18p_b = 90
       \]
       \[
       p_b = 5
       \]
     - Check: \( p_w = p_b + 1 = 6 \)
     - Total cost: \( 10 \cdot 6 + 8 \cdot 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 \) (satisfied)

   - Option B: \( w = 9, b = 8 \)
     - Check: \( w + b = 9 + 8 = 17 \) (not satisfied)

   - Option C: \( w = 7, b = 8 \)
     - Check: \( w + b = 7 + 8 = 15 \) (not satisfied)

   - Option D: \( w = 5, b = 6 \)
     - Check: \( w + b = 5 + 6 = 11 \) (not satisfied)

   - Option E: \( w = 11, b = 12 \)
     - Check: \( w + b = 11 + 12 = 23 \) (not satisfied)

The only option that satisfies all conditions is Option A.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - Since hose A filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool, the remaining part of the pool to be filled is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours, or \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it would take hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B's rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Let's break down the information given:

1. 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
2. 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club.

We need to find the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team. Let's denote the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team as \( x \).

From the second piece of information, we know that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Since 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and this represents 80% of the swim team members, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.80x = 0.24 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.80:

B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   The man pays Rs.31.50 each month for 12 months.
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 31.50 \times 12 = 378

2. **Determine the Total Interest Paid:**
   The interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal amount borrowed.
   \[
   \text{Interest paid} = 378 - 360 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the Interest Rate:**
   The interest rate is calculated on the principal amount for the entire period. Since the period is 1 year (12 months), we can use the simple interest formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the interest is Rs.18, the principal is Rs.360, and the time is 1 year. We need to find the rate (R).

   Rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:
   \[
   R = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} = \frac{18}{360 \times 1} = \frac{18}{360}

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Price**: Assume the original price of the product is \( P \).

2. **Price after 30% Reduction**: 
   - A 30% reduction means the price is reduced by 30% of \( P \).
   - The reduced price is \( P - 0.30P = 0.70P \).

3. **Determine the Increase Needed**:
   - We need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price from \( 0.70P \) back to \( P \).

4. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - The increase needed is \( P - 0.70P = 0.30P \).

5. **Percentage Increase**:
   - The percentage increase is calculated based on the reduced price, \( 0.70P \).
   - Percentage increase = \(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Reduced Price}} \times 100\%\)
   - Percentage increase = \(\frac{0.30P}{0.70P} \times 100\%\)
   - Simplifying, we get \(\frac{0.30}{0.70} \times 100\%\)
   - \(\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \frac{3}{7}\)

   - The total contract is for 3 houses.
   - Work remaining = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Remaining work = \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) of a house.

5. **Calculate the time for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.
   - To paint \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take him \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract.

Train A leaves every 16 minutes, and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. We are looking for the smallest amount of time after which both trains will leave the station simultaneously again.

Step 1: Identify the time intervals.
- Train A leaves every 16 minutes.
- Train B leaves every 17 minutes.

Step 2: Find the LCM of 16 and 17.
- Since 16 and 17 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product.

Step 3: Calculate the product of 16 and 17.

B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of a hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understand the structure of the hollow cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is subtracted from both sides.

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes:**
   - The entire outer cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - The outer cube has a volume of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part is a cube of size 3 cm, which has a volume of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Determine the number of smaller cubes in the hollow structure:**
   - The number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow structure is the total number of cubes in the outer cube minus the cubes in the inner hollow part: \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The total number of faces for all 98 smaller cubes is \(98 \times 6 = 588\) faces.
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted, which means the outer surface area is painted.
   - The outer surface area of the cube is \(5 \times 5 \times 6 = 150\) square cm, which corresponds to 150 painted faces.

5. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:**
   - The number of unpainted faces is the total number of faces minus the painted faces: \(588 - 150 = 438\).

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 438.

1. **Identify the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - We are given that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored, the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates is 100% - 10% = 90%.

3. **Calculate the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the rest (which are vanilla chocolates) are squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% of the 90% vanilla chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% of 90% = 0.9 * 90% = 81%.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog makes a net progress of 1 meter (3 meters up during the day minus 2 meters down at night).

2. **Days to Reach 27 Meters**: 
   - The frog needs to reach a height of 30 meters to get out of the well.
   - However, if the frog reaches 27 meters by the end of a day, the next day's jump of 3 meters will take it out of the well without slipping back.
   - Therefore, we need to calculate how many days it takes to reach 27 meters.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Since the frog makes a net progress of 1 meter per day, it will take 27 days to reach 27 meters.

4. **Final Jump**:

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. We also need to determine which of the given options could be one of these numbers.

Let's denote the first of these 5 consecutive odd numbers as \( x \). Then the numbers can be expressed as:
- \( x \)
- \( x + 2 \)
- \( x + 4 \)
- \( x + 6 \)
- \( x + 8 \)

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20
\]

We are given that this sum, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{5(x + 4)}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}
\]

This expression \(\frac{x + 4}{2}\) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer. Thus:
\[
\frac{x + 4}{2} = n^2 \implies x + 4 = 2n^2 \implies x = 2n^2 - 4
\]

Since \( x \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( n \) such that \( x \) is a two-digit number and odd.

Let's test some values of \( n \):

1. \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   x = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 9 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad (\text{not odd})
   \]

2. \( n = 4 \):
   \[
   x = 2(4)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 16 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \quad (\text{not odd})
   \]

3. \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   x = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 25 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \quad (\text{not odd})
   \]

4. \( n = 6 \):
   \[
   x = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 36 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad (\text{not odd})

5. \( n = 7 \):
   \[
   x = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 49 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \quad (\text{not odd})

6. \( n = 8 \):
   \[
   x = 2(8)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 64 - 4 = 128 - 4 = 124 \quad (\text{not a two-digit number})

7. \( n = 9 \):
   \[
   x = 2(9)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 81 - 4 = 162 - 4 = 158 \quad (\text{not a two-digit number})

   \[
   x = 2(10)^2 - 4 = 2 \times 100 - 4 = 200 - 4 = 196 \quad (\text{not a two-digit number})
   \]

Let's try \( n = 5 \) again, but check the next odd number:
- \( x = 47 \) (since 46 is not odd, the next odd number is 47)

Now, let's check if 47 can be part of a sequence of 5 consecutive odd numbers:
- 47, 49, 51, 53, 55

Sum of these numbers:

Now, let's check if 67 can be part of a sequence of 5 consecutive odd numbers:
- 67, 69, 71, 73, 75

Sum of these numbers:
\[
67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355

When divided by 10:
\[

2. **Cricket Interest**: 
   - 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket.

4. **Not Interested in Any Games**: 
   - 20 students are not interested in any games.

According to the problem, the sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, and those not interested in any games should equal the total number of students in the class. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

Let's simplify the equation:

- Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal: \(\frac{4}{5} = 0.80\).
- Substitute into the equation:

\[
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
\]

- Combine like terms:

\[
0.98x + 20 = x
\]

- Subtract \(0.98x\) from both sides to isolate the constant:

\[
20 = x - 0.98x
\]

- Simplify the right side:

\[
20 = 0.02x

- Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 0.02:

\[
x = \frac{20}{0.02}

\[
x = 1000

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have three people: Q, R, and T.
   - Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.
   - The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years.

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let Q's age be \( q \).
   - Let R's age be \( r \).
   - Let T's age be \( t \).

3. **Translating the Conditions into Equations:**
   - The condition ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T"" can be written as:
     \[
     r - q = q - t
     \]
   - Simplifying the above equation gives:
     \[
     r + t = 2q
     \]

4. **Using the Given Information:**
   - We are given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
     \[
     r + t = 50
     \]

5. **Equating the Two Expressions for \( r + t \):**
   - From the equations \( r + t = 2q \) and \( r + t = 50 \), we equate them:
     \[
     2q = 50
     \]
   - Solving for \( q \), we get:
     \[
     q = 25
     \]

6. **Finding the Difference Between R and Q's Age:**
   - From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we know:
     \[
     r - q = 25 - t
     \]
   - Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( r \) as:
     \[
     r = 50 - t
     \]
   - Substituting \( r = 50 - t \) into \( r - q = 25 - t \):
     \[
     (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     25 - t = 25 - t
     \]
   - This equation is always true, meaning the difference \( r - q \) is consistent with the given conditions.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The difference between R and Q's age is \( r - q = 25 - t \).
   - However, without specific values for \( r \) and \( t \), we cannot determine a specific numerical difference between R and Q's age.

1. **Initial Charge**: The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. This means that after the first quarter-mile, you will have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left.

2. **Additional Distance Cost**: After the first quarter-mile, the cab charges 10 cents (or $0.10) for each additional quarter-mile.

3. **Calculate Additional Quarter-Miles**: With the remaining $5.00, we need to calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can travel. Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so you can travel:
   \[
   \frac{5.00}{0.10} = 50 \text{ additional quarter-miles}

Let's denote:
- \( n \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( T \) as the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

Given:
- Sachin's current batting average before the finals is 51.
- In the finals, he scores 78 runs.
- After the finals, his batting average becomes 54.

The batting average is calculated as the total runs scored divided by the number of matches played.

1. **Calculate Total Runs Before Finals:**

   The batting average before the finals is given by:
   \[
   \frac{T}{n} = 51
   \]
   Therefore, the total runs before the finals is:
   \[
   T = 51n

1. **Single Letter Codes:**
   - If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book.
   - If we use \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes:**
   - If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book.
   - The order of letters in a pair does not matter, so each pair is a combination, not a permutation.
   - The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes:**
   - The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-of-letters codes: \( n + \binom{n}{2} \).

4. **Find the Smallest \( n \):**
   - We need at least 10 unique codes, so we solve for the smallest \( n \) such that:
     \[

D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - One gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{9\%} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - One gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{8\%} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Requirement:**
   - To ensure that both vitamin E and vitamin A requirements are met, we need to take the maximum of the two calculated values:
     - For vitamin E: 11.11 grams
     - For vitamin A: 12.5 grams
   - Therefore, the number of grams needed to meet both requirements is the maximum of these two values, which is 12.5 grams.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Determine the position of U:**
   Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST. Therefore:
   \[
   SU = \frac{ST}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11
   \]

3. **Find the position of S and T relative to R:**
   - Since RS = 5, point S is 5 units away from R.
   - Since RT = 17, point T is 17 units away from R.

4. **Determine the position of U relative to R:**
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, and SU = 11, we need to find RU.
   - We know that ST = 22, and since U is the midpoint, U is 11 units away from both S and T.
   - Since S is 5 units from R, and U is 11 units from S, we can find RU by adding the distance from R to S and S to U:
   \[
   RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16

5. **Check the calculation:**
   - We calculated RU as 16, but this does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate:
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, U is 11 units from both S and T.
   - Since S is 5 units from R, and U is 11 units from S, the correct calculation should be:
   \[
   RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16

6. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Let's consider the possibility of a mistake in understanding the problem. Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, U is 11 units from both S and T.
   - If we consider the entire line from R to T, which is 17, and subtract the distance from U to T (11), we get:

C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Discount**: 
   - The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items. 
   - This means the selling price is 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%).

2. **Express the Discounted Price**:
   - Let the original price of an item be \( P \).
   - The discounted price is \( 0.8P \) (since 80% of \( P \) is \( 0.8P \)).

3. **Determine the Required Increase**:
   - To return to the original price \( P \) from the discounted price \( 0.8P \), we need to find the percentage increase from \( 0.8P \) to \( P \).

4. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - The increase needed is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).

5. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - The percentage increase is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( s \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
   - The speed of the plane is \( 10s \) (10 times the speed of the ship).

2. **Time Relationship:**
   - The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts. 
   - The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is \( \frac{180}{s} \) hours.

3. **Distance Relationship:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance from the starting point where they meet.
   - The ship travels this distance \( d \) at speed \( s \), so the time taken by the ship to travel \( d \) miles is \( \frac{d}{s} \).
   - The plane travels the same distance \( d \) at speed \( 10s \), so the time taken by the plane to travel \( d \) miles is \( \frac{d}{10s} \).

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - Since the plane starts after the ship has traveled 180 miles, the time taken by the plane to meet the ship is the time taken by the ship to travel the remaining distance after 180 miles.
   - Therefore, the time taken by the plane to meet the ship is the same as the time taken by the ship to travel the remaining distance \( d - 180 \).
   - Thus, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{10s} = \frac{d - 180}{s}

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by \( 10s \) to eliminate the denominators:
     \[

4. **Population in two years:** Again, the population increases by 10% from the next year. Therefore, the population in two years will be:
   \[
   P_{\text{two years}} = P_{\text{next year}} \times 1.10 = P_{\text{now}} \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P_{\text{now}} \times 1.21
   \]

According to the problem, the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago:
\[
P_{\text{two years}} = 2P
\]

Substituting the expression for \( P_{\text{two years}} \):
\[
P_{\text{now}} \times 1.21 = 2P
\]

Solving for \( P_{\text{now}} \):
\[
P_{\text{now}} = \frac{2P}{1.21}
\]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from \( P \) to \( P_{\text{now}} \):
\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P_{\text{now}} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Substitute \( P_{\text{now}} = \frac{2P}{1.21} \):
\[
\text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{\frac{2P}{1.21} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
= \left(\frac{2P - 1.21P}{1.21P}\right) \times 100\%
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.79P}{1.21P}\right) \times 100\%
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.79}{1.21}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Calculate \( \frac{0.79}{1.21} \):
\[
\frac{0.79}{1.21} \approx 0.6529
\]

Convert to percentage:
\[
0.6529 \times 100\% \approx 65.29\%
\]

The closest option to 65.29% is 65%.

A)62, 35
B)62, 34
C)34, 62
D)42, 62
E)62, 42",B,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the amount of money Arjun has.
- \( S \) as the amount of money Sajal has.

**Step 1: Analyze the first condition.**

""If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.""

- After giving $30, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \).
- Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).

According to the condition:
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]
\[ S = 2A - 60 - 30 \]
\[ S = 2A - 90 \]  (Equation 1)

**Step 2: Analyze the second condition.**

""If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.""

- After giving $10, Sajal will have \( S - 10 \).
- Arjun will have \( A + 10 \).

According to the condition:
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]
\[ A = 3S - 30 - 10 \]
\[ A = 3S - 40 \]  (Equation 2)

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

We have two equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]

Simplify:
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]

Rearrange to solve for \( A \):
\[ 310 = 6A - A \]
\[ 310 = 5A \]
\[ A = \frac{310}{5} \]
\[ A = 62 \]

Now substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]
\[ S = 124 - 90 \]
\[ S = 34 \]

So, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**

- If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun will have \( 62 - 30 = 32 \) and Sajal will have \( 34 + 30 = 64 \). Indeed, 64 is twice 32.
- If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Sajal will have \( 34 - 10 = 24 \) and Arjun will have \( 62 + 10 = 72 \). Indeed, 72 is thrice 24.

The solution satisfies both conditions.

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

In this problem, we know:

- The width is 100 feet.
- The area is 3,000 square feet.

We need to find the length. Let's denote the length as \( L \).

Substitute the known values into the area formula:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

To solve for \( L \), divide both sides of the equation by 100:

E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - The area of the rectangle is \( s \times (s - 4) \).

4. **Relate the area of the rectangle to the triangles:**
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.
   - Therefore, the total area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

5. **Set up the equation for the area:**

6. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

Step 1: Understand the ratio.
- The original length of the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is now reduced to 3 parts.

Step 2: Set up the proportion.
- Let the original length of the ribbon be represented by 5 parts.
- The new length of the ribbon will be represented by 3 parts.

Step 3: Calculate the value of one part.
- The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, which corresponds to 5 parts.
- Therefore, the length of one part is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Length of one part} = \frac{\text{Original length}}{\text{Number of parts in original length}} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{5} = 6 \text{ cm}

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - \( M = abc \) is a three-digit number, which can be expressed as \( M = 100a + 10b + c \).
   - \( N = cba \) is another three-digit number, which can be expressed as \( N = 100c + 10b + a \).

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Expressing \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substituting into the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990

   99a + 297c = 990
   \]

6. **Dividing the Entire Equation by 99:**
   \[
   a + 3c = 10

7. **Finding Possible Values of \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we solve \( a + 3c = 10 \).
   - Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are:
     - \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit)
     - \( c = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
     - \( c = 2 \), \( a = 4 \)
     - \( c = 3 \), \( a = 1 \)

8. **Checking \( M > N \):**
   - For each valid pair \((a, c)\), check if \( M > N \).

   - **Pair (7, 1):**
     - \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 7 = 107 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is always true since \( 701 > 107 \).

   - **Pair (4, 2):**
     - \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 2 + 10b + 4 = 204 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is always true since \( 402 > 204 \).

   - **Pair (1, 3):**
     - \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)
     - \( N = 100 \times 3 + 10b + 1 = 301 + 10b \)
     - \( M > N \) is not true since \( 103 < 301 \).

9. **Counting Values of \( M \) Greater than 300:**
   - For pair (7, 1): \( M = 701 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
   - For pair (4, 2): \( M = 402 + 10b \), \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.

10. **Total Values of \( M \) Greater than 300:**
    - Total = 10 (from pair (7, 1)) + 10 (from pair (4, 2)) = 20.

D)700
E)none of these",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school, given that more than 501 students are in the school, and 20% took only physics while 28% took only math.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( N \).

1. **Condition 1**: \( N > 501 \).

2. **Condition 2**: 20% of the students took only physics. Therefore, the number of students who took only physics is \( 0.2N \).

3. **Condition 3**: 28% of the students took only math. Therefore, the number of students who took only math is \( 0.28N \).

Since the number of students must be a whole number, both \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) must be integers. This implies that \( N \) must be a multiple of both the denominators of these percentages when expressed as fractions.

- \( 0.2 = \frac{1}{5} \), so \( N \) must be a multiple of 5.
- \( 0.28 = \frac{7}{25} \), so \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

Now, we need to find the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501.

- The smallest multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525.

Let's check if 525 satisfies the conditions:

   - Raj's age 5 years ago = 17 - 5 = 12 years.

3. **Understand the relationship between Raj's and Rahim's ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, Raj's age 5 years ago = \(\frac{1}{3}\) of Rahim's age 5 years ago.

C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area.

1. **Determine the grazing area:**
   - The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - Here, \( r = 14 \) feet, so the area \( A \) is:
     \[
     A = \pi \times (14)^2 = \pi \times 196

2. **Calculate the number of days to graze the entire area:**
   - The cow grazes 10 square feet per day.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

Step 1: Determine the cost price of the book.
- The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%.
- Let the cost price be Rs. C.
- Profit is 10% of the cost price, so the selling price is given by:
  \[
  \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C
  \]
- We know the selling price is Rs. 27.50, so:
  \[
  1.10C = 27.50
  \]
- Solving for C:
  \[
  C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
  \]
- Therefore, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

Step 2: Calculate the profit or loss if the book is sold for Rs. 25.75.
- New selling price = Rs. 25.75
- Cost price = Rs. 25.00
- Profit or Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75

Step 3: Determine the percentage of profit or loss.
- Since the selling price (Rs. 25.75) is greater than the cost price (Rs. 25.00), there is a profit.
- Profit percentage is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 = 3\%

Step 1: Calculate the total number of arrangements of the three children.
- There are 3 children, and we want to arrange them in a line. The number of ways to arrange 3 distinct children is given by the factorial of 3, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.

Step 2: Determine the condition where Susan is to the left of Tim.
- For any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim.
- Since there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim in any arrangement, exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We have two equations:
1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

To find \( V \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Using the first equation:
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800

\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

92,,"Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after they begin rotating.

1. **Determine the time for one full rotation for each ball:**
   - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball A is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of A} = \frac{26 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball B is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of B} = \frac{35 \text{ minutes}}{5} = 7 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**
   - We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.
   - Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the LCM into hours and minutes:**
   - 91 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes because:
     \[
     91 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 31 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 31 \text{ minutes}

A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
   - Let \( y \) be the amount each friend was originally supposed to contribute.

2. **Initial Equation:**
   - The total planned expenditure on eatables is Rs. 96.
   - Therefore, the equation for the original plan is:
     \[
     x \times y = 96
     \]

3. **Change in Plan:**
   - Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).
   - Each of these friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the new contribution per friend is \( y + 4 \).

4. **New Equation:**
   - The total expenditure remains Rs. 96, so the equation for the new plan is:
     \[
     (x - 4) \times (y + 4) = 96
     \]

5. **Set Up the System of Equations:**
   - From the initial equation: \( xy = 96 \)
   - From the new equation: \((x - 4)(y + 4) = 96\)

6. **Expand the New Equation:**
   - Expanding the new equation gives:
     \[
     xy + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96
     \]
   - Substitute \( xy = 96 \) into the equation:
     \[
     96 + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     4x - 4y = 16
     \]
   - Divide the entire equation by 4:
     \[
     x - y = 4
     \]

7. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( xy = 96 \)
     2. \( x - y = 4 \)

   - From the second equation, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
     \[
     x = y + 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = y + 4 \) into the first equation:
     \[
     (y + 4)y = 96
     \]
     \[
     y^2 + 4y = 96
     \]
     \[
     y^2 + 4y - 96 = 0
     \]

8. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1, b = 4, c = -96 \):
     \[
     y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-96)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{-4 \pm 20}{2}
     \]

   - Calculate the roots:
     - \( y = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
     - \( y = \frac{-24}{2} = -12 \) (not possible since contribution cannot be negative)

9. **Find \( x \):**
   - Since \( y = 8 \), substitute back to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = y + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
     \]

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Calculate the total amount for sons: \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).
   - Calculate the total amount for daughters: \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
   - Calculate the total amount for nephews: \( 2 \times x = 2x \).
   - Combine these to form the equation:
     \[
     25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Convert the common difference to years:**
   - The common difference is given as 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, 3 months is equivalent to \( \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) years.

2. **Define the terms of the A.P.:**
   - Let the number of members in the club be \( n \).
   - The age of the youngest member (first term of the A.P.) is 7 years.
   - The ages of the members form an A.P.: 7, \( 7 + \frac{1}{4} \), \( 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4} \), ..., \( 7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Sum of the A.P.:**
   - The sum of the ages of all members is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - The sum of the ages is given as 250 years:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} \times \left(7 + \left(7 + (n-1) \times \frac{1}{4}\right)\right) = 250

   - Simplify:
     \[
     n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0

   - Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 56 \), and \( c = -2000 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 56^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3136 + 8000 = 11136
     \]
   - Calculate \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 \pm \sqrt{11136}}{2}
     \]
   - Approximate \( \sqrt{11136} \approx 105.5 \).
   - Calculate the positive root:
     \[
     n = \frac{-56 + 105.5}{2} \approx \frac{49.5}{2} \approx 24.75

   - Since \( n \) must be an integer, check the closest integer values.

7. **Check integer solutions:**
   - Check \( n = 25 \):
     \[
     n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 25^2 + 56 \times 25 - 2000 = 625 + 1400 - 2000 = 25

1. **Initial Contribution per Man:**
   - Originally, there are M men contributing to the purchase of a gift costing Rs. D.
   - The contribution per man initially is \( \frac{D}{M} \).

2. **New Contribution per Man:**
   - If 3 men drop out, the number of men left is \( M - 3 \).
   - The new contribution per man is \( \frac{D}{M-3} \).

3. **Additional Contribution Required:**
   - The additional contribution required per man is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution.
   - This is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Additional Contribution} = \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M}

   - Time taken to catch up = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{32 \text{ kmph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train 'B' leaves at 2 pm.
   - It takes 3.75 hours for Train 'B' to catch up to Train 'A'.
   - 3.75 hours is equivalent to 3 hours and 45 minutes.

105,,"Mark told John ""If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, ""if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
A)22
B)60
C)28
D)26
E)18",B,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as \( M \) and the amount of money John has as \( J \).

2. According to Mark, if John gives him half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. This can be written as:
   \[
   M + \frac{J}{2} = 75
   \]

3. According to John, if Mark gives him one third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. This can be written as:
   \[
   J + \frac{M}{3} = 75
   \]

Now, we have two equations:
\[
1) \quad M + \frac{J}{2} = 75
\]
\[
2) \quad J + \frac{M}{3} = 75
\]

Let's solve these equations step-by-step:

**Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( M \):**

From equation 1:
\[
M = 75 - \frac{J}{2}
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( M \) in Equation 2:**

Substitute \( M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \) into equation 2:
\[
J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{J}{2}) = 75
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the Equation:**

Distribute \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
J + \frac{75}{3} - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]

Simplify \(\frac{75}{3}\):
\[
J + 25 - \frac{J}{6} = 75
\]

**Step 4: Combine Like Terms:**

Multiply the entire equation by 6 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
6J + 150 - J = 450
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5J + 150 = 450
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( J \):**

Subtract 150 from both sides:
\[
5J = 300
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
J = 60
\]

Therefore, John had Rs. 60. The correct option is:

A)15
B)28
C)30
D)53
E)59",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the doubling process of the water lilies and how it affects the time it takes to cover the lake.

1. **Initial Condition**: We know that with 1 water lily, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered.

2. **Doubling Process**: The number of water lilies doubles every 2 days. This means that if the lake is fully covered on day 60, then on day 58, it was half-covered, on day 56, it was a quarter-covered, and so on.

3. **Determine the Day for 64 Lilies**:
   - We need to find out how many days before the lake is fully covered when starting with 64 lilies instead of 1.
   - Since the number of lilies doubles every 2 days, we can calculate how many times 1 lily needs to double to reach 64 lilies:
     - \(1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 8 \to 16 \to 32 \to 64\)
   - This is 6 doublings (since \(2^6 = 64\)).

4. **Calculate the Days**:
   - Each doubling takes 2 days, so 6 doublings take \(6 \times 2 = 12\) days.
   - If starting with 1 lily takes 60 days to cover the lake, starting with 64 lilies means we are 12 days ahead in the doubling process.
   - Therefore, the lake will be fully covered in \(60 - 12 = 48\) days.

E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work they can complete.

1. **Initial Scenario:**
   - We have \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day.
   - They complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days.

   The total amount of work done can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total work} = (\text{Number of men}) \times (\text{Hours per day}) \times (\text{Number of days})

Let's break down the information given:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

First, let's determine the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither, the remaining 80% take at least one type of vacation (either winter, summer, or both).

Next, we know that 75% take a winter vacation. This includes those who take both winter and summer vacations. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is:

\[ \text{Only Winter} = \text{Winter} - \text{Both} = 75\% - 40\% = 35\% \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one vacation and 20% take neither, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation is:

\[ \text{Summer} = 80\% - \text{Only Winter} = 80\% - 35\% = 45\% \]

Finally, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:

\[ \text{Only Summer} = \text{Summer} - \text{Both} = 45\% - 40\% = 5\% \]

In this problem:
- \(\text{Base}_1\) (the top width) = 10 m

2. **Understand the percentage of matches lost:**
   - The team lost 30% of their matches.

3. **Set up an equation to find the total number of matches:**

Step 1: Calculate the number of revolutions in 30 seconds.
- The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute.
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is:
  \[
  \text{Revolutions in 30 seconds} = \frac{300 \text{ revolutions}}{60 \text{ seconds}} \times 30 \text{ seconds} = 150 \text{ revolutions}

The expression for \( x \) is:

\[
x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4

Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as a perfect square:

\[
(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2 = n^2 + 8n\sqrt{n} + 16n + 16

However, this doesn't match exactly with our numerator. Let's try another approach by factoring:

The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[

Thus, the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[
x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n})^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}

Calculate the minimum and maximum values of \( y \):

- When \( n = 36 \), \( y = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} = 36 + 24 = 60 \).
- When \( n = 72 \), \( y = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} = 72 + 24 = 96 \).

Now, calculate \( x \) for these values of \( y \):

1. For \( y = 60 \):

\[
x = \frac{60^2}{60 + 4} = \frac{3600}{64} = 56.25

2. For \( y = 96 \):

\[
x = \frac{96^2}{96 + 4} = \frac{9216}{100} = 92.16

1. **Determine the time each partner's investment was in the business:**
   - A started the business with Rs.40,000 and was in the business for the entire year (12 months).
   - B joined after 2 months, so B was in the business for 10 months (12 - 2 = 10 months).
   - Let C join x months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, C joined after (2 + x) months from the start. Therefore, C was in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) months.

2. **Calculate the effective capital for each partner:**
   - A's effective capital = 40,000 * 12
   - B's effective capital = 60,000 * 10
   - C's effective capital = 120,000 * (12 - (2 + x))

   - The total profit is Rs.375,000, and C's share is Rs.150,000.
   - The ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 2/5.
   - Therefore, C's effective capital should be 2/5 of the total effective capital of A, B, and C combined.

4. **Express the total effective capital:**

1. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   - The side of the square is given as 20 cm.
   - The area of a square is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area of square} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2

   - The radius of the semi-circle is half of the diameter: 
     \[
     \text{Radius} = \frac{20 \, \text{cm}}{2} = 10 \, \text{cm}

3. **Calculate the total area of the two semi-circles:**
   - Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is:

4. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the total area of the semi-circles from the area of the square:
     \[
     \text{Area of remaining paper} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2

5. **Approximate the value of \(\pi\):**
   - Use \(\pi \approx 3.14\) for approximation:
     \[
     100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314 \, \text{cm}^2

6. **Final calculation:**
   - Subtract the approximate area of the semi-circles from the area of the square:
     \[
     \text{Area of remaining paper} = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 - 314 \, \text{cm}^2 = 86 \, \text{cm}^2

E)None of the above",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between points A and B. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Journey:**
   - Kevin drives from A to B at 70 mph.
   - He returns from B to A at 90 mph.
   - 3 hours before the end of his trip, he is 70 miles away from B.

2. **Analyzing the Information:**
   - 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin is still approaching B, 70 miles away from it.
   - Since he is approaching B, he is still on his way to B, not on his return trip to A.

3. **Calculate the Time to Reach B:**
   - If Kevin is 70 miles away from B and traveling at 70 mph, it will take him 1 hour to reach B (since distance = speed × time, or time = distance/speed = 70 miles / 70 mph = 1 hour).

Let's denote:
- \( v_b \) as the man's rowing speed in still water (4 kmph).
- \( v_c \) as the speed of the current.
- \( v_{against} \) as the man's speed against the current (2 kmph).

A)368
B)377
C)288
D)997
E)112",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define the digits of the number:**
   Let the three-digit number be represented as \( \overline{abc} \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the digits of the number. Here, \( a \) is the hundreds digit, \( b \) is the tens digit, and \( c \) is the units digit.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:**
   - The sum of the digits is 17: 
     \[
     a + b + c = 17
     \]
   - The sum of the squares of the digits is 109:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
     \]
   - Subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse of the number:
     \[
     100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
     \]

3. **Simplify the equation from the subtraction condition:**
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   99a - 99c = 495
   \]
   Dividing through by 99:
   \[
   a - c = 5

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   We have three equations now:
   \[
   a + b + c = 17
   \]
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
   \]
   \[
   a - c = 5
   \]

   From \( a - c = 5 \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
   \[
   a = c + 5
   \]

   Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   (c + 5) + b + c = 17
   \]
   \[
   2c + b = 12

   So, \( b = 12 - 2c \).

5. **Substitute into the second equation:**
   \[
   (c + 5)^2 + (12 - 2c)^2 + c^2 = 109

   Expanding each term:
   \[
   (c^2 + 10c + 25) + (144 - 48c + 4c^2) + c^2 = 109

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   6c^2 - 38c + 169 = 109

   Simplify:
   \[
   6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0
   \]
   Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve the quadratic equation:**
   Using the quadratic formula \( c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 3, b = -19, c = 30 \):
   \[
   c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{(-19)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 30}}{6}

   \[
   c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{361 - 360}}{6}

   \[
   c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}

   \[
   c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad c = \frac{18}{6} = 3

   - If \( n = 3 \) (odd), the middle income is $3000. The total income would be $3000 + x + y = $9000, where \( x \) and \( y \) are the other two incomes. This is possible.
   - If \( n = 4 \) (even), the average of the two middle incomes is $3000. This means the sum of the two middle incomes is $6000. The total income would be $6000 + x + y = $9000, where \( x \) and \( y \) are the other two incomes. This is also possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - For \( n = 3 \), the incomes could be $3000, $3000, and $3000, which sums to $9000.
   - For \( n = 4 \), the incomes could be $3000, $3000, $1500, and $1500, which also sums to $9000.

Since the problem states that the median income is $3000, and we have found that both 3 and 4 members satisfy the conditions, we need to choose the smallest possible number of members that fits the problem's conditions.

A)3267
B)2678
C)2797
D)2300
E)2781",D,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
   - Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Number of voters not eligible = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Determine the number of votes the winning candidate received:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - Since there are two candidates, the winning candidate received more than half of the eligible votes by 15%.
   - Half of the eligible votes = 4,000 / 2 = 2,000
   - Additional 15% of the eligible votes = 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600
   - Total votes received by the winning candidate = Half of the eligible votes + Additional votes = 2,000 + 600 = 2,600

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - The winning candidate received 2,600 votes.
   - The losing candidate received the remaining votes: 4,000 - 2,600 = 1,400
   - The difference in votes between the winning and losing candidate is 2,600 - 1,400 = 1,200
   - 1,200 is indeed 15% of 4,000, confirming our calculation.

Therefore, the total number of votes the winning candidate got is 2,600.

However, none of the given options match this result. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- The winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes, not just the eligible votes.

136,,"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
A)4
B)3
C)2
D)1
E)0",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought up to earn exactly $3.40, given the payment rates for copper and brass coins.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.
- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The diver earns:
- 20 cents for each copper coin, so \( 20x \) cents for \( x \) copper coins.
- 25 cents for each brass coin, so \( 25y \) cents for \( y \) brass coins.

The total earnings from one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) (the number of copper coins) that satisfies this equation with non-negative integer values for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:
\[ 4x + 5y = 68 \]

Now, solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 5y = 68 - 4x \]
\[ y = \frac{68 - 4x}{5} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 68 - 4x \) must be divisible by 5. Let's find the smallest \( x \) such that this condition holds.

Check values of \( x \) starting from 0:

1. \( x = 0 \):
   \[ 68 - 4(0) = 68 \]
   \[ \frac{68}{5} = 13.6 \] (not an integer)

2. \( x = 1 \):
   \[ 68 - 4(1) = 64 \]
   \[ \frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \] (not an integer)

3. \( x = 2 \):
   \[ 68 - 4(2) = 60 \]
   \[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \] (integer)

Since \( y = 12 \) is an integer when \( x = 2 \), this is the minimum number of copper coins that satisfies the equation.

A)1 hr 23 min
B)1 hr 15 min
C)1 hr 8 min
D)56 min
E)55 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when the two trains will meet each other. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the travel times and speeds of the trains:**
   - Train M travels from City A to City B, leaving at 5 am and arriving at 9 am. This means Train M takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B.
   - Train N travels from City B to City A, leaving at 7 am and arriving at 10:30 am. This means Train N takes 3.5 hours to travel from City B to City A.

2. **Calculate the relative speed of the trains:**
   - Since both trains are traveling towards each other, we can add their speeds to find the relative speed. However, we don't have the actual speeds, but we can use the time taken to travel the entire distance.
   - Let the distance between City A and City B be D.
   - Speed of Train M = D/4 (since it takes 4 hours to cover distance D)
   - Speed of Train N = D/3.5 (since it takes 3.5 hours to cover distance D)
   - Relative speed = (D/4) + (D/3.5)

3. **Determine the time when Train N starts:**
   - Train M starts at 5 am, and Train N starts at 7 am. Therefore, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours by the time Train N starts.

4. **Calculate the distance covered by Train M in 2 hours:**
   - Distance covered by Train M in 2 hours = 2 * (D/4) = D/2

5. **Calculate the remaining distance to be covered when Train N starts:**
   - Remaining distance = D - D/2 = D/2

6. **Calculate the time taken for the trains to meet:**
   - Time taken to meet = Remaining distance / Relative speed
   - Time taken to meet = (D/2) / [(D/4) + (D/3.5)]
   - Simplifying the relative speed: (D/4) + (D/3.5) = (7D + 8D) / 28 = 15D/28
   - Time taken to meet = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/15D) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours

7. **Convert the time taken to meet into minutes:**
   - 14/15 hours = 14/15 * 60 minutes = 56 minutes

A)1 minute
B)2 minutes
C)3 minutes
D)4 minutes
E)5 minutes",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile.

1. **Determine the rate at which they collectively bike:**
   - Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour.
   - Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour.
   - Together, their combined biking rate is \(10 + 20 = 30\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to bike 1 mile collectively:**
   - Since they bike at a combined rate of 30 miles per hour, we need to find out how long it takes to bike 1 mile.
   - The formula to calculate time is: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Here, the distance is 1 mile and the rate is 30 miles per hour.
   - So, the time it takes is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours}

2. **Converted Scenario:**
   - The maximum marks M are converted to 800 marks.
   - The candidate would have secured 420 marks out of 800.

3. **Setting up the Proportion:**
   - The candidate's performance can be expressed as a proportion in both scenarios.
   - The proportion of marks secured in the original scenario is \(\frac{504}{M}\).
   - The proportion of marks secured in the converted scenario is \(\frac{420}{800}\).

4. **Equating the Proportions:**
   - Since the candidate's performance is the same in both scenarios, we equate the two proportions:
   \[

C)4m
D)4.2m
E)4.4m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   - The ratio of the height of the room (h) to its semi-perimeter (s) is given as 2:5. This means:
     \[
     \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls**:
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters.
   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total length of paper used is:
     \[
     \text{Total length of paper} = \frac{260}{2} = 130 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Area of the Walls**:
   - The area of the walls that needs to be papered is the total area minus the area for doors and windows.
   - Let the total area of the walls be \( A \).
   - The area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
   - Therefore, the area to be papered is:
     \[
     A - 15 = \text{Area covered by paper}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Area Covered by Paper**:
   - The paper is 0.5 meters wide, and the total length used is 130 meters.
   - Therefore, the area covered by the paper is:
     \[
     0.5 \times 130 = 65 \text{ sq.m}
     \]
   - So, the total area of the walls is:
     \[
     A = 65 + 15 = 80 \text{ sq.m}
     \]

5. **Relating Area to Dimensions**:
   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room times the height:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} \times h = 80
     \]
   - The semi-perimeter \( s \) is half of the perimeter, so:
     \[
     2s \times h = 80
     \]
   - Substituting \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \) into the equation:
     \[
     2s \times \frac{2}{5} \times s = 80
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} s^2 = 80

   - Solving for \( s^2 \):
     \[
     s^2 = \frac{80 \times 5}{4} = 100

     \[
     k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Key Speakers:**
   - We have three key speakers: pm, mp, and mla.
   - The condition is that pm must speak before mp, and mp must speak before mla.

2. **Total Number of Arrangements Without Restrictions:**
   - If there were no restrictions, the 10 speakers could be arranged in any order, which is \(10!\) (factorial of 10).

3. **Account for the Restrictions:**
   - The restriction is that pm must speak before mp, and mp must speak before mla.
   - For any specific arrangement of the 10 speakers, the three key speakers (pm, mp, mla) can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) (factorial of 3) different ways.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the original price of each article be \( x \).

2. **Price Decrease:**
   - The price of each article decreased by 15%, so the new price of each article is \( x - 0.15x = 0.85x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means the number of articles she can buy at the new price is 5 more than the number she could buy at the original price.

1. **Initial Positions:**
   - Neha is 12th from the left end.
   - Radha is 6th from the right end.

2. **Shifting Positions:**
   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is 6 + 2 = 8th from the right end.
   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is 12 + 2 = 14th from the left end.

3. **Children Between Neha and Radha:**

A)10/7
B)20/7
C)30/7
D)40/7
E)50/7",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the original mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve a mixture with equal parts sand and clay.

1. **Initial Composition:**
   - The original mixture is 10 kg.
   - It contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
   - Therefore, the amount of sand in the mixture is \(0.3 \times 10 = 3\) kg.
   - The amount of clay in the mixture is \(0.7 \times 10 = 7\) kg.

2. **Desired Composition:**
   - We want the final mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay.
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of the mixture we remove and replace with pure sand.
   - After removing \(x\) kg of the mixture, the remaining mixture is \(10 - x\) kg.

3. **Composition After Removal:**
   - The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is \((10 - x) \times 0.3\).
   - The amount of clay in the remaining mixture is \((10 - x) \times 0.7\).

4. **Adding Pure Sand:**
   - We add \(x\) kg of pure sand to the remaining mixture.
   - The total amount of sand becomes \((10 - x) \times 0.3 + x\).
   - The total amount of clay remains \((10 - x) \times 0.7\).

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We want the amounts of sand and clay to be equal:

B)62.5%
C)63.5%
D)64.5%
E)65.5%",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's new expenditure after his income increases by 20%.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Income and Expenditure:**
   - Let the man's initial income be \( I \).
   - His initial expenditure is 70% of his income, which is \( 0.7I \).

2. **Income Increase:**
   - His income increases by 20%.
   - The new income is \( I + 0.2I = 1.2I \).

3. **New Expenditure:**
   - Since he spends 70% of his income, his new expenditure will be 70% of his new income.
   - New expenditure = 70% of \( 1.2I \) = \( 0.7 \times 1.2I = 0.84I \).

4. **Percentage of New Expenditure Relative to Original Income:**
   - We need to find the percentage of the new expenditure relative to the original income \( I \).
   - The new expenditure as a percentage of the original income is \( \frac{0.84I}{I} \times 100\% = 84\% \).

The problem asks for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, not the original income. Therefore, we need to calculate:

5. **New Expenditure as a Percentage of New Income:**
   - New expenditure = \( 0.84I \)
   - New income = \( 1.2I \)
   - New expenditure as a percentage of new income = \( \frac{0.84I}{1.2I} \times 100\% = \frac{0.84}{1.2} \times 100\% \)

6. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   - \( \frac{0.84}{1.2} = 0.7 \)

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each number.

- For 28:
  - 28 is divisible by 2: 28 ÷ 2 = 14
  - 14 is divisible by 2: 14 ÷ 2 = 7
  - 7 is a prime number.
  - So, the prime factorization of 28 is \(2^2 \times 7\).

- For 98:
  - 98 is divisible by 2: 98 ÷ 2 = 49
  - 49 is divisible by 7: 49 ÷ 7 = 7
  - 7 is a prime number.
  - So, the prime factorization of 98 is \(2^1 \times 7^2\).

Step 2: Identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers.

- The common prime factors of 28 and 98 are 2 and 7.
- The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \(2^1\).
- The lowest power of 7 in both factorizations is \(7^1\).

Step 3: Calculate the GCD by multiplying these lowest powers together.

- GCD = \(2^1 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

Given:
1. \( x < 0 \)
2. \( y > 0 \)
3. \( |x^3| > |y^2| \)

Let's break down each condition:

1. \( x < 0 \): This means \( x \) is a negative number.
2. \( y > 0 \): This means \( y \) is a positive number.
3. \( |x^3| > |y^2| \): This means the absolute value of \( x^3 \) is greater than the absolute value of \( y^2 \).

Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^3 \) will also be negative (because a negative number raised to an odd power remains negative). Therefore, \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).

Since \( y > 0 \), \( y^2 \) will be positive, and \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

The inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) becomes:

A) \( x > y \): Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( x \) cannot be greater than \( y \). This option is false.

B) \( y^2 > x^2 \): Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we cannot directly compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) without additional information. This option is not necessarily true.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin lands on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin lands on tails.

We know the total number of flips is 20, so:
\[ H + T = 20 \]

For each head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, so the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is:
\[ 2H \]

For each tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is:
\[ 3T \]

Since neither won or lost any money, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan must equal the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

We can solve this system of equations step-by-step:

From equation 2, express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute \( T = \frac{2H}{3} \) into equation 1:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{3H}{3} + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the cost of repairing to the cost of purchasing new tires.

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - The cost of new tires is $180 per tire.
   - New tires last for 4 years.
   - Therefore, the average cost per year for new tires is:
     \[
     \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires:**
   - The cost of repairing current tires is $40 per tire.
   - Repairs make the tires last for 1 additional year.
   - Therefore, the average cost per year for repairing is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage increase from repairing to purchasing new tires:**
   - The difference in cost per year between new tires and repaired tires is:
     \[
     45 - 40 = 5 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]
   - To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Cost}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Here, the original cost is the cost of repairing, which is $40 per year. So, the percentage increase is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{5}{40}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%
     \]

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

A)$5102
B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on a bond with a principal amount of $5,000, an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded semi-annually, over a period of 1 year.

Step 1: Identify the principal amount (P), which is $5,000.

Step 2: Identify the annual interest rate (r), which is 12%. Convert this percentage to a decimal for calculation purposes: 12% = 0.12.

Step 3: Determine the compounding frequency. Since the interest is compounded every six months, it is compounded semi-annually. This means there are 2 compounding periods per year.

Step 4: Calculate the interest rate per compounding period. Since the annual rate is 12% and there are 2 periods per year, the rate per period is:
\[ \text{Interest rate per period} = \frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06 \]

Step 5: Determine the number of compounding periods (n). Since the bond is for 1 year and compounds semi-annually, there are 2 periods:
\[ n = 2 \]

Step 6: Use the compound interest formula to calculate the total amount (A) at maturity:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
Where:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \)
- \( n = 2 \)
- \( t = 1 \) (since the bond is for 1 year)

Plug these values into the formula:
\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]
\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^2 \]
\[ A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 \]
\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]
\[ A = 5618 \]

Step 7: Calculate the interest accrued by subtracting the principal from the total amount:
\[ \text{Interest} = A - P \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 5618 - 5000 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 618 \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618.

```
  M A D

-------------
  M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D
```

We need to find the digits that correspond to the letters M, A, D, B, E, R, and I such that the multiplication is correct.

Step 1: Analyze the structure of the multiplication.
- The number ""MAD"" is multiplied by ""BE"" to give the result ""AMID"".
- The partial products are ""MAD"" and ""RAE"".

Step 2: Consider the possible values for M.
- Since ""MAD"" is a three-digit number and ""AMID"" is a four-digit number, M must be 9 (the only digit that can make a three-digit number into a four-digit number when multiplied by a two-digit number).

Step 3: Substitute M = 9 and analyze further.
- The number ""MAD"" becomes ""9AD"".
- The number ""AMID"" becomes ""9AID"".

Step 4: Consider the possible values for B.
- Since ""BE"" is a two-digit number, B can be any digit from 1 to 9.

Step 5: Analyze the multiplication.
- The first partial product is ""9AD"", which is ""9AD × 1"".
- The second partial product is ""RAE"", which is ""9AD × E"".

Step 6: Consider the possible values for A.
- Since ""AMID"" starts with 9, A must be 2 (since 9 × 2 = 18, which is the only way to have a carry that results in a number starting with 9).

Step 7: Substitute A = 2 and analyze further.
- The number ""9AD"" becomes ""92D"".
- The number ""9AID"" becomes ""92ID"".

Step 8: Consider the possible values for D.
- Since ""92D"" is a three-digit number, D can be any digit from 0 to 9.

Step 9: Analyze the multiplication.
- The first partial product is ""92D"", which is ""92D × 1"".
- The second partial product is ""RAE"", which is ""92D × E"".

Step 10: Consider the possible values for E.
- Since ""BE"" is a two-digit number, E can be any digit from 0 to 9.

Step 11: Solve for the correct combination.
- By testing the possible values, we find that when D = 0, B = 9, and E = 9, the multiplication works out correctly.

Therefore, the correct combination is:
M = 9, A = 2, D = 0, B = 9, E = 9, R = 8, I = 1.

The number ""MAD"" is 920, and the number ""BE"" is 99. The multiplication 920 × 99 gives the result 92079, which matches the structure of ""AMID"".

A)18
B)25
C)15
D)20
E)21",D,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ajay's current age based on the information given about Sachin's age.

1. **Determine Sachin's current age:**
   - We know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.
   - Therefore, Sachin's current age is \(40 - 10 = 30\) years.

2. **Determine Sachin's age 10 years ago:**
   - Since Sachin is currently 30 years old, 10 years ago he was \(30 - 10 = 20\) years old.

3. **Relate Sachin's age to Ajay's age 10 years ago:**
   - The problem states that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.
   - Let Ajay's age 10 years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, Sachin's age 10 years ago (20 years) is twice Ajay's age 10 years ago: \(20 = 2x\).

4. **Solve for Ajay's age 10 years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{2} = 10

D)Cannot be determined
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot and then calculate the cost of gardening that area.

Step 1: Understand the problem
- We have a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres.
- There is a 1-metre broad boundary around this plot.
- We need to find the cost of gardening this boundary at a rate of 10 per square metre.

Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the plot
- The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( P = 2(l + w) \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
- We know \( P = 340 \) metres, so \( 2(l + w) = 340 \).
- Simplifying, we get \( l + w = 170 \).

Step 3: Calculate the area of the boundary
- The boundary is 1 metre wide around the entire plot.
- The outer dimensions of the plot including the boundary will be \( (l + 2) \) and \( (w + 2) \).
- The area of the plot including the boundary is \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \).
- The area of the plot itself is \( l \times w \).

Step 4: Calculate the area of the boundary
- The area of the boundary is the difference between the area of the plot including the boundary and the area of the plot itself.
- Area of the boundary = \( (l + 2)(w + 2) - l \times w \).

Step 5: Simplify the expression
- Expanding \( (l + 2)(w + 2) \), we get:
  \[
  (l + 2)(w + 2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4
  \]
- Therefore, the area of the boundary is:
  \[
  (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) - lw = 2l + 2w + 4

- We know \( l + w = 170 \), so:
  \[
  2l + 2w = 2 \times 170 = 340

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
A)43 seconds
B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.

1. **Understand the problem**: The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means the front of the train takes 3 seconds to reach the end of the tunnel. The tunnel is 1 mile long, and the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.

2. **Convert the speed**: The train's speed is given in miles per hour, but we need to work in seconds. Convert 120 miles per hour to miles per second:
   \[
   \text{Speed in miles per second} = \frac{120 \text{ miles per hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds per hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the train**: Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, the length of the train can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Length of the train} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second} \times 3 \text{ seconds} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance to be covered**: To completely pass through the tunnel, the train must cover the length of the tunnel plus its own length:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 1 \text{ mile (tunnel)} + \frac{1}{10} \text{ mile (train)} = \frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}

5. **Calculate the total time to pass through the tunnel**: Using the speed of the train, calculate the time it takes to cover the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second}} = \frac{11}{10} \times 30 = 33 \text{ seconds}

A)247.67
B)237.67
C)227.67
D)215.67
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered on the invoice.

1. **Understanding the Terms:**
   - The invoice amount is $20,000.
   - The terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

2. **Calculate the Discount:**
   - A 4% discount on $20,000 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.04 \times 20,000 = 800
     \]
   - Therefore, if the merchant pays within 30 days, he only needs to pay:
     \[
     20,000 - 800 = 19,200
     \]

3. **Determine the Savings:**
   - By paying $19,200 instead of $20,000, the merchant saves $800.

4. **Calculate the Time Period:**
   - The merchant has 100 days to pay the full amount, but he can pay the discounted amount in 30 days. Therefore, the time period for which he needs to borrow the money is:
     \[
     100 - 30 = 70 \text{ days}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Simple Interest Rate:**
   - The merchant saves $800 by paying early. We need to find the interest rate that would make borrowing $19,200 for 70 days cost exactly $800 in interest.
   - Using the simple interest formula:
     \[
     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Here, the interest is $800, the principal is $19,200, and the time is 70 days (converted to years as \(\frac{70}{365}\)).
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:
     \[
     800 = 19,200 \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{70}{365}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70}

Step 1: Determine the total number of parts in the mixture.
- The total number of parts is the sum of the parts of rice, wheat, and corn: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts.

Step 2: Determine the weight of one part of the mixture.
- We know that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, which corresponds to 2 parts of the mixture.
- Therefore, the weight of one part is 3 pounds / 2 parts = 1.5 pounds per part.

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the corn in the mixture.
- Corn corresponds to 5 parts of the mixture.

A)500
B)600
C)750
D)800
E)900",E,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the cost of one soda in cents.
- \( e \) as the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. One soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents:
   \[
   s + 2e = 150
   \]

2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents:
   \[
   2s + 3e = 300
   \]

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is represented by the expression \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( e \).

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):
\[
2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150
\]
\[
2s + 4e = 300
\]

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:
\[
(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300
\]
\[
2s + 4e - 2s - 3e = 0
\]
\[
e = 0
\]

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the first equation:
\[
s + 2(0) = 150
\]
\[
s = 150
\]

Now we know:
- \( s = 150 \)
- \( e = 0 \)

Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:
\[
6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0)
\]
\[
6s + 7e = 900 + 0

\[
6s + 7e = 900

A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen given the conditions provided.

1. **Determine the number of pens produced:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company needs to produce more than 7200 pens to account for the defective ones.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens produced.
   - 90% of the produced pens are non-defective, so:
     \[
     0.9x = 7200
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]
   - Therefore, the company produces 8000 pens.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue from selling 7200 pens is:
     \[
     7200 \times 10 = 72000 \text{ Rs.}
     \]

3. **Determine the total cost and profit:**
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens.
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost, so:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 0.25C
     \]
   - The total revenue is the sum of the total cost and the profit:
     \[
     72000 = C + 0.25C = 1.25C

   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{72000}{1.25} = 57600 \text{ Rs.}

4. **Calculate the manufacturing cost per pen:**
   - The total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is 57600 Rs.
   - Therefore, the manufacturing cost per pen is:

A)12
B)24
C)42
D)48
E)49",B,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define the digits:**
   - Let the digit in the ten's place be \( x \).
   - Then the digit in the unit's place is \( 2x \) (since it is double the ten's place digit).

2. **Form the two-digit number:**
   - The two-digit number can be expressed as \( 10x + 2x = 12x \).

3. **Sum of the digits:**
   - The sum of the digits is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, the two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
   \[
   12x = 3x + 18
   \]

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
   \[
   12x - 3x = 18
   \]
   \[
   9x = 18
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

6. **Find the number:**
   - If \( x = 2 \), then the digit in the ten's place is 2, and the digit in the unit's place is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the number is \( 10 \times 2 + 4 = 24 \).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - The sum of the digits is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

E)None",D,"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expressions L(x, y) and R(x, y) and determine the relationship between them for positive real numbers x and y.

1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**
   - The floor function [x] gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
   - For example, [3.7] = 3 and [2] = 2.

2. **Expression for L(x, y):**
   - L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
   - This means we take the floor of x, the floor of y, and the floor of (x + y), and then sum them.

3. **Expression for R(x, y):**
   - R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]
   - This means we take the floor of 2x and the floor of 2y, and then sum them.

4. **Analyzing L(x, y) and R(x, y):**
   - Consider x = a + ε and y = b + δ, where a and b are integers, and 0 ≤ ε, δ < 1.

   - R(x, y) = [2a + 2ε] + [2b + 2δ]

6. **Key Observations:**
   - If ε + δ < 1, then [x + y] = a + b, so L(x, y) = 2a + 2b.
   - If ε + δ ≥ 1, then [x + y] = a + b + 1, so L(x, y) = 2a + 2b + 1.
   - For R(x, y), if 2ε < 1, then [2x] = 2a, and if 2ε ≥ 1, then [2x] = 2a + 1. Similarly for [2y].

7. **Conclusion:**

Since the conditions are similar, these triangles are similar, and we can set up a proportion to find the height of the tree.

Step 1: Identify the known values for the electric pole and its shadow.
- Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
- Length of the shadow of the electric pole = 10 meters

Step 2: Identify the known value for the tree's shadow.
- Length of the shadow of the tree = 15 meters

Step 3: Set up the proportion using the concept of similar triangles.
The ratio of the height of the pole to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow.

\[

D)8%
E)4%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest given that the difference between the simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understand the formulas:**
   - Simple Interest (SI) for 2 years = \( \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \)
   - Compound Interest (CI) for 2 years = \( P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \)

   Where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 5000)
   - \( R \) is the rate of interest
   - \( T \) is the time period (2 years)

2. **Calculate Simple Interest (SI):**
   - For 2 years, SI = \( \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 100R \)

3. **Calculate Compound Interest (CI):**
   - For 2 years, CI = \( 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 \)
   - Expanding the expression: \( \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} \)
   - Therefore, CI = \( 5000 \left(1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000}\right) - 5000 \)
   - CI = \( 5000 + \frac{10000R}{100} + \frac{5000R^2}{10000} - 5000 \)
   - CI = \( 100R + \frac{R^2}{2} \)

4. **Set up the equation for the difference:**
   - The difference between CI and SI is given as Rs. 72.
   - So, \( CI - SI = 72 \)
   - \( 100R + \frac{R^2}{2} - 100R = 72 \)
   - Simplifying, \( \frac{R^2}{2} = 72 \)
   - Multiply both sides by 2: \( R^2 = 144 \)

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.

A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Sam's files were not infected by a worm. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( V \) be the number of files infected by a virus.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of files infected by a worm.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Total files = 250.
   - 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
   - The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be expressed as \( W - B = 2.5B \).

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the above, we have \( W - B = 2.5B \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( W = 3.5B \).

4. **Use Total Files Equation:**
   - The total number of files is the sum of files infected by only a virus, only a worm, and both:
     \[
     (V - B) + (W - B) + B = 250
     \]
   - Substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \):
     \[
     (125 - B) + (3.5B - B) + B = 250
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     125 - B + 2.5B + B = 250
     \]
     \[
     125 + 2.5B = 250
     \]
   - Solve for \( B \):
     \[
     2.5B = 250 - 125
     \]
     \[
     2.5B = 125
     \]
     \[
     B = \frac{125}{2.5} = 50
     \]

5. **Find \( W \):**
   - Since \( W = 3.5B \):
     \[
     W = 3.5 \times 50 = 175
     \]

6. **Determine Files Not Infected by a Worm:**
   - Total files not infected by a worm = Total files - Files infected by a worm:
     \[
     250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of years each son's investment will grow:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so his investment will grow for 3 years (26 - 23 = 3).
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so his investment will grow for 2 years (26 - 24 = 2).

2. **Set up the compound interest formula:**
   The compound interest formula is given by:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
   \]
   where \(A\) is the amount after \(n\) years, \(P\) is the principal amount (initial investment), \(r\) is the rate of interest, and \(n\) is the number of years.

3. **Express the final amounts for Mohan and Sohan:**
   - Let Mohan's share be \(x\). After 3 years, his amount will be:
     \[
     A_{\text{Mohan}} = x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = x \left(1.04\right)^3
     \]
   - Let Sohan's share be \(5100 - x\). After 2 years, his amount will be:
     \[
     A_{\text{Sohan}} = (5100 - x) \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2 = (5100 - x) \left(1.04\right)^2
     \]

4. **Set the final amounts equal to each other:**
   Since both amounts should be equal when they reach 26 years of age:
   \[
   x \left(1.04\right)^3 = (5100 - x) \left(1.04\right)^2
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \(x\):**
   - First, calculate \((1.04)^3\) and \((1.04)^2\):
     \[
     (1.04)^3 = 1.124864
     \]
     \[
     (1.04)^2 = 1.0816

   - Substitute these values into the equation:
     \[
     x \times 1.124864 = (5100 - x) \times 1.0816
     \]
   - Distribute the right side:
     \[
     x \times 1.124864 = 5100 \times 1.0816 - x \times 1.0816
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     x \times 1.124864 + x \times 1.0816 = 5100 \times 1.0816

     \[
     x (1.124864 + 1.0816) = 5512.16

     \[
     x = \frac{5512.16}{0.043264}

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Original Coin:**
   The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness (height) of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm. The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius is 7.5 mm.

   The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V = \pi (7.5)^2 (2) = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm}
   \]

2. **Determine the Volume of Aluminum and Silver:**
   The problem states that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Therefore, each metal occupies half of the total volume of the coin.

   Volume of aluminum = Volume of silver = \(\frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \text{ cubic mm}\)

3. **Determine the Weight of Aluminum and Silver:**
   The total weight of the coin is 30 grams. Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_A \) and the density of silver be \( \rho_S \).

   Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we have:
   \[
   \rho_S = 2\rho_A
   \]

   The weight of aluminum \( W_A \) and the weight of silver \( W_S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   W_A = \rho_A \times 56.25\pi
   \]
   \[
   W_S = \rho_S \times 56.25\pi = 2\rho_A \times 56.25\pi

   The total weight is:
   \[
   W_A + W_S = 30

   \[
   \rho_A \times 56.25\pi + 2\rho_A \times 56.25\pi = 30

   \[
   3\rho_A \times 56.25\pi = 30

   \[
   \rho_A = \frac{10}{56.25\pi}

4. **Calculate the Weight of the New Coin:**
   The new coin is made of pure aluminum and measures 1 mm in thickness and 30 mm in diameter. The radius is 15 mm.

   The volume \( V' \) of the new coin is:
   \[
   V' = \pi (15)^2 (1) = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm}

   The weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is:
   \[
   W' = \rho_A \times 225\pi

   \[
   W' = \left(\frac{10}{56.25\pi}\right) \times 225\pi

According to the problem, 2/3 of the number minus 10 is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. We can write this as an equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x

To eliminate the fractions, let's multiply every term in the equation by 3:

\[

E)12",C,"To determine the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\) will have two real and distinct roots, we need to use the discriminant condition for quadratic equations.

The general form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). The discriminant \(\Delta\) of this equation is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0
\]

In our equation, \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = k\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We need this discriminant to be greater than zero:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Solving this inequality for \(k\):

1. Subtract 25 from both sides:

   \[
   -4k > -25
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -4, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:

   \[
   k < \frac{25}{4}
   \]

3. Calculate \(\frac{25}{4}\):

   \[
   \frac{25}{4} = 6.25

Since \(k\) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6.

Therefore, the largest integral value of \(k\) for which the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots is:

\[

However, the options provided do not include 6. Let's verify the options:

- \(k = 9\): \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 9 = 25 - 36 = -11\) (not greater than 0)

- \(k = 8\): \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 8 = 25 - 32 = -7\) (not greater than 0)
- \(k = 12\): \(\Delta = 25 - 4 \times 12 = 25 - 48 = -23\) (not greater than 0)

1. **Calculate the riding time:**
   - Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour.
   - To cover 100 km, the riding time is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Riding time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}

2. **Calculate the number of rest stops:**
   - Shweta stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km.

   - Since she cannot stop a fraction of a time, we consider the whole number of segments she completes before reaching 100 km. She completes 6 full segments of 15 km each, and then she rides the remaining distance without needing another rest stop.

3. **Calculate the total rest time:**
   - Shweta takes a rest after each of the first 6 segments.
   - Each rest is 10 minutes long.
   - Total rest time is:

   - Let's assume the initial amount of food in the bowl is 1 unit (or 100%).

2. **First Feeding (8:00 am):**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the food remaining.
   - Remaining food = 1 - (1/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the original amount.

3. **Second Feeding (9:00 am):**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (2/3) - (1/3) * (2/3) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the original amount.

4. **Third Feeding (10:00 am):**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (4/9) - (1/3) * (4/9) = (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27 of the original amount.

5. **Fourth Feeding (11:00 am):**
   - The dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food.
   - Remaining food = (8/27) - (1/3) * (8/27) = (8/27) * (2/3) = 16/81 of the original amount.

6. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To find the percentage of the original food remaining, we convert 16/81 to a percentage.
   - (16/81) * 100% ≈ 19.75%

Since we are asked for an approximate percentage, we round 19.75% to the nearest whole number, which is 20%.

B)120
C)50
D)200
E)80",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who took the survey.

1. **Identify the percentage of men surveyed:**
   - Since 60% of the people surveyed were women, the remaining 40% were men.

2. **Determine the number of men who preferred red cars:**
   - We know that 75% of the men preferred red cars. Therefore, 25% of the men preferred green cars.

3. **Relate the percentage to the number of men who preferred green cars:**
   - We are given that 10 men preferred green cars. This 10 men represent 25% of the total number of men surveyed.

4. **Calculate the total number of men surveyed:**
   - If 25% of the men equals 10, then the total number of men surveyed is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total men} = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of people surveyed:**
   - Since men make up 40% of the total survey population, and we have found there are 40 men, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.40 \times \text{Total people} = 40
     \]

C)90
D)91
E)92",B,"To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to find the number of ways to reach each step, building up to the 10th step.

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If there are 0 steps, there is 1 way to be at the start (doing nothing).
   - If there is 1 step, there is 1 way to reach it (one single step).

2. **Recursive Relation:**
   - For any step `n`, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the ways to reach the previous step (`n-1`) and the ways to reach the step before that (`n-2`).
   - This is because from step `n-1`, you can take a single step to reach `n`, and from step `n-2`, you can take a double step to reach `n`.

3. **Calculate the Number of Ways for Each Step:**
   - Let `ways(n)` be the number of ways to reach step `n`.
   - `ways(0) = 1` (1 way to stay at the ground)
   - `ways(1) = 1` (1 way to reach the first step)
   - For `n >= 2`, `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`

4. **Compute for 10 Steps:**
   - `ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1) = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2) = 3 + 2 = 5`
   - `ways(5) = ways(4) + ways(3) = 5 + 3 = 8`
   - `ways(6) = ways(5) + ways(4) = 8 + 5 = 13`
   - `ways(7) = ways(6) + ways(5) = 13 + 8 = 21`
   - `ways(8) = ways(7) + ways(6) = 21 + 13 = 34`

B)1
C)1.25
D)1.5
E)2",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to the existing mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the total mixture.

1. **Initial Mixture Composition:**
   - The initial mixture is 1 gallon of soft drink.
   - It contains 40% orange juice and 60% water.
   - Therefore, the amount of orange juice in the initial mixture is 0.4 gallons (40% of 1 gallon).

2. **Desired Mixture Composition:**
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture.
   - Let \( x \) be the additional gallons of orange juice to be added.

3. **Equation Setup:**
   - After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes \( 0.4 + x \) gallons.
   - The total volume of the mixture becomes \( 1 + x \) gallons (since we are adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice to the original 1 gallon).
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
     \]
   - Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
     \[
     0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
     \]
     \[
     0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
     \]
   - Subtract 0.4 from both sides:
     \[
     0.4x = 0.2
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5

D)13
E)14",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when both 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they leave the same remainder.

1. **Set up the equations for the remainders:**

   When 2272 is divided by \( N \), the remainder is \( R \). So, we can write:
   \[
   2272 = q_1 \times N + R
   \]
   where \( q_1 \) is the quotient.

   Similarly, when 875 is divided by \( N \), the remainder is also \( R \). So, we can write:
   \[
   875 = q_2 \times N + R

   This implies that \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397.

3. **Find the divisors of 1397:**

   We need to factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Checking divisibility by small prime numbers:

   - 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
   - Sum of digits of 1397 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20, not divisible by 3.
   - 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \), not divisible.
   - Check divisibility by 11: Alternating sum of digits is \( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \), divisible by 11.

   Dividing 1397 by 11:
   \[
   1397 \div 11 = 127

   - Let the initial total weight of the 10 oarsmen be \( W \).
   - The average weight of the 10 oarsmen is \( \frac{W}{10} \).

2. **New Average Weight Calculation:**
   - When the 53 kg oarsman is replaced, the average weight increases by 1.8 kg.
   - Therefore, the new average weight is \( \frac{W}{10} + 1.8 \).

3. **New Total Weight Calculation:**
   - The new total weight of the 10 oarsmen is \( W - 53 + x \), where \( x \) is the weight of the new man.
   - The new average weight is also equal to \( \frac{W - 53 + x}{10} \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We equate the new average weight expressions:
     \[
     \frac{W}{10} + 1.8 = \frac{W - 53 + x}{10}
     \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     W + 18 = W - 53 + x
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     18 = -53 + x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 18 + 53 = 71
     \]

Thus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg.

227,,"A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
A)11
B)10
C)9
D)8
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We have a total of \( n \) balls, numbered from 1 to \( n \). We need to find \( n \) such that the number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining \( n-1 \) balls (excluding the ball numbered 3) is 45.

2. **Combinatorial setup**: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n-1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{n-1}{2} = 45
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**: The combination formula is:
   \[
   \binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   (n-1)(n-2) = 90
   \]

4. **Expanding and rearranging**:
   \[
   n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
   \]

   Subtract 90 from both sides:
   \[
   n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
   \]

   Simplify:
   \[
   n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
   \]

5. **Solving the quadratic equation**: We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \):
   \[
   n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

   Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-88) = 9 + 352 = 361
   \]

   Since 361 is a perfect square (\( 19^2 \)), we can find \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}
   \]

   This gives two potential solutions:
   \[
   n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = -8
   \]

   Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have:
   \[
   n = 11
   \]

6. **Verification**: If \( n = 11 \), then the number of balls excluding the ball numbered 3 is \( 10 \). The number of ways to choose 2 balls from these 10 is:
   \[
   \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = 45
   \]

   This matches the given condition.

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{11} \), which corresponds to option (A).",True,,,,,

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only
E)I and III only",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which a positive integer \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors.

1. **Understanding the number of factors:**
   - If a number \( Q \) has a prime factorization of \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), then the number of factors of \( Q \) is given by \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \).
   - We need this product to equal 5.

2. **Analyzing the possibilities:**
   - Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \).
   - This implies that one of the exponents \( a_i \) must be 4 (since \( a_i + 1 = 5 \)), and all other exponents must be 0 (since \( 1 = 1 \)).

3. **Conclusion from the factorization:**
   - Therefore, \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This means \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number.

4. **Evaluating the statements:**
   - **Statement I:** ""Q is the square of a prime number."" 
     - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors is \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which is not 5. So, this statement is false.
   - **Statement II:** ""Q is the fourth power of a prime number.""
     - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This statement is true.

1. **Determine Jack's work rate:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his work rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Calculate the work Jack has completed:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work he has completed is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the yacht.

3. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The total work is 1 yacht. Since Jack has completed \( \frac{2}{3} \), the remaining work is:

241,,"Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
A)45
B)48
C)50
D)55
E)58",C,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Joe's age as \( J \)
- Joe's sister's age as \( S \)
- Joe's father's age as \( F \)

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The sum of their ages is 100:
   \[
   J + S + F = 100
   \]

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This means the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age:
   \[
   F - J = 2S - S = S
   \]
   So, \( F - J = S \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means:
   - The difference in age between Joe and his father is \( F - J \).
   - The difference in age between Joe's sister and her father is \( F - S \).
   - When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be \( F + (F - J) \).
   - When Joe's sister was as old as her father, her father was \( F - (F - S) = S \).
   - Therefore, \( F + (F - J) = 2S \).

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 2, we have:
\[
F = J + S
\]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation 1:
\[
J + S + (J + S) = 100
\]
\[
2J + 2S = 100
\]
\[
J + S = 50
\]

Now, substitute \( J + S = 50 \) into equation 3:
\[
F + (F - J) = 2S
\]
Since \( F = J + S \), we have:
\[
(J + S) + ((J + S) - J) = 2S
\]
\[
J + S + S = 2S
\]
\[
J + 2S = 2S
\]
This equation is consistent, meaning it doesn't provide new information.

Now, we know:
- \( J + S = 50 \)
- \( F = J + S = 50 \)

Thus, Joe's father's age \( F \) is 50.
