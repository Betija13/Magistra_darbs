C)240
------
C)240
------
C)240
------
To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to calculate the yearly production cost and the required yearly revenue to achieve the desired profit.

1. Calculate the yearly production cost:
   - Monthly production cost per component = $110
   - Monthly production = 420 units
   - Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * 12 months * $110/unit = $554,400

2. Calculate the required yearly revenue to achieve a profit of at least $626,400:
   - Desired yearly profit = $626,400
   - Required yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Desired yearly profit
   - Required yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

3. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:
   - Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
   - Minimum selling price per component = Required yearly revenue / Yearly production
   - Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.13

Since the selling price must be a whole number and at least $234.13, we round up to the nearest option provided.

To solve this problem, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

1. Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. According to the problem, the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so we have:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. Therefore, the total sum of all scores is:
   \[
   zy
   \]

3. We want to find the average score excluding the highest and lowest scores. The sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest is:
   \[
   \text{Total sum of scores} - \text{Sum of highest and lowest scores} = zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x
   \]

4. The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:
   \[
   z - 2
   \]

5. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:
   \[
   \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}

Thus, the correct answer is:
```

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. Therefore, the total sum of all scores is:

3. To find the average score excluding the highest and lowest scores, we need the sum of the scores of the remaining \(z - 2\) students. This sum is:
   \[
   \text{Total sum of all scores} - \text{Sum of highest and lowest scores} = zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x
