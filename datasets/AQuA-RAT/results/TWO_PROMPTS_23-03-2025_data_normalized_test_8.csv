The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( x_1 \). When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the base is \( x_2 \).

From the trigonometric identity for tangent, we have:
1. \(\tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \Rightarrow h = x_1\)
2. \(\tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x_2\)

Since \( h = x_1 \) and \( h = \sqrt{3}x_2 \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
\[ x_1 = \sqrt{3}x_2 \]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

Let \( v \) be the speed of the car. Then:
\[ v \times 10 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]
\[ v = \frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \]

The time \( t \) it takes to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base (distance \( x_2 \)) is:
\[ t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{x_2}{\frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Thus, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90

5. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8

   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 9 can be factored into \( 3^2 \).
   - 12 can be factored into \( 2^2 \times 3 \).

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the scenario where both stocks do not increase. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase, which is 0.74.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither stock increases, we assume that the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{neither A nor B increases}) = (1 - P(A)) \times (1 - P(B)) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let's consider the possibility that the events are not independent and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the greatest possible probability that neither event occurs.

The probability that at least one of the stocks increases is given by:

\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B). \]

The probability that neither stock increases is:

\[ 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)). \]

To maximize \( 1 - P(A \cup B) \), we need to minimize \( P(A \cap B) \). The minimum value of \( P(A \cap B) \) is 0 (if the events are mutually exclusive), so:

\[ 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0) = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, this indicates that the events cannot be mutually exclusive. Therefore, we should consider the maximum possible overlap, which is when one event is a subset of the other. In this case, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs is when the events are independent, which we calculated as 0.1144.

Since this value is not among the answer choices, let's consider the answer choices again. The closest and greatest value that fits the context of the problem is:

\[ \boxed{0.26} \]

This suggests that the problem may have intended for a different interpretation or simplification, but based on the given probabilities and the answer choices, 0.26 is the most reasonable choice.

4,,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}
\]

Given that the profit is 20% of the cost price, we can express the selling price as:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}
\]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
\]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag. When another 20 marbles were pulled out, 1 of them was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is the same as the percentage of black marbles in the sample of 20 marbles pulled out.

The percentage of black marbles in the sample is:

\[
\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%
\]

This implies that 5% of the marbles in the bag are black. Since there are 20 black marbles in the bag, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.05 \times Q = 20

Solving for \( Q \), we divide both sides by 0.05:

\[

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining:**
   - At 100 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 250 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The remaining distance after it starts raining is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - At 75 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 750 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time after rain} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time before and after it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

8,,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"ANSWER_1: To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the set of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the set of students who took part in the debating session.

We know:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \(|P| \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90\).
- At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so \(|D| \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70\).

We want to find the maximum number of students who did neither, which is the complement of the union of \( P \) and \( D \).

The formula for the union of two sets is:
\[
|P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D|
\]

To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize \(|P \cup D|\). The minimum value of \(|P \cup D|\) occurs when \(|P \cap D|\) is maximized. The maximum possible value for \(|P \cap D|\) is when all students in the smaller group are also in the larger group, i.e., \(|P \cap D| = 70\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|P \cup D|\) is:
\[
|P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90
\]

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
\[
200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 90 = 110

1. 10% of the staplers produced were defective.
2. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
3. 72 non-defective staplers were rejected.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as \( x \).

First, calculate the number of defective staplers:

The number of non-defective staplers is:
\[ x - 0.10x = 0.90x \]

2% of these non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which equals 72:

E)72 minutes",C,"ANSWER_1: To determine how many minutes it will take for Machines A and B to produce a total of 10 yo-yos, we need to calculate the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos and then find the combined rate.

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate is:
\[ \text{Rate of Machine A} = \frac{1 \text{ yo-yo}}{6 \text{ minutes}} \]

Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate is:
\[ \text{Rate of Machine B} = \frac{1 \text{ yo-yo}}{9 \text{ minutes}} \]

The combined rate of both machines is the sum of their individual rates:
\[ \text{Combined Rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Converting each rate to have a denominator of 18 gives:
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18} \]
\[ \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18} \]

Adding these gives:
\[ \text{Combined Rate} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \]

This means together, the machines produce \(\frac{5}{18}\) yo-yos per minute.

To find out how many minutes it takes to produce 10 yo-yos, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5}{18} \times \text{minutes} = 10 \]

Solving for minutes:
\[ \text{minutes} = \frac{10 \times 18}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. You walk 20 steps and then stop. The elevator takes you to the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. You walk 10 steps and then stop. The elevator takes you to the bottom in 20 minutes.

For the first scenario:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator needs to cover \( S - 20 \) steps.
- It takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the speed of the elevator is \(\frac{S - 20}{10}\) steps per minute.

For the second scenario:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator needs to cover \( S - 10 \) steps.
- It takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the speed of the elevator is \(\frac{S - 10}{20}\) steps per minute.

Since the speed of the elevator is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for the speed equal to each other:

\[
\frac{S - 20}{10} = \frac{S - 10}{20}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
20(S - 20) = 10(S - 10)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
20S - 400 = 10S - 100
\]

Subtract \(10S\) from both sides:

\[
10S - 400 = -100
\]

Add 400 to both sides:

\[
10S = 300
\]

Divide by 10:

\[
S = 30
\]

Now that we know the total number of steps \( S = 30 \), we can find the speed of the elevator using either scenario. Let's use the first scenario:

\[
\text{Speed of the elevator} = \frac{S - 20}{10} = \frac{30 - 20}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \text{ step per minute}
\]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute. The correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute.

E)None of the above",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold in the first 10 months of this year = 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

3. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22-month period:**
   - Total sold over 22 months = Total sold last year + Total sold in the first 10 months of this year
   - Total sold over 22 months = 504 ovens + 200 ovens = 704 ovens.

4. **Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:**
   - Average = Total sold over 22 months / 22 months
   - Average = 704 ovens / 22 months ≈ 32 ovens/month.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The total hours worked by Alex is \( 7A \) (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The total hours worked by Jacob is \( 9J \) (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that they worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, express \( A \) from the first equation:
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the approximate hours equation:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be an integer, we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

E)6780",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students, \( N \), which is a 4-digit number and is divisible by 16, 10, and 8. Then, we will find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of \( N \).

First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime number appearing in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Now, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80 and a 4-digit number. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

1. **Minimum \( N \):**
   - Divide 1000 by 80: \( 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \).
   - The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13.
   - So, the smallest \( N \) is \( 80 \times 13 = 1040 \).

2. **Maximum \( N \):**
   - Divide 9999 by 80: \( 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \).
   - The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124.
   - So, the largest \( N \) is \( 80 \times 124 = 9920 \).

Finally, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

\[ 9920 - 1040 = 8880 \]

A)2 miles
B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"ANSWER_1: To determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we first need to calculate his speed on a windy day. 

Bill's normal speed is 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed becomes:

\[ 15 \text{ mph} - 4 \text{ mph} = 11 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is:

\[ \frac{21}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.35 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Bill can travel in 0.35 hours at a speed of 11 mph using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 11 \text{ mph} \times 0.35 \text{ hours} = 3.85 \text{ miles} \]

B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the selling price of the appliance, we need to determine the cost price first. We know that the gross profit is $20.00 and this represents 40% above the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price is 40% above the cost price, so it can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is given as $20.00:
\[ 1.4C - C = 0.4C = 20 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 0.4C = 20 \]
\[ C = \frac{20}{0.4} \]
\[ C = 50 \]

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. According to the problem, the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey, so the distance \( d \) can be expressed as:

\[ d = v \times 6 \]

During the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The return journey takes 4 hours, so the distance can also be expressed as:

\[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

Expanding the right side:

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[ 2v = 48 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ v = 24 \]

\]

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) is:
\[
S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet before it was folded.

Let's denote the length of the original rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \).

1. **Folding along the length:**

   When the sheet is folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. Since the length is halved, the dimensions of each part are \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).

   The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
   \[
   2 \left( \frac{l}{2} + w \right) = 48
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Folding along the width:**

   When the sheet is folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. Since the width is halved, the dimensions of each part are \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).

   The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
   \[
   2 \left( l + \frac{w}{2} \right) = 66
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
l + 2w &= 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
2l + w &= 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this system, we can multiply Equation 1 by 2:
\[
2l + 4w = 96
\]

Now, subtract Equation 2 from this result:
\[
(2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66
\]
\[
3w = 30
\]
\[
w = 10
\]

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 2:
\[
2l + 10 = 66
\]
\[
2l = 56
\]
\[
l = 28
\]

Now that we have the dimensions of the original rectangle, \( l = 28 \) and \( w = 10 \), we can find the area:
\[
\text{Area} = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280
\]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the area calculation:

B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the diameter of the sphere in which the rectangular solid is inscribed, we need to determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. The diagonal of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\), the diagonal \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
\]

Adding these values:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = 5\sqrt{10}
\]

The diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid, which is \(5\sqrt{10}\).

To approximate \(5\sqrt{10}\):

\[
\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623

A)3km
B)2km
C)4km
D)5km
E)6km",A,"ANSWER_1: To determine how far A is from the starting point, we can break down the movements into north-south and east-west components.

1. A starts by traveling 3 km south.
2. Then, A travels 5 km east.
3. Next, A travels 3 km north.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km west.

Let's calculate the net displacement in each direction:

- **North-South direction:**
  - A travels 3 km south and then 3 km north. 
  - Net displacement in the north-south direction = 3 km south - 3 km north = 0 km.

- **East-West direction:**
  - A travels 5 km east and then 2 km west.
  - Net displacement in the east-west direction = 5 km east - 2 km west = 3 km east.

Since there is no net displacement in the north-south direction, A's total displacement is only in the east-west direction, which is 3 km east.

37,,"A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
A)1584
B)2520
C)1728
D)1656
E)None",A,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote the number as \( x \).

The student was supposed to find \( \frac{7}{8} \) of the number, which is \( \frac{7}{8}x \).

Instead, the student found \( \frac{7}{18} \) of the number, which is \( \frac{7}{18}x \).

According to the problem, the difference between these two results is 770:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
\]

To solve for \( x \), first factor out \( \frac{7}{x} \):

\[
\frac{7}{x} \left( \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{18} \right) = 770
\]

Calculate the difference inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{18} = \frac{18 - 8}{144} = \frac{10}{144} = \frac{5}{72}
\]

Substitute back into the equation:

\[
\frac{7}{x} \cdot \frac{5}{72} = 770
\]

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{72}{5} \) to isolate \( x \):

\[
\frac{7}{x} = 770 \cdot \frac{72}{5}
\]

Calculate the right side:

\[
770 \cdot \frac{72}{5} = 770 \cdot 14.4 = 11088

Now solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{7}{x} = 11088 \implies x = \frac{7}{11088}

This step seems incorrect. Let's correct it:

\[
7x = 11088 \implies x = \frac{11088}{7} = 1584

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we can set up the equation based on the given salary structure:

\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want the salary \( S \) to be $1500:

\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Subtract $500 from both sides to isolate the term with sales:

\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for sales:

\[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

\[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

D)156
E)452",A,"ANSWER_1: To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Let's assume each side of the square is of length \(d\).

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies along the four sides of the square, the total distance traveled is \(4d\).

2. **Time Taken for Each Side**:
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours

3. **Total Time**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}

   To simplify, find a common denominator, which is 2400:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{12d}{2400} + \frac{6d}{2400} + \frac{4d}{2400} + \frac{3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400}

4. **Average Speed**: 
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}} = \frac{4d \times 2400}{25d} = \frac{9600}{25} = 384 \text{ km/hr}

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"ANSWER_1: Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Substituting \( y = 18 - x \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ x(b + 1) + (18 - x)b = 100 \]

Simplifying:

\[ xb + x + 18b - xb = 100 \]

\[ x + 18b = 100 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( b \) that satisfy both equations. Let's solve for \( b \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into the first equation:

\[ (100 - 18b) + y = 18 \]

\[ y = 18 - (100 - 18b) \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( b \) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers:

1. \( x = 100 - 18b \geq 0 \)
2. \( y = 18b - 82 \geq 0 \)

Solving these inequalities:

1. \( 100 - 18b \geq 0 \) gives \( b \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56 \)
2. \( 18b - 82 \geq 0 \) gives \( b \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56 \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the only possible value for \( b \) is 5.

Substitute \( b = 5 \) back into the equations:

\[ x = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 10 \]
\[ y = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 8 \]

Thus, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Therefore, the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since hose B's rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the pool alone.

E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To find out how much sale the servant needs to make to achieve a monthly income of 6000, we can set up the following equation:

1. The servant's monthly salary is 1500.
2. The servant also earns a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.

Let \( x \) be the amount of sales the servant needs to make.

The total income the servant wants is 6000, which includes both the salary and the commission. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1500 + 0.15x = 6000 \]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

A)1.5%
B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the interest rate, we first need to determine the total amount paid back and the total interest paid.

1. **Total Amount Paid Back:**
   The man pays Rs.31.50 per month for 12 months.
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid back} = 31.50 \times 12 = 378 \text{ Rs}
   \]

2. **Total Interest Paid:**
   The original amount borrowed was Rs.360. The total amount paid back is Rs.378.
   \[
   \text{Total interest paid} = 378 - 360 = 18 \text{ Rs}
   \]

3. **Interest Rate Calculation:**
   The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis. Here, the interest of Rs.18 is paid over one year (12 months).

   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Where:
   - Interest = Rs.18
   - Principal = Rs.360
   - Time = 1 year

   Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}} = \frac{18}{360 \times 1} = \frac{18}{360} = 0.05

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7}

How many of each are there?
A)453
B)651
C)400
D)487
E)286",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's define the number of each type of coin as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

- \( x \) coins of 25 paise
- \( x \) coins of 50 paise
- \( x \) coins of 1 rupee

The total value of the coins can be calculated as follows:

- The value of \( x \) coins of 25 paise is \( 0.25x \) rupees.
- The value of \( x \) coins of 50 paise is \( 0.50x \) rupees.
- The value of \( x \) coins of 1 rupee is \( 1.00x \) rupees.

The total value of all the coins is:

\[
0.25x + 0.50x + 1.00x = 1.75x
\]

We know the total value of the coins is Rs. 700, so we set up the equation:

\[
1.75x = 700

A)4
B)5
C)7
D)6
E)8",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

First, let's calculate how many toys are in one box. Since one dozen equals 12, five dozen toys would be:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ toys per box} \]

Next, we calculate how many toys are in one tempo. Since there are 98 boxes in one tempo, the total number of toys in one tempo is:

\[ 98 \times 60 = 5880 \text{ toys per tempo} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys. We do this by dividing the total number of toys by the number of toys per tempo:

\[ \frac{29400}{5880} = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. The correct answer is:

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked.

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The total work required is 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate the time for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time required = \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract. The correct answer is (D) 11.

56,,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Determine the structure of the hollow cube:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is on both sides.

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube (5 cm) consists of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) consists of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes that form the hollow structure:**
   - The hollow structure is formed by the outer cube minus the inner cube.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the hollow structure is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Determine the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The inner cubes (27 cubes) are completely unpainted, contributing \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces.
   - The cubes forming the hollow structure (98 cubes) have some faces painted. Each of these cubes has 1 face exposed to the outside, so 5 faces remain unpainted.
   - Therefore, the unpainted faces from the hollow structure are \(98 \times 5 = 490\).

5. **Total unpainted faces:**
   - The total number of unpainted faces is \(162 + 490 = 652\).

However, it seems there was a miscalculation in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the unpainted faces:

- The inner 3x3x3 cube contributes 162 unpainted faces.
- The outer layer (hollow structure) contributes 98 cubes, each with 5 unpainted faces, totaling 490 unpainted faces.

The correct calculation should be:

C)5%
D)9%
E)10%",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

1. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.

3. **Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - If 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.

4. **Calculate the percentage of the total chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:**
   - 10% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.

A)25 days
B)26 days
C)27 days
D)28 days
E)29 days",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net distance the frog covers each day and determine how many days it will take for the frog to climb out of the well.

Each day, the frog jumps up 3 meters and then falls back 2 meters. Therefore, the net distance the frog covers in one day is:

\[ 3 \, \text{meters} - 2 \, \text{meters} = 1 \, \text{meter} \]

However, on the last day, the frog will not fall back after reaching the top of the well. So, we need to consider the day when the frog reaches or exceeds the 30-meter mark.

Let's calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to reach 27 meters, because on the next day, the frog will jump 3 meters and reach the top without falling back:

- In 27 days, the frog will have climbed 27 meters (since it climbs 1 meter per day).

On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters from 27 meters, reaching 30 meters, and will exit the well.

Therefore, it will take the frog 28 days to come out of the well.

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's denote the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \). The sum of these numbers is:

\[
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20
\]

We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}
\]

This expression, \(\frac{n + 4}{2}\), must be a perfect square. Let \( k^2 \) be this perfect square, so:

\[
\frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \implies n + 4 = 2k^2 \implies n = 2k^2 - 4
\]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( k \) such that \( n \) is a two-digit odd number. Let's test some values of \( k \):

1. \( k = 3 \):
   \[
   n = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad (\text{not odd})

4. \( k = 6 \):
   \[
   n = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad (\text{not odd})
   \]

5. \( k = 7 \):
   \[
   n = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \quad (\text{odd})

The number 94 is a two-digit odd number. Let's check if 94 is one of the answer choices. The answer choices are 47, 91, 41, 67, and 44. Since 94 is not listed, let's check the sequence of numbers starting from 91:

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 91 are 91, 93, 95, 97, and 99. Their sum is:

\[
91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 = 475
\]

When divided by 10, this sum becomes:

\[
\frac{475}{10} = 47.5

This is not a perfect square. Let's try another sequence starting from 41:

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 41 are 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49. Their sum is:

\[
41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225

This is not a perfect square either. Let's try the sequence starting from 67:

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 67 are 67, 69, 71, 73, and 75. Their sum is:

\[
67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355

When divided by 10, this sum becomes:

\[
\frac{355}{10} = 35.5
\]

This is not a perfect square. Let's try the sequence starting from 91:

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 91 are 91, 93, 95, 97, and 99. Their sum is:

\[
91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 = 475
\]

When divided by 10, this sum becomes:

\[
\frac{475}{10} = 47.5
\]

This is not a perfect square. Let's try the sequence starting from 47:

The five consecutive odd numbers starting from 47 are 47, 49, 51, 53, and 55. Their sum is:

\[
47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255

According to the problem:
- 8% of the students are interested in Football, which is \( 0.08x \).
- \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( 0.8x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.1x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as \( q \), \( r \), and \( t \) respectively.

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:
\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we don't need to substitute back. We need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) as:
\[ t = 50 - r \]

Substituting \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation \( r - 25 = 25 - t \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means the specific values of \( r \) and \( t \) cannot be determined individually, but the relationship holds.

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age, \( r - q \), cannot be determined with the given information. The correct answer is:

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"ANSWER_1: To find the total number of matches played by Sachin, we can use the formula for batting average:

\[
\text{Batting Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{\text{Total Matches Played}}
\]

Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals as \( n \).

Given:
- Current batting average before the finals = 51
- Runs scored in the finals = 78
- New batting average after the finals = 54

Before the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{\text{Total Runs}}{n} = 51 \implies \text{Total Runs} = 51n
\]

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, the total runs become:

\[
51n + 78
\]

The new batting average after the finals is given by:

\[
\frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54
\]

Now, solve for \( n \):

\[
51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
51n + 78 = 54n + 54
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
78 - 54 = 54n - 51n
\]

\[
24 = 3n
\]

\[
n = 8
\]

Thus, the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals is 8. Including the finals, the total number of matches played is \( n + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 9.

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
A)3
B)4
C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

Let's denote the number of letters as \( n \).

1. **Single Letter Codes**: With \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) unique single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of unique pairs of two different letters is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The total number of unique codes (single letters and pairs) is:
\[
n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

We need this total to be at least 10:
\[
n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \geq 10
\]

Let's test the answer choices:

- **(A) \( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  3 + \frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 + \frac{6}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
  This is not enough.

- **(B) \( n = 4 \):**
  \[
  4 + \frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 4 + \frac{12}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10
  \]
  This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **(C) \( n = 5 \):**
  \[
  5 + \frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 5 + \frac{20}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15
  \]
  This is more than enough, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) is the smallest number that satisfies the condition, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\).

65,,"A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then calculate its perimeter.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:

\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]

Substituting the given values, we have:

\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding this equation, we get:

\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation gives us a quadratic equation:

\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

Now, calculate \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2401} = 49 \), we have:

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):

1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative)

Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters.

Now, calculate the length \( l \):

\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \text{ meters} \]

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters. The correct answer is (C) 62 m.

66,,"One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
A)8.5
B)10.5
C)12.5
D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: \(9\% \times x = 100\%\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get: \(x = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11\).

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: \(8\% \times x = 100\%\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get: \(x = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\).

To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated above, because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.

- The maximum of 11.11 and 12.5 is 12.5.

Therefore, at least 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

The correct answer is (C) 12.5.

67,,"Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"ANSWER_1: To determine how many helpers are required, we need to calculate the total number of hours needed to make the required cakes and then divide by the number of hours each helper works.

First, calculate the total hours needed for large cakes:
- Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour.
- 20 large cakes are needed.
- Therefore, the total hours needed for large cakes = 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes per hour = 10 hours.

Next, calculate the total hours needed for small cakes:
- Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour.
- 700 small cakes are needed.
- Therefore, the total hours needed for small cakes = 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per hour = 20 hours.

Now, add the total hours needed for both large and small cakes:
- Total hours needed = 10 hours (large cakes) + 20 hours (small cakes) = 30 hours.

The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so we need to determine how many helpers are required to complete 30 hours of work in 3 hours:
- Total helpers needed = Total hours needed / Hours available per helper = 30 hours / 3 hours per helper = 10 helpers.

E)10",A,"ANSWER_1: To find the length of line segment RU, we need to determine the positions of the points on the line based on the given information.

1. We know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, which means SU = UT. Since ST = 22, we have SU = UT = 22/2 = 11.

2. We are given that RS = 5 and RT = 17.

3. Since U is the midpoint of ST, we can express the positions of the points as follows:
   - Let R be at position 0 on the line.
   - Then S is at position 5 (since RS = 5).
   - T is at position 5 + 22 = 27 (since ST = 22).
   - U, being the midpoint of ST, is at position (5 + 27)/2 = 16.

4. Now, we need to find RU, which is the distance from R (position 0) to U (position 16).

Therefore, RU = 16.

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

1. **Establish the relationships:**

   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

2. **Express these relationships in terms of a common unit:**

   Let's denote the amount of falafel in one pita bread as \( P \), in one roll as \( R \), and in one baguette as \( B \).

   From the first relationship:
   \[
   6P = 2R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3P
   \]

   From the second relationship:
   \[
   3R = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \frac{5}{3}B
   \]

3. **Substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first relationship into the second:**

   \[
   3P = \frac{5}{3}B
   \]

   Solving for \( B \) in terms of \( P \):
   \[
   B = \frac{3}{5} \times 3P = \frac{9}{5}P
   \]

4. **Determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes:**

   We need to find the number of pita breads equivalent to two baguettes, i.e., \( 2B \).

   Substitute the expression for \( B \):
   \[
   2B = 2 \times \frac{9}{5}P = \frac{18}{5}P
   \]

   Since one pita bread contains \( P \) amount of falafel, the number of pita breads equivalent to \( \frac{18}{5}P \) is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{5}P \div P = \frac{18}{5}

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount. Therefore, the selling price on the discount day is:

\[ P_{\text{discount}} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price \( P \). To find the percentage increase needed from the discounted price back to the original price, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Here, the ""New Price"" is the original price \( P \), and the ""Old Price"" is the discounted price \( 0.80P \).

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - 0.80P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left( \frac{0.20}{0.80} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = 0.25 \times 100\% \]

\[ = 25\% \]

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price. The correct answer is (C) 25%.

C)13x/24
D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"ANSWER_1: To determine the total length of the fence in feet, we need to consider both the width of the pickets and the spaces between them.

1. **Width of the Pickets:**
   Each picket is \( \frac{1}{2} \) inch wide. For \( x \) pickets, the total width of the pickets is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}x \text{ inches}

2. **Spaces Between Pickets:**
   There are \( x - 1 \) spaces between \( x \) pickets, and each space is 6 inches wide. Therefore, the total width of the spaces is:
   \[
   6(x - 1) \text{ inches}

3. **Total Length in Inches:**
   The total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces:

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's denote:
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_p = 10v_s \) as the speed of the plane, since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship.
- \( t \) as the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.

The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts. In time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( v_s \times t \).

The plane, starting from the same point as the ship, travels a distance of \( v_p \times t = 10v_s \times t \).

They meet when the total distance traveled by the ship equals the distance traveled by the plane. Therefore, we have:

\[
180 + v_s \times t = 10v_s \times t
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
180 = 10v_s \times t - v_s \times t
\]
\[
180 = 9v_s \times t
\]
\[
t = \frac{180}{9v_s} = \frac{20}{v_s}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance from the starting point when they meet. The ship travels for a total time of \( t + \frac{180}{v_s} \) hours, which is:

\[
t + \frac{180}{v_s} = \frac{20}{v_s} + \frac{180}{v_s} = \frac{200}{v_s}

The total distance traveled by the ship from the starting point is:

\[
v_s \times \frac{200}{v_s} = 200

The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is:

\[
\frac{20}{500} = \frac{\text{Number of tagged deer in the population}}{\text{Total deer population}}

Let's break down the train schedules:

- The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM. So, the trains arrive at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on.
- The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the trains arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.

Now, let's consider the time intervals between the arrivals of the two trains:

- From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:12 to 5:20, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:20 to 5:22, the main line train is the first to arrive.
- From 5:22 to 5:30, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.

This pattern repeats every 10 minutes. Within each 10-minute cycle, the main line train is the first to arrive for 4 minutes (5:00-5:02, 5:10-5:12, 5:20-5:22, etc.), and the harbor line train is the first to arrive for 6 minutes (5:02-5:10, 5:12-5:20, 5:22-5:30, etc.).

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (the harbor line train) is the time the harbor line train is first divided by the total cycle time:

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population one year from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \]

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

We are told that the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

\[ 1.21 = 2 \]

This equation is not correct, which means we need to adjust our understanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The population two years from now is double the population one year ago, so:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Let \( P_{\text{last year}} \) be the population last year. Then:

\[ P = P_{\text{last year}} \times (1 + x) \]

where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year.

Substituting back, we have:

\[ P_{\text{last year}} \times (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Cancel \( P_{\text{last year}} \) from both sides:

\[ (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 1 + x = \frac{2}{1.21} \]

\[ 1 + x \approx 1.6529 \]

\[ x \approx 0.6529 \]

Converting to a percentage, \( x \approx 65.29\% \).

A)62, 35
B)62, 34
C)34, 62
D)42, 62
E)62, 42",B,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as \( A \) and the amount Sajal has as \( S \).

According to the first condition:  
If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.  
This can be expressed as:  
\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \]  
\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \]  
\[ S = 2A - 90 \] \[ \text{(Equation 1)} \]

According to the second condition:  
If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.  
This can be expressed as:  
\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]  
\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]  
\[ A = 3S - 40 \] \[ \text{(Equation 2)} \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]  
\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]  
\[ A = 6A - 310 \]  
\[ 310 = 6A - A \]  
\[ 310 = 5A \]  
\[ A = 62 \]

Now substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]  
\[ S = 124 - 90 \]  
\[ S = 34 \]

Thus, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The correct answer is (B) 62, 34.

We know the area is 3,000 square feet and one side (the width) is 100 feet. Let's denote the length of the other side as \( L \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

To solve for \( L \), divide both sides of the equation by 100:

We are given:
- GCF = 11
- LCM = 7700
- Integer 1 = 350

Let's denote the other integer as \( x \). Plugging the known values into the equation, we have:

\[

83,,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( s \) be the side length of the original square.
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculate the area of the triangles:**
   - The area of the rectangle is \( s \times (s - 4) \).
   - Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.
   - Therefore, the area of each triangle is \(\frac{s \times (s - 4)}{2} = 70\).

4. **Solve for \( s \):**
   \[
   \frac{s \times (s - 4)}{2} = 70
   \]
   \[
   s \times (s - 4) = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
   \]

5. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for \( s \):**
   The quadratic formula is \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

   \[
   s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
   \]

   The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
   \[
   s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10
   \]

   Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

6. **Calculate the perimeter of the original square:**
   - The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet. The correct answer is (A) 56.

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

First, we calculate the length of one part by dividing the original length by the original ratio part:

\[ \text{Length of one part} = \frac{30 \, \text{cm}}{5} = 6 \, \text{cm} \]

Now, we calculate the new length of the ribbon by multiplying the length of one part by the new ratio part:

\[ \text{New length} = 3 \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 18 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is 18 cm. The correct answer is (A) 18.

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations.

1. \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
2. \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).
3. We are given that \( M > N \).
4. The equation given is \( M - N + 396c = 990 \).

First, let's express \( M - N \):

\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990 \implies 99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:

\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we need to find integer solutions for \( a + 3c = 10 \).

Let's find the possible values for \( c \) and corresponding \( a \):

- If \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit).
- If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \).
- If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \).
- If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \).
- If \( c = 4 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 4 = -2 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a digit).

Thus, the possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

Now, let's find the values of \( M \) for each pair:

1. For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \).
2. For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \).
3. For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\), \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \).

We need to find how many values of \( M \) are more than 300.

- For \( M = 701 + 10b \), all values are more than 300 (since 701 is already greater than 300). There are 10 possible values (one for each \( b \) from 0 to 9).
- For \( M = 402 + 10b \), all values are more than 300. There are 10 possible values (one for each \( b \) from 0 to 9).
- For \( M = 103 + 10b \), only values where \( 103 + 10b > 300 \) are valid. Solving \( 103 + 10b > 300 \) gives \( 10b > 197 \), so \( b \geq 20 \) (not possible since \( b \) is a digit).

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{20}\).

86,,"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
A)550
B)570
C)600
D)700
E)none of these",E,"ANSWER_1: To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the percentages of students taking exactly physics and exactly math. 

Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school. According to the problem:

- 20% of the students took exactly physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took exactly math: \( 0.28N \)

Since these are exact numbers, the sum of students taking exactly physics and exactly math should be less than or equal to the total number of students:

\[ 0.2N + 0.28N \leq N \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 0.48N \leq N \]

This inequality is always true, so it doesn't help us directly find the minimum number of students. However, we know that the total number of students must be more than 501, and it must be a number that allows both 20% and 28% to be whole numbers.

To find the least possible number of students, we need to find the smallest \( N > 501 \) such that both \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) are integers. This means \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of 0.2 and 0.28, which are 5 and 25, respectively.

The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

The smallest multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525. However, 525 is not an option in the answer choices. The next multiple of 25 is 550, which is an option.

Let's verify:

- For \( N = 550 \):
  - \( 0.2 \times 550 = 110 \) (an integer)
  - \( 0.28 \times 550 = 154 \) (an integer)

Both calculations result in integers, so 550 is a valid number of students.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

The correct answer is (A) 550.

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

1. Let's denote Raj's age 5 years ago as \( R_{Raj} \) and Rahim's age 5 years ago as \( R_{Rahim} \).

2. We know that Raj is currently 17 years old. Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was:
   \[
   R_{Raj} = 17 - 5 = 12
   \]

3. According to the problem, 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   R_{Raj} = \frac{1}{3} R_{Rahim}
   \]

4. Substituting the value of \( R_{Raj} \) from step 2 into the equation:
   \[
   12 = \frac{1}{3} R_{Rahim}
   \]

5. Solving for \( R_{Rahim} \), we multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   R_{Rahim} = 12 \times 3 = 36
   \]

6. Therefore, Rahim's age 5 years ago was 36. To find Rahim's current age, we add 5 years:
   \[
   \text{Current age of Rahim} = 36 + 5 = 41

Thus, Rahim is currently 41 years old. The correct answer is (B) 41.

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"ANSWER_1: To determine how long it will take for the cow to graze the entire area it can reach, we first need to calculate the area of the circle that the cow can graze. The cow is tethered with a 14-foot rope, which means it can graze in a circle with a radius of 14 feet.

The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[ A = \pi \times 14^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 3.1416 \times 196 \]
\[ A \approx 615.75 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.75}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.575 \]

Since the cow cannot graze a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take approximately 62 days for the cow to graze the entire area.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price.

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP
   \]

   Given that SP = Rs. 27.50, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50
   \]

   Solving for CP:

   \[
   CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this with the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
   \]

   Since the result is positive, it is a profit of Rs. 0.75.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{CP} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100 = 3\%

First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any restrictions. This is simply the number of permutations of 3 distinct items, which is given by:

\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. For any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there is a corresponding arrangement where Susan and Tim switch places. Therefore, exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim.

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the total bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the total bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have both the fixed and variable components:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500

\[
= 1680

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again simultaneously. This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Next, find the LCM of 13 and 7. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:

\[ \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:

The total cost for the week is given as $210, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 6x + 8x = 210 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 14x = 210 \]

Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 14:
\[ x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \]

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. The correct answer is (A) 15.

95,,"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"ANSWER_1: Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the original number of friends be \( x \).
2. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96.
3. If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.
4. Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).
5. The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them paid \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \) rupees.
6. According to the problem, the new contribution per person is 4 rupees more than the original contribution, so:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

7. To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

8. Simplify and expand the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

9. Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

10. Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

11. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
\]

12. Set each factor to zero and solve for \( x \):

\[
x - 12 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 12
\]
\[
x + 8 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

The correct answer is (A) 8.

96,,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we first need to determine the perimeter of the original rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ P = 88 \, \text{cm} \]

The wire is then rebent to form a square, which means the perimeter of the square is also 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is:

\[ P = 4 \times \text{side} \]

Let the side of the square be \( s \). Then:

\[ 4s = 88 \]

Solving for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{88}{4} \]
\[ s = 22 \]

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. The correct answer is (C) 22.

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:
\[ 2x + 16x + 25x = 43x \]

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so:
\[ 43x = 8600 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 43:
\[ x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200 \]

Now, we can find how much each daughter receives:
Each daughter receives \( 4x = 4 \times 200 = 800 \).

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

The correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

98,,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( x \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:

\[ 2x = 58 + x \]

Next, subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ 2x - x = 58 \]

\[ x = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The correct answer is (D) 58.

C)90 Min
D)120 Min
E)60 Min",E,"ANSWER_1: To determine how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets, we need to consider the timing of taking each tablet.

1. Roy takes the first tablet at the start, which is at 0 minutes.
2. He takes the second tablet 15 minutes after the first one.
3. He takes the third tablet 15 minutes after the second one.
4. He takes the fourth tablet 15 minutes after the third one.
5. He takes the fifth tablet 15 minutes after the fourth one.

The time intervals between taking each tablet are 15 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to consume all 5 tablets is:

- 0 minutes for the first tablet
- 15 minutes for the second tablet
- 15 minutes for the third tablet
- 15 minutes for the fourth tablet
- 15 minutes for the fifth tablet
