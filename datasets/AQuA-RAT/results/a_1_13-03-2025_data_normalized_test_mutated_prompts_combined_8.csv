0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of uniform speed.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the tower.
   - Initially, the angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower is 45°.
   - After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation changes to 60°.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower be \( d_1 \) when the angle is 45°.
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower be \( d_2 \) when the angle is 60°.

3. **Setting up the Equations:**
   - At 45°, \( \tan(45°) = 1 \), so \( \frac{h}{d_1} = 1 \) which implies \( d_1 = h \).
   - At 60°, \( \tan(60°) = \sqrt{3} \), so \( \frac{h}{d_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

4. **Distance Travelled in 10 Minutes:**
   - The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - Distance travelled in 10 minutes = \( d_1 - d_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}) \).

5. **Speed of the Car:**
   - Speed = Distance/Time = \( \frac{h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10} \).

6. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - Remaining distance to the base = \( d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).
   - Time to reach the base = Remaining distance / Speed.
   - Time = \( \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}})}{10}} \).
   - Simplifying, Time = \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \).

7. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{3} + 1 \).
   - Time = \( \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} \).
   - Time = \( \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} \).
   - Time = \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

The correct answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).",True,,,
1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve the problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price after the coupon is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.80
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.80
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.80
   \]
   Divide by 0.56:
   \[
   x = \frac{43.80}{0.56} = 78.2142857

C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price is 120% of the cost price because the trader sold it at a profit of 20%.

Let the cost price be \( x \).

The selling price is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = x + 0.2x = 1.2x \]

We know the selling price is Rs.360, so:
\[ 1.2x = 360 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{360}{1.2} \]

Calculate \( x \):
\[ x = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag.
   - When 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, 1 was black.

2. **Percentage Calculation:**
   - The percentage of black marbles in the second draw is \(\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

3. **Determine Total Marbles:**
   - If 5% of the marbles are black, and there are 20 black marbles in total (since all painted marbles are black), then:

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.

1. Calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom night:
   - 45% of 200 students = 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.

2. Calculate the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session:
   - 35% of 200 students = 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

3. To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to minimize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap occurs when the total number of students who attended either event is minimized.

4. The minimum number of students who attended at least one event is the sum of the minimum attendees of each event minus the maximum possible overlap. The maximum overlap is when all students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night, or vice versa.

5. Calculate the minimum number of students who attended at least one event:
   - Minimum attendees = 90 (prom) + 70 (debating) - 70 (maximum overlap) = 90 students.

6. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
   - Total students - Minimum attendees = 200 - 90 = 110 students.

Thus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 110.

B)24
C)25
D)40
E)52",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sales of $250 each are required for the salesperson to earn at least $1000 in commission.

1. Calculate the commission for one sale:
   - The commission rate is 10%.
   - For a $250 sale, the commission is 10% of $250.
   - Commission per sale = 0.10 * $250 = $25.

2. Determine the number of sales needed to earn at least $1000:
   - We need the total commission to be at least $1000.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of sales needed.
   - Total commission = $25 * \( n \).
   - We set up the inequality: $25 * \( n \) ≥ $1000.

3. Solve the inequality:
   - Divide both sides by $25 to solve for \( n \):
   - \( n \) ≥ $1000 / $25

E)280",B,"To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total production cost for the year and then determine the required revenue to achieve the desired profit.

1. **Calculate the total production cost for the year:**
   - Monthly production cost per component = $110
   - Number of components produced per month = 420
   - Total production cost per month = 420 components * $110/component = $46,200
   - Total production cost for the year = $46,200/month * 12 months = $554,400

2. **Determine the required revenue for the desired profit:**
   - Desired yearly profit = $626,400
   - Required revenue = Total production cost + Desired profit
   - Required revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800

3. **Calculate the minimum selling price per component:**
   - Total number of components produced and sold in a year = 420 components/month * 12 months = 5,040 components
   - Minimum selling price per component = Required revenue / Total number of components
   - Minimum selling price per component = $1,080,800 / 5,040 components ≈ $214.29

A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

Let's denote:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( n \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. Walking 20 steps and stopping, reaching the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. Walking 10 steps and stopping, reaching the bottom in 20 minutes.

**Scenario 1:**
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps.
- Time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.
- The speed of the elevator is \( \frac{n - 20}{10} = v \).

**Scenario 2:**
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( n - 10 \) steps.
- Time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( n - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.
- The speed of the elevator is \( \frac{n - 10}{20} = v \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( \frac{n - 20}{10} = v \)
2. \( \frac{n - 10}{20} = v \)

Equating the two expressions for \( v \):
\[ \frac{n - 20}{10} = \frac{n - 10}{20} \]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( n \):
\[ 20(n - 20) = 10(n - 10) \]

Expanding both sides:
\[ 20n - 400 = 10n - 100 \]

Rearrange to solve for \( n \):
\[ 20n - 10n = 400 - 100 \]
\[ 10n = 300 \]
\[ n = 30 \]

Now substitute \( n = 30 \) back into one of the equations for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{30 - 20}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

1. **Determine the profit per bag:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25.

A)$27.30
B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance.

1. Let the cost price of the appliance be \( C \).

2. The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) is given by:
   \[
   S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C
   \]

3. The problem states that the gross profit is $20.00. Gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
   \[
   S - C = 20

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep.

Let's denote:
- \( d \) as the distance traveled by the jeep (in km).
- \( v \) as the speed of the jeep during the forward journey (in km/hr).

From the problem, we know:
1. The time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours.
2. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.
3. The speed during the return journey is \( v + 12 \) km/hr.

Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can write two equations:

For the forward journey:
\[ d = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey:
\[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since both expressions equal \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

Now, solve for \( v \):
\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]
\[ 6v - 4v = 48 \]
\[ 2v = 48 \]
\[ v = 24 \]

Now that we have \( v = 24 \) km/hr, we can find the distance \( d \) using the forward journey equation:
\[ d = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \]

Thus, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

A)20%
B)28%
C)36%
D)40%
E)42%",B,"To solve this problem, let's define the wholesale cost of the appliance as \( W \).

1. **Calculate the original retail price:**
   The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost.
   \[
   \text{Original Retail Price} = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
   \]

2. **Calculate the actual selling price:**
   The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 1.6W - 0.2 \times 1.6W = 1.6W \times (1 - 0.2) = 1.6W \times 0.8 = 1.28W
   \]

3. **Determine the percent increase over the wholesale cost:**
   The selling price is \( 1.28W \), and we need to find out how much more this is compared to the wholesale cost \( W \).
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 1.28W - W = 0.28W
   \]
   The percent increase over the wholesale cost is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{0.28W}{W}\right) \times 100\% = 28\%

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet and then calculate its area.

Let's denote the length and width of the original rectangle as \( L \) and \( W \), respectively.

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - This means the folded part has dimensions \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{L}{2} + W \right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     L + 2W = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - This means the folded part has dimensions \( L \) and \( \frac{W}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is given by:
     \[
     2 \left( L + \frac{W}{2} \right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2L + W = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

3. **Solving the system of equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     L + 2W = 48
     \]
     \[
     2L + W = 66
     \]
   - Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
     \[
     2L + 4W = 96
     \]
   - Subtract Equation 2 from this result:
     \[
     (2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66
     \]
     \[
     3W = 30
     \]
     \[
     W = 10
     \]

   - Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
     \[
     L + 2(10) = 48
     \]
     \[
     L + 20 = 48
     \]
     \[
     L = 28
     \]

4. **Calculate the area of the original sheet:**
   - The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
     \[
     A = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280
     \]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let's re-evaluate the area calculation:

\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions 3, 4, and 15:

2. The student incorrectly calculated \( \frac{7}{18} \times x \).
3. The difference between the correct and incorrect calculations is 770.

Set up the equation based on the difference:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770

Factor out \( x \):

\[
x \left( \frac{7}{8} - \frac{7}{18} \right) = 770

Find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{63}{72}, \quad \frac{7}{18} = \frac{28}{72}

Subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{63}{72} - \frac{28}{72} = \frac{35}{72}

Substitute back into the equation:

\[
x \times \frac{35}{72} = 770

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 770 \times \frac{72}{35}

Calculate:

\[
x = 770 \times \frac{72}{35} = 770 \times \frac{72}{35} = 22 \times 72 = 1584

1. The fixed salary is $500.
2. The additional salary is 5% of the monthly sales.

Let \( x \) be the monthly sales. The total salary \( S \) is given by:

\[ S = 500 + 0.05x \]

We want the total salary \( S \) to be $1500:

\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05x \]

Subtract 500 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05x \]

\[ 1000 = 0.05x \]

Divide both sides by 0.05 to find \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

\[ x = 20000 \]

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. **Distance Calculation:**
   Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, let's assume each side of the square is of length \(d\). Therefore, the total distance traveled is \(4d\).

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr = \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr = \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the third side at 600 km/hr = \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours.
   - Time taken to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr = \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours.

   Total time taken = \(\frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}\).

3. **Simplifying the Total Time:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 2400.
   - Convert each fraction:
     - \(\frac{d}{200} = \frac{12d}{2400}\)
     - \(\frac{d}{400} = \frac{6d}{2400}\)
     - \(\frac{d}{600} = \frac{4d}{2400}\)

   Total time = \(\frac{12d + 6d + 4d + 3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400}\).

4. **Average Speed Calculation:**
   Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).

   Average speed = \(\frac{4d}{\frac{25d}{2400}}\).

   Simplifying, we get:

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is 1 pool per 8 hours, or \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.

   - Principal amount borrowed = Rs.360
   - Total amount paid back = Rs.378
   - Total interest paid = 378 - 360 = Rs.18

3. **Calculate the interest rate:**
   - Interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis. Since the loan is for 1 year (12 months), we can use the formula for simple interest:
   \[
   \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Interest Paid}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   - Here, Time = 1 year, Total Interest Paid = Rs.18, Principal = Rs.360
   \[
   \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{18}{360 \times 1}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{18}{360}\right) \times 100 = 5\%

E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's monthly income based on his spending and savings rate.

1. Let's denote the man's monthly income as \( x \).

2. According to the problem, the man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12.5% of his income.

3. The savings rate of 12.5% can be expressed as a fraction: 
   \[
   12.5\% = \frac{12.5}{100} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

4. This means the man saves \(\frac{1}{8}\) of his income, so he spends the remaining \(\frac{7}{8}\) of his income.

5. We know that the amount he spends is Rs. 3500, which is \(\frac{7}{8}\) of his income:
   \[
   \frac{7}{8} \times x = 3500

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Determine the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Brown = \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Determine the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Black = \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**

E)11",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals as \( n \).

1. **Current Batting Average:**
   - Sachin's current batting average is 51. This means the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals is \( 51n \).

2. **Finals Performance:**
   - In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs.

3. **New Batting Average:**
   - After the finals, his batting average becomes 54. The total number of matches now is \( n + 1 \).

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - The new total runs scored is \( 51n + 78 \).
   - The new batting average is given by the equation:
     \[
     \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54

E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

1. **Single Letter Codes:**
   - If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. 
   - If we use \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes:**
   - If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book.
   - The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes:**
   - The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-of-letters codes: 
   \[
   n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}

4. **Finding the Minimum \( n \):**
   - We need at least 10 unique codes. Therefore, we solve:

   During this time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( s \times t \).

   The plane travels a distance of \( 10s \times t \).

   Since the plane catches up to the ship, the total distance traveled by the ship (180 miles + \( s \times t \)) is equal to the distance traveled by the plane (\( 10s \times t \)).

   \[
   180 + s \times t = 10s \times t
   \]

   Simplifying the equation:

   \[
   180 = 10s \times t - s \times t
   \]

   \[
   180 = 9s \times t
   \]

   \[
   t = \frac{180}{9s} = \frac{20}{s}
   \]

2. **Distance from the starting point when they meet:**

   The distance traveled by the ship from the starting point when they meet is:

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 180 + s \times t
   \]

   Substitute \( t = \frac{20}{s} \) into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 180 + s \times \frac{20}{s}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 180 + 20
   \]

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 200
   \]

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when the ship and the plane meet is 200 miles.

The correct answer is (C) 200.",True,,,

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
A)300
B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of proportions. The problem states that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, and in 2002, 500 deer were caught, of which 20 had tags. We are to assume that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population.

First, calculate the percentage of tagged deer in the sample:
\[
\text{Percentage of tagged deer in sample} = \left(\frac{20}{500}\right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This 4% is representative of the entire deer population. Therefore, 4% of the total deer population is equal to the 300 tagged deer.

Let \( x \) be the total deer population. Then:
\[
0.04x = 300

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{300}{0.04} = 7500

1. **First Condition:**
   - If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Arjun will have \( A - 30 \) and Sajal will have \( S + 30 \).
   - According to the problem, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
     \[
     S + 30 = 2(A - 30)

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Use the relationship between Raj's and Rahim's ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

3. **Solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**
   - The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%.
   - Let the cost price be \( CP \).
   - Selling Price (SP) = CP + 10% of CP = 1.10 * CP
   - Given SP = Rs 27.50, we have:
     \[
     1.10 \times CP = 27.50

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
