The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"A)5(√3 + 1)
------
A)5(√3 + 1)

(A)
------
To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. 

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) as the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know:
- The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.

Using the tangent function for the angles of elevation:
1. At 45°, \(\tan(45°) = 1\), so \( \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \) which implies \( x_1 = h \).
2. At 60°, \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]

The time taken to travel this distance is 10 minutes, so:
\[ v = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \)):
\[ t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} \]

Simplifying:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Thus:
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 15 + 5\sqrt{3} \]

This matches with the choice:
\[ 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Calculate the total production cost for the year:**
   - Monthly production = 420 units
   - Production cost per unit = $110
   - Total production cost per month = 420 units * $110 = $46,200
   - Total production cost for the year = $46,200 * 12 months = $554,400

2. **Calculate the required total revenue for the year:**
   - Required yearly profit = $626,400
   - Total production cost for the year = $554,400
   - Required total revenue = Total production cost + Required profit
   - Required total revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800

3. **Calculate the minimum selling price per component:**
   - Total units produced and sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
   - Required selling price per unit = Required total revenue / Total units
   - Required selling price per unit = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.68

D)4,800
------
To solve the problem, let's define the variables and equations:

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.
2. 10% of the staplers were defective, so the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).
3. The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).
4. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).
5. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so \( 0.018x = 72 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
0.018x = 72
\]

\[
x = \frac{72}{0.018}
\]

\[
x = 4000
\]

The number of staplers produced that day is 4000.

The correct answer is (A) 4,000.
------
To solve this problem, let's define the variables and equations:

Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced.

1. 10% of the staplers were defective, so 90% were non-defective.
   - Non-defective staplers = \( 0.9x \)

2. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
   - Rejected non-defective staplers = \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \)

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so:
\[ 0.018x = 72 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{72}{0.018} \]
\[ x = 4000 \]

Thus, the number of staplers produced that day is 4,000.

To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold this year = 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

3. Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22-month period:
   - Total sold over 22 months = 504 ovens (last year) + 200 ovens (this year) = 704 ovens.

4. Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the 22-month period:
   - Average = Total sold over 22 months / 22 months = 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.

21,,"Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"B)16
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of toys made by Alex, and \( y \) be the number of toys made by Jacob.
2. We know that \( x + y = 35 \).

3. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7x \).
4. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9y \).

5. Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7x \approx 9y
   \]

6. From the equation \( x + y = 35 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 35 - y
   \]

7. Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into the equation \( 7x \approx 9y \):
   \[
   7(35 - y) \approx 9y
   \]

8. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   245 - 7y \approx 9y
   \]

9. Combine like terms:
   \[
   245 \approx 16y
   \]

10. Solve for \( y \):
    \[
    y \approx \frac{245}{16} \approx 15.3125
    \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer, and the problem states they worked for almost the same number of hours, we round \( y \) to the nearest integer, which is 15.

Therefore, Jacob made 15 toys.

The correct answer is (A) 15.
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the equation:
\[ x + y = 35 \]

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7x \).
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9y \).

Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7x \approx 9y \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into the second equation:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer, and the closest integer to 15.3125 is 15, we conclude that Jacob made approximately 15 toys.

B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes on a windy day when his speed is reduced by 4 mph.

1. **Calculate Bill's speed on a windy day:**
   - Normal speed = 15 mph
   - Speed reduction = 4 mph
   - Windy day speed = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

2. **Convert 21 minutes to hours:**
   - 21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

3. **Calculate the distance traveled in 0.35 hours at 11 mph:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes is 3.85 miles.

The correct answer is (D).

A 5-digit number \( x \) has the property that when a 1 is placed after it, the resulting number is three times as large as when a 1 is placed before it. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ 10x + 1 = 3(100000 + x) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 10x + 1 = 300000 + 3x \]

Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[ 7x + 1 = 300000 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 299999 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = \frac{299999}{7} \]

Calculating the division:

\[ x = 42857 \]

Thus, the 5-digit number is 42857. We need to select the incorrect answer from the given options. The correct answer is (A) 42857, so the incorrect answer is any option other than (A).

A)1.5%
B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"(C)
------
(D)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount. The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. 

First, calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months:
12 installments * Rs.31.50 = Rs.378

The interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal amount borrowed:
Interest = Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18

Now, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to consider the interest paid over the year.

The formula for simple interest is:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, the principal is Rs.360, the interest is Rs.18, and the time is 1 year (since the installments are monthly over a year).

Rearranging the formula to solve for the rate gives us:
Rate = Interest / (Principal * Time)

Substitute the known values:
Rate = Rs.18 / (Rs.360 * 1) = 0.05

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:
Rate = 0.05 * 100 = 5%

Therefore, the interest rate is 5%.

The correct answer is (D) 5%.

   - Five dozen toys = 5 * 12 = 60 toys per box.

2. Calculate the number of toys in one tempo:
   - There are 98 boxes in one tempo.
   - Therefore, the number of toys in one tempo = 98 * 60 = 5880 toys.

3. Calculate the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys:

Ah, the tale of the ten juicy oranges! Imagine a basket filled with these vibrant fruits, and you are tasked with the delightful challenge of selecting just two. How many enchanting combinations can you conjure?

To solve this, we must delve into the realm of combinations, where order does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges to choose).

Let's calculate:

\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45

To solve this riddle, let's imagine three painters, each with their own unique pace. Mr. Brown, the swiftest, can paint a house in 6 days. Mr. Black, a bit more leisurely, takes 8 days, and Mr. Blue, the most meticulous, requires 12 days.

The task is to paint 3 houses. Mr. Brown starts the job and works for 8 days. In this time, he paints 8/6 of a house, which simplifies to 4/3 of a house.

Then, Mr. Black steps in for 6 days. In this period, he paints 6/8 of a house, which simplifies to 3/4 of a house.

Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have painted 4/3 + 3/4 of a house. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator:

4/3 = 16/12
3/4 = 9/12

Adding them gives us 25/12 of a house.

Now, the total work done is 25/12 of a house, and the total work needed is 3 houses, or 36/12 of a house. The remaining work is 36/12 - 25/12 = 11/12 of a house.

Mr. Blue, who paints at a rate of 1/12 of a house per day, will now take over. To finish the remaining 11/12 of a house, he will need 11 days.

So, the answer to this riddle is:

(D) 11

In the mystical land of Arithmoria, three legendary painters, Mr. Brown, Mr. Black, and Mr. Blue, were summoned by the King to paint the grand castles of the realm. Each painter wielded a magical brush with unique powers. Mr. Brown's brush could complete a castle in 6 days, Mr. Black's in 8 days, and Mr. Blue's in 12 days.

The quest began with Mr. Brown, who painted tirelessly for 8 days. His enchanted brush completed \( \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) of a castle. Then, Mr. Black took over, painting for 6 days, completing \( \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a castle.

Together, they had completed \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) of a castle. The magical contract required 3 castles to be painted, so the remaining work was \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) of a castle.

Now, it was Mr. Blue's turn. His brush, though slower, was steady and true. To complete the remaining \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a castle, Mr. Blue would need \( \frac{11}{12} \times 12 = 11 \) days.

Thus, the quest to paint the castles would be completed in an additional 11 days by Mr. Blue.

A suspenseful mystery unfolds at the bustling train station, where two trains, A and B, have just departed simultaneously. The question looms: when will this synchronized departure occur again? The answer lies in the scientific breakthrough of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals.

Train A departs every 16 minutes, while Train B departs every 17 minutes. To solve this mystery, we must calculate the LCM of 16 and 17. Since 16 and 17 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product.

The implications of this solution are profound. By understanding the LCM, we can predict future synchronized events, optimize scheduling, and enhance efficiency in various mathematical and real-world applications.

Now, the moment of truth: the LCM of 16 and 17 is 16 * 17 = 272 minutes. Thus, the trains will next leave the station simultaneously in 272 minutes.

57,,"In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
A)1%
B)2%
C)5%
D)9%
E)10%",D,"C)5%
------
(C)
------
C)5%
------
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.

2. **Cocoa Flavored Chocolates**: 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. So, 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.

3. **Vanilla Flavored Chocolates**: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored, the remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.

4. **Squashed Chocolates**: 90% of the remaining chocolates (which are vanilla flavored) are squashed. So, 90% of 90 chocolates are squashed, which is 81 chocolates.

5. **Vanilla Flavored and Not Squashed**: The chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed are the remaining vanilla chocolates that are not squashed. So, 90 (vanilla chocolates) - 81 (squashed chocolates) = 9 chocolates.

6. **Percentage of Vanilla Flavored and Not Squashed**: Out of the total 100 chocolates, 9 chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Therefore, the percentage is (9/100) * 100% = 9%.

Thus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.

The correct answer is (D) 9%.

58,,"There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?

B)26 days
C)27 days
D)28 days
E)29 days",D,"(C)27 days
------
C)27 days
------
(C)27 days
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the frog to climb out of the well given its daily progress.

Key components of the problem:
1. The well is 30 meters deep.
2. The frog jumps 3 meters up each day.
3. The frog falls back 2 meters each day.
4. We need to find out how many days it will take for the frog to reach or exceed the top of the well.

Explanation:
- Each day, the frog effectively climbs 1 meter (3 meters up - 2 meters down).
- However, on the day the frog reaches the top, it will not fall back because it will have already exited the well.

Let's break it down:
- After 27 days, the frog will have climbed 27 meters (27 days * 1 meter per day).
- On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters up from 27 meters, reaching 30 meters, and will exit the well without falling back.

Therefore, it will take the frog 28 days to climb out of the well.

Feasibility and impact:
- The calculation is straightforward and accounts for the frog's daily progress and the final jump out of the well.
- The impact of each jump and fall is considered, ensuring the solution is accurate.

To solve the problem, let's break it down into equations:

Let Arjun have $A and Sajal have $S.

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have $S + 30, and Arjun will have $A - 30. According to the problem, Sajal will then have twice the money left with Arjun:
   \[
   S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
   \]

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have $A + 10, and Sajal will have $S - 10. According to the problem, Arjun will then have thrice the money left with Sajal:
   \[
   A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 1:
\[
S + 30 = 2A - 60
\]
\[
S = 2A - 90
\]

From equation 2:
\[
A + 10 = 3S - 30
\]
\[
A = 3S - 40
\]

Substitute \(S = 2A - 90\) into \(A = 3S - 40\):
\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]
\[
A = 6A - 310
\]
\[
5A = 310
\]
\[
A = 62
\]

Substitute \(A = 62\) back into \(S = 2A - 90\):
\[
S = 2(62) - 90
\]
\[
S = 124 - 90
\]
\[
S = 34
\]

Thus, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

Given:
- GCF(a, b) = 11
- LCM(a, b) = 7700
- One of the integers, a = 350

We need to find the other integer, b.

Step-by-step solution:

(A) Use the relationship between GCF, LCM, and the integers:
   11 * 7700 = 350 * b

(B) Calculate the product of GCF and LCM:
   11 * 7700 = 84700

(C) Set up the equation to solve for b:
   84700 = 350 * b

(D) Solve for b by dividing both sides by 350:
   b = 84700 / 350

(E) Perform the division:
   b = 242

Thus, the other integer is 242.

(B) We are given that the GCF is 11, the LCM is 7700, and one of the integers (a) is 350. We need to find the other integer (b).

(C) Substitute the known values into the formula: 11 * 7700 = 350 * b.

(D) Calculate the left side: 11 * 7700 = 84700.

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"(A) First, let's denote the side length of the original square piece of cloth as \( s \).

(B) When the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

(C) The rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is calculated as:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
For one of the triangles, the base and height are \( s \) and \( s - 4 \), respectively. Therefore:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
\]
\[
s \times (s - 4) = 140
\]
\[
s^2 - 4s = 140
\]
\[
s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
\]

(D) Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \):
\[
s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}

\[
s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}

The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
\[
s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10

E)12",A,"(A) To solve the problem, we need to understand that the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, and it is reduced in the ratio 5:3.

(B) The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

(C) To find the new length, we can set up a proportion: 
   Original length / New length = 5 / 3.

(D) Let the new length be x. Then, 30 / x = 5 / 3.

(E) Solving for x, we cross-multiply to get:
   5x = 30 * 3,
   5x = 90,
   x = 90 / 5,
   x = 18.

The new length of the ribbon is 18 cm.

A)18
------
To solve the problem, we need to understand the concept of ratio reduction and apply it to the given length of the ribbon.

(A) **Understanding the Ratio**: The original length of the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that for every 5 units of the original length, it is now reduced to 3 units.

(B) **Setting Up the Equation**: Let the original length of the ribbon be represented by 5 parts. The new length will be represented by 3 parts. We need to find out what 1 part is in terms of the original length.

(C) **Calculating the Length of One Part**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, which corresponds to 5 parts. Therefore, each part is 30 cm / 5 = 6 cm.

(D) **Finding the New Length**: Since the new length is 3 parts, we multiply the length of one part by 3. Thus, the new length is 3 parts * 6 cm/part = 18 cm.

(E) **Conclusion**: The length of the ribbon now is 18 cm.

The correct answer is:
A) 18
------
(A)18
------
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratio reduction and apply it to find the new length of the ribbon.

(A) Key components of the problem:
1. Original length of the ribbon: 30 cm.
2. Reduction ratio: 5:3.

(B) Potential strategies for solving the problem:
1. Understand the ratio reduction: A ratio of 5:3 means that for every 5 units of the original length, it is reduced to 3 units.
2. Calculate the new length using the ratio.

(C) Systematic application of the strategy:
1. The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, which corresponds to the '5' part of the ratio.
2. To find the length corresponding to the '3' part of the ratio, we set up a proportion: 
   (Original length / Original ratio part) = (New length / New ratio part)
   (30 / 5) = (New length / 3)
3. Solve for the new length:
   New length = (30 / 5) * 3
   New length = 6 * 3
   New length = 18 cm

(D) Explanation of reasoning:
- The ratio 5:3 indicates that the original length is divided into 5 parts, and the new length is 3 parts of the same size.
- By dividing the original length by 5, we find the size of one part.
- Multiplying the size of one part by 3 gives us the new length.

91,,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500
\]
\[
= 1680
\]

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680.

The correct answer is (B) Rs.1680.

104,,"Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other?
A)12 am on the next day
B)5 am on the next day
C)5 pm on the next day
D)2 pm on the next day
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when Train B will catch up to Train A.

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, so Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Train A travels at 40 kmph and Train B travels at 72 kmph.
   - The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is: \(72 \text{ kmph} - 40 \text{ kmph} = 32 \text{ kmph}\).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up:**
   - Train B needs to cover the 120 km head start of Train A.
   - Time taken to catch up is: \(\frac{120 \text{ km}}{32 \text{ kmph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train B leaves at 2 pm. Adding 3.75 hours to 2 pm gives us:
     - 2 pm + 3 hours = 5 pm
     - 5 pm + 0.75 hours (which is 45 minutes) = 5:45 pm

Since the trains meet at 5:45 pm on the same day, none of the given options match this time exactly. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) None of these

   - Train B needs to cover the 120 km head start.
   - Time taken to catch up: \(\frac{120 \text{ km}}{32 \text{ kmph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Determine the meeting time:**
   - Train B leaves at 2 pm and takes 3.75 hours to catch up.
   - 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.
   - Adding 3 hours and 45 minutes to 2 pm results in 5:45 pm on the same day.

1. Calculate the total work done by 8 men in 6 days:
   - Work = Number of men × Number of days
   - Total work = 8 men × 6 days = 48 man-days

2. Determine how many men are needed to complete the same work in 1/2 day:
   - Let x be the number of men required.
   - Work = x men × 1/2 day = 48 man-days
   - x/2 = 48

In the bustling town of Numerica, there lived three siblings: Algie, Betty, and Charlie. They were known for their unique ability to transform into numbers. One day, they decided to play a game where they would form a three-digit number using their ages, which were represented by the digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

The rules of the game were simple: the sum of their ages had to be 17, and the sum of the squares of their ages had to be 109. Additionally, if they subtracted 495 from the number they formed, the result would be a number with their ages in reverse order.

Algie, the eldest, suggested they start with the number 368. They checked the conditions:
- The sum of the digits: \(3 + 6 + 8 = 17\).
- The sum of the squares of the digits: \(3^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 36 + 64 = 109\).
- Subtracting 495 from 368 gives: \(368 - 495 = -127\), which doesn't match the reverse order.

Betty, the middle child, proposed they try 377. They verified:
- The sum of the digits: \(3 + 7 + 7 = 17\).
- The sum of the squares of the digits: \(3^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 + 49 = 107\), which doesn't match.

Charlie, the youngest, suggested 288. They checked:
- The sum of the digits: \(2 + 8 + 8 = 18\), which doesn't match.

Finally, they tried 997:
- The sum of the digits: \(9 + 9 + 7 = 25\), which doesn't match.

Then, they considered 112:
- The sum of the digits: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\), which doesn't match.

After much deliberation, they realized they had made a mistake in their calculations. Returning to 368, they found:
- The sum of the digits: \(3 + 6 + 8 = 17\).
- The sum of the squares of the digits: \(3^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 36 + 64 = 109\).
- Subtracting 495 from 863 (the correct number) gives: \(863 - 495 = 368\), which matches the reverse order.

Thus, the number they were looking for was indeed 368. The siblings celebrated their discovery with a grand feast in Numerica.

To determine how many senators can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to calculate the proportion of the total bribery pool contributed by Hoopsmot and apply that proportion to the total number of senators influenced.

1. Calculate the total bribery pool:
   \[
   \text{Total Bribery Pool} = \$16,000 + \$4,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. Calculate the proportion of the pool contributed by Hoopsmot:
   \[
   \text{Hoopsmot's Proportion} = \frac{\$16,000}{\$20,000} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

3. Apply this proportion to the total number of senators:
   \[
   \text{Senators influenced by Hoopsmot} = \frac{4}{5} \times 30 = 24
   \]

Therefore, the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's is 24.

To solve the given mathematical puzzle, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:

1. Calculate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: 
   \[
   272 - 32 = 240
   \]

2. Calculate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:
   \[
   124 + 176 = 300
   \]

3. Multiply the results of the two parentheses:
   \[
   240 \times 300 = 72000
   \]

4. Calculate the expression in the denominator:
   \[
   17 \times 15 - 15 = 255 - 15 = 240
   \]

5. Divide the result of the multiplication by the result of the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{72000}{240} = 300
   \]

Thus, the value of the expression is 300. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C)
------
To solve the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets**: Solve the expressions inside the brackets first.
   - \(272 - 32 = 240\)
   - \(124 + 176 = 300\)

2. **Multiplication**: Multiply the results from the parentheses.
   - \(240 \times 300 = 72000\)

3. **Parentheses/Brackets**: Solve the expression in the denominator.
   - \(17 \times 15 = 255\)
   - \(255 - 15 = 240\)

4. **Division**: Divide the result from the multiplication by the result from the denominator.
   - \(\frac{72000}{240} = 300\)

The final result is 300.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow.

1. Calculate the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{17.5}{40.25}
   \]

2. Set up the proportion for the building:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Height of building}}{28.75} = \frac{17.5}{40.25}
   \]

3. Solve for the height of the building:
   \[
   \text{Height of building} = \frac{17.5}{40.25} \times 28.75
   \]

4. Calculate the height:
   \[
   \text{Height of building} = \frac{17.5 \times 28.75}{40.25}
   \]

5. Perform the multiplication and division:
   \[

A)2: π
B)7:2

------
(E)
------
To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the volume of a cube to the volume of a sphere that fits inside the cube.

1. **Identify the side length of the cube and the diameter of the sphere:**
   - Let the side length of the cube be \( s \).
   - The sphere that fits inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube, so the diameter of the sphere is \( s \).

2. **Calculate the volume of the cube:**
   - The volume of the cube, \( V_{\text{cube}} \), is given by the formula:
     \[
     V_{\text{cube}} = s^3
     \]

3. **Calculate the volume of the sphere:**
   - The radius of the sphere, \( r \), is half of the diameter, so \( r = \frac{s}{2} \).
   - The volume of the sphere, \( V_{\text{sphere}} \), is given by the formula:
     \[
     V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{s^3}{8} = \frac{\pi s^3}{6}
     \]

4. **Find the ratio of the volumes:**
   - The ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere is:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{V_{\text{cube}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{s^3}{\frac{\pi s^3}{6}} = \frac{6s^3}{\pi s^3} = \frac{6}{\pi}
     \]

5. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The ratio of the volumes is \( \frac{6}{\pi} \), which corresponds to option (D).

148,,"Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
A)50 %
B)60 %
C)55 %
D)70 %
E)58%",A,"B)60 %
------
(B)
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP) of the oranges, and then determine the percentage gain.

1. **Cost Price (CP):** The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. Therefore, the cost price is Rs. 450.

2. **Selling Price (SP):** The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg. Therefore, the selling price for 90 kg is 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.

3. **Profit:** Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Profit = SP - CP = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.

4. **Percentage Gain:** The percentage gain is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{225}{450} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

- **(A) 50%:** This matches our calculated percentage gain. It is correct.
- **(B) 60%:** This is incorrect because the calculated gain is 50%, not 60%.
- **(C) 55%:** This is incorrect because the calculated gain is 50%, not 55%.
- **(D) 70%:** This is incorrect because the calculated gain is 50%, not 70%.
- **(E) 58%:** This is incorrect because the calculated gain is 50%, not 58%.

The correct answer is (A) 50%.
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost price per kg and the selling price per kg, then determine the percentage gain.

1. **Cost Price (CP) per kg:**
   - Total cost for 90 kg = Rs. 450
   - CP per kg = Total cost / Total kg = 450 / 90 = Rs. 5 per kg

2. **Selling Price (SP) per kg:**
   - Given SP per kg = Rs. 7.50

3. **Gain per kg:**
   - Gain per kg = SP per kg - CP per kg = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50

4. **Percentage Gain:**
   - Percentage Gain = (Gain per kg / CP per kg) * 100
   - Percentage Gain = (2.50 / 5) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the percentage gain is 50%.

(A) 50 %
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP) of the oranges, and then determine the percentage gain.

1. **Cost Price (CP):** The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. Therefore, the cost price is Rs. 450.

2. **Selling Price (SP):** The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg. Therefore, the selling price for 90 kg is:
   \[
   SP = 90 \, \text{kg} \times 7.50 \, \text{Rs/kg} = 675 \, \text{Rs}
   \]

3. **Profit:** The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = SP - CP = 675 \, \text{Rs} - 450 \, \text{Rs} = 225 \, \text{Rs}
   \]

4. **Percentage Gain:** The percentage gain is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{225}{450} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

A)$8
B)$10
C)$13.6
D)$22.9
E)$40",C,"(C)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of each article and then find the new price after the 15% decrease.

1. Let the original price of each article be \( x \).

2. After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article is \( x - 0.15x = 0.85x \).

3. With the new price, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. This means the number of articles she can buy at the new price is \( n + 5 \), where \( n \) is the number of articles she could buy at the original price.

4. The equation for the number of articles she can buy at the new price is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{0.85x} = n + 5
   \]

5. The equation for the number of articles she could buy at the original price is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{x} = n
   \]

6. Substitute \( n \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   \frac{300}{0.85x} = \frac{300}{x} + 5
   \]

7. Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{300}{0.85x} - \frac{300}{x} = 5
   \]

8. Find a common denominator and solve:
   \[
   \frac{300x - 300 \times 0.85x}{0.85x^2} = 5
   \]

9. Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{300x - 255x}{0.85x^2} = 5
   \]

10. Further simplify:
    \[
    \frac{45x}{0.85x^2} = 5
    \]

11. Cancel \( x \) from numerator and denominator:
    \[
    \frac{45}{0.85x} = 5
    \]

12. Solve for \( x \):
    \[
    45 = 5 \times 0.85x
    \]

13. Divide both sides by 5:
    \[
    9 = 0.85x
    \]

14. Solve for \( x \):
    \[
    x = \frac{9}{0.85}
    \]

15. Calculate \( x \):
    \[
    x \approx 10.588
    \]

16. The new price of each article is \( 0.85x \):
    \[
    0.85 \times 10.588 \approx 9
    \]

17. The closest option to the calculated new price is \( 10 \).

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is \( \boxed{10} \).

The correct answer is (B).

In the whimsical land of Floralia, there lived a pair of flower fairies named Lily and Rose. They were tasked with creating identical bouquets for the grand Tulip Festival. Lily had 28 white tulips, and Rose had 98 red tulips. Their challenge was to make the greatest number of identical bouquets without leaving any tulips behind.

Lily and Rose decided to consult the wise old Gardener GCD, who was known for his ability to find the greatest common divisor of any two numbers. The Gardener GCD pondered for a moment and then declared, ""To make the greatest number of identical bouquets, you must find the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98.""

Lily and Rose quickly set to work, dividing their tulips into groups. They discovered that the greatest number of identical bouquets they could make was 14, as 14 was the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98.

With this knowledge, they joyfully created 14 identical bouquets, each containing 2 white tulips and 7 red tulips, and the Tulip Festival was a blooming success.

The answer is (D) 14.

In the whimsical land of Floralia, there lived a talented florist named Petalina. She was known far and wide for her magical bouquets that could brighten even the gloomiest of days. One sunny morning, Petalina received a special request from the Queen of Floralia. The Queen wanted to host a grand festival and needed the greatest number of identical bouquets made from her garden's 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, with none left behind.

Petalina, with her enchanted abacus, set out on a journey to find the perfect number of identical bouquets. She knew that the key to her quest lay in finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, for it would reveal the maximum number of identical bouquets she could create.

As she wandered through the fields, she encountered the wise old Owl of Arithmetic, who whispered the secret of the GCD into her ear. Petalina learned that the GCD of 28 and 98 was the largest number that could divide both quantities without leaving any remainder.

With a twinkle in her eye, Petalina used her newfound knowledge to calculate the GCD. She discovered that the greatest number of identical bouquets she could make was 14, as it was the largest number that divided both 28 and 98 perfectly.

Returning to the Queen with her magical bouquets, Petalina was celebrated as a hero, and the festival was a resounding success. The land of Floralia was filled with joy and color, all thanks to Petalina's enchanting creations.

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.

A)8%
B)10%
C)12.5%
D)16.7%
E)25%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the cost of repairing to the cost of purchasing new tires.

1. **Cost of New Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $180
   - Lifespan = 4 years
   - Average cost per year = $180 / 4 = $45

2. **Cost of Repairing Current Tires:**
   - Cost per tire = $40
   - Lifespan extension = 1 year
   - Average cost per year = $40 / 1 = $40

3. **Percentage Increase Calculation:**
   - Increase in cost = $45 (new tires) - $40 (repair) = $5
   - Percentage increase = ($5 / $40) * 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

The correct answer is (C) 12.5%.
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing current tires, and then determine the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost.

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - Cost of new tires = $180 per tire
   - Lifespan of new tires = 4 years
   - Average cost per year for new tires = $180 / 4 = $45 per year

2. **Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires:**
   - Cost of repairing current tires = $40 per tire
   - Lifespan extension from repair = 1 year
   - Average cost per year for repaired tires = $40 / 1 = $40 per year

3. **Calculate the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost:**
   - Difference in cost per year = $45 (new tires) - $40 (repaired tires) = $5
   - Percentage increase = ($5 / $40) * 100% = 12.5%

The average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

B)$618
C)$216
D)$202
E)$200",B,"(C)
------
(B)
------
(C)
------
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued on the bond using the formula for compound interest. The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 5000 \)
- \( r = 0.12 \)
- \( n = 2 \) (since interest is compounded every six months)
- \( t = 1 \)

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]
\[ A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2} \]
\[ A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 \]
\[ A = 5000 \times 1.1236 \]
\[ A = 5618 \]

The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:

\[ \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618 \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $618.

191,,"A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
A)Rs. 6
B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost of each pen, given the conditions of the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.
   - Each pen is sold at Rs. 10.
   - The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens.
   - 10% of the manufactured pens are defective and rejected.

2. **Calculating Total Revenue:**
   - The total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 7200 \times 10 = Rs. 72,000
     \]

3. **Understanding Profit:**
   - The profit is 25% of the total cost of manufacturing all pens (including defective ones).
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of manufacturing all pens.
   - The profit is given by:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times C
     \]

4. **Relating Revenue and Cost:**
   - The revenue is equal to the total cost plus the profit:
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = C + \text{Profit} = C + 0.25C = 1.25C
     \]
   - We know the revenue is Rs. 72,000, so:
     \[
     1.25C = 72,000
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{72,000}{1.25} = 57,600
     \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Manufactured Pens:**
   - Since 10% of the pens are defective, 90% of the manufactured pens are non-defective.
   - Let \( N \) be the total number of manufactured pens.
   - 90% of \( N \) equals the 7200 pens delivered:
     \[
     0.9N = 7200
     \]
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000
     \]

6. **Calculating the Manufacturing Cost per Pen:**
   - The total cost \( C \) is Rs. 57,600 for 8000 pens.
   - The cost per pen is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pen} = \frac{57,600}{8000} = Rs. 7.2
     \]

Therefore, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.

The correct answer is (B).
------
In the bustling town of Inkville, there was a renowned pen company known for its exquisite writing instruments. The company had a magical assembly line where pens were crafted with precision and care. However, a mischievous sprite named Defecto would occasionally tamper with the pens, causing 10% of them to be defective and unfit for sale.

Despite Defecto's antics, the company had a promise to fulfill: delivering 7200 perfect pens to their loyal wholesaler. Each pen was sold for Rs. 10, and the company aimed for a 25% profit on all the pens they manufactured, including the ones Defecto had meddled with.

To uncover the mystery of the manufacturing cost per pen, the company embarked on a journey of calculations. They knew that to deliver 7200 perfect pens, they needed to produce more, accounting for the 10% that Defecto would spoil. Thus, they calculated the total number of pens to be produced as 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens.

The total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each was Rs. 72,000. With a 25% profit margin, the total cost of manufacturing all 8000 pens was determined by the equation:

Total Cost = Total Revenue / (1 + Profit Margin)
Total Cost = 72,000 / 1.25 = Rs. 57,600

Now, to find the cost of manufacturing each pen, they divided the total cost by the number of pens produced:

Cost per pen = Total Cost / Total Pens Produced
Cost per pen = 57,600 / 8000 = Rs. 7.2

Thus, the magical number that revealed the manufacturing cost of each pen was Rs. 7.2. The company celebrated their discovery, ensuring they could continue crafting their fine pens while keeping Defecto's mischief in check.

In the magical realm of Numeria, there lived a curious number known as the Two-Digit Enigma. This number had a peculiar property: it was always 18 more than the sum of its own digits. Furthermore, the number had a special relationship between its digits: the digit in the unit's place was twice as magical as the digit in the ten's place.

The wise Numerian wizards decided to solve this mystery. They named the digit in the ten's place ""T"" and the digit in the unit's place ""U"". According to the magical rules, the number could be expressed as 10T + U. The sum of its digits was T + U, and the number was 18 more than this sum:

10T + U = T + U + 18.

The wizards also knew that the unit's digit was twice the ten's digit:

U = 2T.

With these two spells, they set out to find the number. Substituting the second spell into the first, they had:

10T + 2T = T + 2T + 18.

Simplifying the equation, they found:

12T = 3T + 18.

Subtracting 3T from both sides, they got:

9T = 18.

Dividing by 9, they discovered:

T = 2.

With T known, they used the second spell to find U:

U = 2T = 2 * 2 = 4.

Thus, the magical number was 10T + U = 10*2 + 4 = 24.

The wizards rejoiced, for they had uncovered the Two-Digit Enigma. The number was indeed 24.

(B)

C)42
------
In the magical realm of Numerica, there lived a curious two-digit creature named Numby. Numby had a peculiar trait: it always exceeded the sum of its own digits by 18. Moreover, Numby had a special relationship with its digits, where the digit at the unit's place was always double the digit in the ten's place.

One day, the wise wizard of Numerica, Arithmetix, decided to solve the mystery of Numby's identity. He knew that if the digit in the ten's place was represented by 'x', then the unit's place would be '2x'. Thus, Numby could be expressed as 10x + 2x, which simplified to 12x.

Arithmetix also knew that the sum of Numby's digits was x + 2x, which equaled 3x. According to the magical rule, Numby exceeded this sum by 18, so:

12x = 3x + 18

The wizard subtracted 3x from both sides, leaving:

9x = 18

Dividing both sides by 9, Arithmetix found:

x = 2

Thus, the digit in the ten's place was 2, and the unit's place was 4 (since it was double the ten's place). Therefore, Numby was 24.

With a flourish of his wand, Arithmetix declared the answer to the realm:

B)After 12 minutes
------
To find when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which they ring: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
- 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
- 40 = 2^3 * 5
- 48 = 2^4 * 3

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^4.
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2.
- The highest power of 5 is 5^1.

Therefore, the LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 seconds.

To convert 720 seconds into minutes, we divide by 60:
720 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 12 minutes.

Thus, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

Once upon a time, there was a magical car named Zephyr that could change its speed with a simple wish. Zephyr was on a mission to deliver a special package to the Kingdom of Velocity. The journey was long, spanning a distance that took 20 hours to cover at a steady speed of 60 km/hr. Zephyr enjoyed the scenic route, passing through enchanted forests and over sparkling rivers.

However, on the return trip, Zephyr received an urgent message from the Kingdom of Velocity. The package needed to be delivered in half the time! Zephyr, determined to fulfill the mission, wished for more speed. With a burst of magical energy, Zephyr's speed increased, allowing the journey to be completed in just 10 hours.

To calculate the new speed, we know the original distance was 60 km/hr * 20 hours = 1200 km. To cover this distance in 10 hours, Zephyr needed to travel at a speed of 1200 km / 10 hours = 120 km/hr.

Thus, Zephyr gained a speed of 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

B)7
C)3
D)8
E)12",C,"(D)
------

------
B)7
------
To have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be greater than zero. The discriminant for the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( b^2 - 4ac \).

For the equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \), we have:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -5 \)
- \( c = k \)

The discriminant is:
\[ (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k \]

For the roots to be real and distinct, we need:
\[ 25 - 4k > 0 \]

Solving for \( k \):
\[ 25 > 4k \]
\[ \frac{25}{4} > k \]
\[ 6.25 > k \]

The largest integer value of \( k \) that satisfies this inequality is 6.

However, the choices provided do not include 6. The closest option is 7, but 7 does not satisfy the inequality \( 6.25 > k \). Therefore, the correct answer should be the largest integer less than 6.25, which is 6, but since 6 is not an option, we must choose the closest available option that is less than 6.25, which is 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C)
------
In the thrilling adventure of the Enchanted Quadratic Forest, our hero, Arin, must find the largest integral value of 'k' to unlock the ancient gate that leads to the hidden realm of Real and Distinct Roots. The gate is guarded by the mystical Discriminant, which demands that the value of the discriminant (b² - 4ac) be greater than zero for the gate to open.

Arin knows the equation of the gate is x² - 5x + k = 0. To find the key, Arin calculates the discriminant: 

Discriminant = b² - 4ac = (-5)² - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k.

For the gate to open, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

25 - 4k > 0

Arin rearranges the inequality:

25 > 4k

Dividing both sides by 4, Arin finds:

k < 6.25

The largest integral value of 'k' that satisfies this condition is 6. Arin triumphantly approaches the gate with the value of 'k' set to 6, and the gate swings open, revealing the path to the hidden realm.

Plot Hole: The choices provided do not include the correct answer based on the calculation. The largest integral value of 'k' should be 6, but it is not listed among the options.

Summary: Arin, the hero, calculates the discriminant of the quadratic equation to find the largest integral value of 'k' that allows the equation to have two real and distinct roots. The correct value is 6, but it is missing from the options.

Choose the hero's next move:
A) Arin decides to explore the Enchanted Quadratic Forest further to find another way to open the gate.
B) Arin consults the ancient scrolls to see if there is a mistake in the options provided.
C) Arin uses the value of 'k' as 9, hoping it will still open the gate.

A)9 hours.
B)10 hours.
C)11 hours.
D)12 hours.
E)13 hours.",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km, including her rest breaks.

1. **Calculate the time taken to ride 15 km:**
   - Shweta rides at 10 km per hour.
   - Time to ride 15 km = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - 100 km / 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder.
   - 6 segments cover 90 km, leaving 10 km remaining.

3. **Calculate the rest time for 6 segments:**
   - Shweta rests for 10 minutes (or 1/6 of an hour) at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - Total rest time for 6 segments = 6 * (1/6) hour = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the time to ride the remaining 10 km:**
   - Time to ride 10 km = 10 km / 10 km per hour = 1 hour.

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total riding time for 90 km = 6 * 1.5 hours = 9 hours.
   - Total rest time = 1 hour.
   - Time to ride the remaining 10 km = 1 hour.
   - Total time = 9 hours + 1 hour + 1 hour = 11 hours.

Therefore, Shweta will take a total of 11 hours to cover 100 km.

The correct answer is (C) 11 hours.

(C)11 hours.

In a land where time was measured not by clocks but by the rhythm of the heart, there lived a traveler named Shweta. She embarked on a journey across the vast plains, where the horizon stretched endlessly, and the wind whispered secrets of the earth.

Shweta rode her trusty bicycle at a steady pace of 10 km per hour. Her journey was not just about reaching a destination but savoring the moments in between. Every 15 km, she would pause, not out of necessity, but to listen to the stories carried by the breeze and to rest her soul for 10 minutes.

As she pedaled through the landscape, she covered the first 15 km in 1.5 hours. She paused, closed her eyes, and let the world speak to her for 10 minutes. This pattern continued, a dance of movement and stillness, until she had traveled 90 km, taking 9 hours of riding and 6 breaks, each 10 minutes long, adding up to an hour of rest.

With 90 km behind her, Shweta had only 10 km left to reach her destination. She rode this final stretch in 1 hour, her heart full of the stories she had gathered along the way.

In total, Shweta's journey took her 10 hours, a testament to the beauty of balance between motion and rest, between the destination and the journey itself.

Her pace was steady, riding at 10 kilometers per hour. However, every 15 kilometers, she would pause for a brief respite, resting for 10 minutes to gather her strength.

As she pedaled through the countryside, the rhythm of her journey was marked by these intervals of rest. For every 15 kilometers she conquered, she would stop, breathe, and then continue on her way. 

To reach her destination, Shweta needed to cover 100 kilometers. She calculated her journey: for every 15 kilometers, she would ride for 1.5 hours and then rest for 10 minutes. This pattern would repeat until she reached her goal.

After 90 kilometers, she had taken 6 rest breaks, each adding 10 minutes to her journey. These breaks totaled 60 minutes, or 1 hour. The final stretch of 10 kilometers required no rest, as it was the last leg of her journey.

Thus, her total riding time was 10 hours, and with the additional hour of rest, her journey spanned 11 hours in total. 

And so, with the sun setting on the horizon, Shweta completed her journey, having learned that patience and perseverance are as important as speed.

In the bustling town of Mathville, there was a school known for its challenging tests. One day, the students of Mathville High took a particularly tough exam. The students who passed the test were known to have an average score of 83, while those who didn't quite make the cut had an average of 55. The entire class, when their scores were combined, had an average of 76.

The wise old teacher, Mr. Numbers, wanted to know what percentage of his students had passed the test. He knew that the overall class average was a blend of the passing and failing students' averages. 

Mr. Numbers imagined the class as a grand orchestra, where the passing students played a harmonious tune at 83, and the failing students played a somber melody at 55. Together, they created a symphony that resonated at 76. 

To find out the percentage of students who played the harmonious tune, Mr. Numbers set up an equation, balancing the contributions of both groups to the overall melody. After some calculations, he discovered the answer hidden within the notes of the symphony.

The percentage of students who passed the test was revealed to be:

------
(A)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of B bottles in dollars, given that 27 bottles cost A cents.

1. First, find the cost of one bottle in cents. Since 27 bottles cost A cents, the cost of one bottle is A/27 cents.

2. Next, find the cost of B bottles in cents. Since one bottle costs A/27 cents, B bottles will cost (A/27) * B = AB/27 cents.

3. Convert the cost from cents to dollars. Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost in dollars is (AB/27) / 100 = AB/2700 dollars.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) AB/2700.

246,,"Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
A)58
B)62
C)66
D)70
E)74",A,"(C)
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know one side is unfenced and is 10 meters, so either \( L = 10 \) or \( W = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the other dimension using the area:**
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters.
   - If \( L = 10 \), then \( 10 \times W = 240 \).
   - Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) meters.

3. **Determine the amount of fencing needed:**
   - Alice wants to fence three sides: two widths and one length.
   - The total fencing required is \( 2W + L \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( 2(24) + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \) meters.

Therefore, Alice needs 58 meters of fencing.

The correct answer is (A).

To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729.

1. Calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:
   \[
   727 + 728 + 729 = 2184
   \]

2. Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

3. The product of these integers is:
   \[
   (n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n
   \]

4. Set the product equal to 2184:
   \[
   n^3 - n = 2184
   \]

5. We need to find an integer \( n \) such that this equation holds. Testing small values of \( n \):

   - For \( n = 13 \):
     \[
     13^3 - 13 = 2197 - 13 = 2184
     \]

   This satisfies the equation.

6. The three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14.

7. Calculate their sum:
   \[
   12 + 13 + 14 = 39
   \]

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 39.
