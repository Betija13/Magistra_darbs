0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of uniform speed.

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.

From the trigonometric identities:
- When the angle of elevation is 45°, \(\tan(45°) = 1\), so \( h = x_1 \).
- When the angle of elevation is 60°, \(\tan(60°) = \sqrt{3}\), so \( h = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \).

Since \( h = x_1 \) and \( h = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \), we have:
\[ x_1 = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} \]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled in this time is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = x_2 \cdot \sqrt{3} - x_2 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1) \]

The speed of the car is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10} \]

The time \( t \) it takes to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base (distance \( x_2 \)) is:
\[ t = \frac{x_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{x_2}{\frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[ \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's denote the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \( 0.78x \) (since 100% - 22% = 78%).

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is \( 0.78x - 20 \).

3. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the equation is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8

   Simplify:
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8

   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8

A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find a number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12. A number that is a multiple of both 9 and 12 must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM).

First, let's find the LCM of 9 and 12:

- The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\).
- The prime factorization of 12 is \(2^2 \times 3\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

- For the prime 2, the highest power is \(2^2\).
- For the prime 3, the highest power is \(3^2\).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36\).

Now, we check the choices to see which one is a multiple of 36:

A) 36 is a multiple of 36 (since 36 divided by 36 equals 1).
B) 15 is not a multiple of 36.

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to calculate the probability that both stocks do not increase.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144 \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is simply the maximum of the two individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ \max(0.44, 0.26) = 0.44 \]

But since the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, we should consider the complement of the union of the two events:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - P(\text{A or B increases}) \]

Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events:

\[ P(\text{A or B increases}) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B) \]

The maximum value for \(P(A \text{ and } B)\) is 0.56 (since \(P(A) = 0.56\) and \(P(B) = 0.74\), the maximum overlap is limited by the smaller probability).

Thus, the minimum value for \(P(\text{A or B increases})\) is:

\[ P(\text{A or B increases}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74 \]

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \]

B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand that the selling price (SP) is 20% more than the cost price (CP). 

The relationship between the selling price and the cost price when there is a profit of 20% is given by:
\[ \text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.20 \times \text{CP} = 1.20 \times \text{CP} \]

We know the selling price (SP) is Rs.360. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.20 \times \text{CP} = 360 \]

To find the cost price (CP), we solve for CP:
\[ \text{CP} = \frac{360}{1.20} \]

\[ \text{CP} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

We know:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (total toys made by both).
2. Alex takes 7 hours per toy, so he worked \( 7A \) hours.
3. Jacob takes 9 hours per toy, so he worked \( 9J \) hours.
4. They worked for almost the same number of hours, so \( 7A \approx 9J \).

From the equation \( 7A \approx 9J \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ A \approx \frac{9}{7}J \]

Substitute \( A \approx \frac{9}{7}J \) into the total toys equation:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + J = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + \frac{7}{7}J = 35 \]
\[ \frac{16}{7}J = 35 \]

Solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 35 \times \frac{7}{16} \]
\[ J = \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J = 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number, and the problem states they worked for almost the same number of hours, the closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - Speed increased by 12 km/hr, so the new speed = \( v + 12 \) km/hr

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the folding process and how it affects the perimeter.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as length \( L \) and width \( W \).

1. **First Fold:**
   - When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.
   - This means the folded dimension is \( \frac{L}{2} \) and the other dimension remains \( W \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is \( 2(\frac{L}{2} + W) = 48 \).
   - Simplifying gives \( L + 2W = 48 \).

2. **Second Fold:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.
   - This means the folded dimension is \( \frac{W}{2} \) and the other dimension remains \( L \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is \( 2(L + \frac{W}{2}) = 66 \).
   - Simplifying gives \( 2L + W = 66 \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( L + 2W = 48 \)
2. \( 2L + W = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( L \) and \( W \).

From equation 1: \( L = 48 - 2W \).

Substitute \( L = 48 - 2W \) into equation 2:
\[ 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 4W + W = 66 \]
\[ 96 - 3W = 66 \]
\[ 3W = 30 \]
\[ W = 10 \]

Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into equation 1:
\[ L + 2(10) = 48 \]
\[ L + 20 = 48 \]
\[ L = 28 \]

Now, we have \( L = 28 \) and \( W = 10 \).

The area of the sheet is \( L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \).

It seems there is a mistake in the calculation or understanding of the problem, as the area calculated does not match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the folding and perimeter conditions.

Upon re-evaluation, the correct approach should be:

1. **First Fold:**
   - Perimeter of folded part: \( 2(\frac{L}{2} + W) = 48 \)
   - Simplifies to: \( L + 2W = 48 \)

2. **Second Fold:**
   - Perimeter of folded part: \( 2(L + \frac{W}{2}) = 66 \)
   - Simplifies to: \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Solving these equations:
- From \( L + 2W = 48 \), we have \( L = 48 - 2W \).
- Substitute into \( 2L + W = 66 \):
  \[ 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \]
  \[ 96 - 4W + W = 66 \]
  \[ 96 - 3W = 66 \]
  \[ 3W = 30 \]
  \[ W = 10 \]

- Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into \( L = 48 - 2W \):
  \[ L = 48 - 2(10) \]
  \[ L = 48 - 20 \]
  \[ L = 28 \]

The area of the sheet is \( L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \).

Upon further inspection, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement or choices, as the calculated area does not match any of the given options. The correct area based on the problem setup should be 280, but this is not listed. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem or choices provided.

E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. The shop assistant's monthly salary \( S \) is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We want to find the monthly sales \( x \) such that the monthly salary reaches $1500.

The equation for the monthly salary is:
\[ S = 500 + 0.05x \]

We want \( S = 1500 \), so we set up the equation:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05x \]

Subtract 500 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1000 = 0.05x \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.05:

A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Let's assume the side of the square is 'd' km. The total distance traveled by the plane is 4d km (since it flies along all four sides of the square).

Now, we calculate the time taken to travel each side:
- Time for the first side at 200 km/hr = d/200 hours
- Time for the second side at 400 km/hr = d/400 hours
- Time for the third side at 600 km/hr = d/600 hours
- Time for the fourth side at 800 km/hr = d/800 hours

The total time taken is:
Total time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800

To simplify, we find a common denominator, which is 2400:
Total time = (12d/2400) + (6d/2400) + (4d/2400) + (3d/2400)
Total time = (12d + 6d + 4d + 3d) / 2400
Total time = 25d / 2400

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 4d / (25d/2400)
Average speed = 4d * (2400/25d)
Average speed = 4 * 96
Average speed = 384 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr.

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \).
- Let the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ w + b = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ w(x + 1) + bx = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ wx + w + bx = 100 \]

Since \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute \( b = 18 - w \) into the equation:

\[ wx + w + (18 - w)x = 100 \]

\[ 18x + w = 100 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( w + b = 18 \)
2. \( 18x + w = 100 \)

From equation 2, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ w = 100 - 18x \]

Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) into equation 1:

\[ (100 - 18x) + b = 18 \]

\[ b = 18 - (100 - 18x) \]

\[ b = 18x - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( w \) and \( b \) that satisfy both equations. Since \( w \) and \( b \) must be non-negative integers, we solve for \( x \) such that both \( w \) and \( b \) are integers.

Let's test the options:

A) \( w = 10, b = 8 \)
B) \( w = 9, b = 8 \)
C) \( w = 7, b = 8 \)
D) \( w = 5, b = 6 \)
E) \( w = 11, b = 12 \)

For option A:

- \( w = 10 \), \( b = 8 \)
- \( w + b = 18 \) (satisfied)
- \( 18x + 10 = 100 \)
- \( 18x = 90 \)
- \( x = 5 \)

The cost of brown sharpeners is 5 rupees each, and the cost of white sharpeners is 6 rupees each. The total cost is:

2. **Hose A's contribution in the first 2 hours**: In 2 hours, Hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Remaining pool to be filled**: After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool remains to be filled.

4. **Combined rate of hoses A and B**: Together, they fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Hose B's rate**: Since Hose A's rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, and the combined rate is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour, Hose B's rate must be \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

The servant's income consists of a fixed salary and a commission. The fixed salary is 1500 Rupees per month. The commission is 15% of the monthly sales.

Let's denote the monthly sales as \( S \).

The commission earned from the sales is \( 0.15 \times S \).

The total monthly income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission:
\[ \text{Total Income} = 1500 + 0.15 \times S \]

We want this total income to be 6000 Rupees:
\[ 1500 + 0.15 \times S = 6000 \]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission term:
\[ 0.15 \times S = 6000 - 1500 \]
\[ 0.15 \times S = 4500 \]

E)12%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the borrowed amount. The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. 

First, calculate the total amount paid over the 12 months:
12 installments * Rs.31.50 = Rs.378

The interest paid is the total amount paid minus the principal amount:
Interest = Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18

Now, we need to find the interest rate. The interest rate is typically calculated on an annual basis, so we need to consider the interest paid over one year.

The formula for simple interest is:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

We rearrange this to solve for the rate:
Rate = Interest / (Principal * Time)

Here, the principal is Rs.360, the interest is Rs.18, and the time is 1 year (since the installments are monthly over a year).

Rate = Rs.18 / (Rs.360 * 1) = 0.05

However, the problem asks for the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces, not the total number of unpainted faces. Since the inner cubes are not painted at all, they contribute to the count of cubes with unpainted faces.

Thus, the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is the number of inner cubes, which is 27.

The correct answer is not directly listed in the choices, but if we consider the problem as asking for the total number of unpainted faces, the closest match would be:

E) 498

This choice seems to be a misinterpretation of the problem, as the correct interpretation should focus on the number of cubes with unpainted faces, which is 27.

E)44",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \).

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

We are given that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we need:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( k^2 = \frac{n + 4}{2} \), then:
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) is odd and between 10 and 99.

Let's test the choices:

A) \( n = 47 \)
\[ 47 + 4 = 51 \]
\[ \frac{51}{2} = 25.5 \] (not a perfect square)

\[ 67 + 4 = 71 \]
\[ \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \] (not a perfect square)

E) \( n = 44 \) (not an odd number, so not possible)

None of the choices directly satisfy the condition, but let's re-evaluate the logic. The correct approach is to find \( n \) such that \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) is a perfect square. 

Let's try \( n = 41 \) again:
\[ 41 + 4 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \] (not a perfect square)

Upon re-evaluation, it seems there was a mistake in the initial logic. Let's try a different approach:

If we assume \( n = 41 \), the sum of the numbers is:

\[ 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355 \]
\[ \frac{355}{10} = 35.5 \] (not a perfect square)

Upon further inspection, the correct choice should be \( n = 41 \) because the sum of the numbers \( 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 \) is 225, and \( \frac{225}{10} = 22.5 \) is not a perfect square, but the logic was flawed in the initial setup.

- 4/5 of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.10x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus the students not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

\[ 0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x \]

First, convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal, which is 0.80. Now, the equation becomes:

\[ 0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x \]

Combine the terms with \( x \):

\[ 0.98x + 20 = x \]

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:

\[ 20 = x - 0.98x \]

\[ 20 = 0.02x \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.02:

- Let Q's age be Q years.
- Let R's age be R years.
- Let T's age be T years.

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

1. R - Q = Q - T

This equation implies that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

2. R + T = 50

From equation 1, we can express R in terms of Q and T:

R = 2Q - T

Substitute this expression for R into equation 2:

(2Q - T) + T = 50

Simplify the equation:

2Q = 50

Q = 25

Now that we have Q's age, we can find R's age using the expression R = 2Q - T:

R = 2(25) - T
R = 50 - T

Since R + T = 50, we can substitute R = 50 - T into this equation:

(50 - T) + T = 50

This equation is always true, confirming our expressions are consistent.

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age:

R - Q = (50 - T) - 25

From the problem, we know:
1. Sachin's batting average before the finals is 51, so:
   \[

E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. If we use 'n' letters, we can represent 'n' types of books.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, the number of unique pairs that can be formed from 'n' letters is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.

We need to find the smallest 'n' such that the total number of codes (single letters + pairs of letters) is at least 10.

Let's try different values of 'n':

- **n = 3**:

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle first and then calculate the perimeter.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times b \]

Substituting the expression for the length, we have:
\[ b \times (4b + 1) = 150 \]

Expanding this equation gives:
\[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

The square root of 2401 is 49. So, the solutions for \( b \) are:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

   - Large cakes: 20 large cakes are needed. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. Therefore, to make 20 large cakes, we need 20 / 6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers for large cakes.

   - Small cakes: 700 small cakes are needed. Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes. Therefore, to make 700 small cakes, we need 700 / 105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, rounding up, we need 7 helpers for small cakes.

2. **Total helpers required:**
   - Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we need the maximum of the two helper requirements: max(4, 7) = 7 helpers.

However, we must ensure that the total number of helpers can handle both tasks within the given time. Since 7 helpers can handle the small cakes, and 4 helpers can handle the large cakes, we need to check if 7 helpers can be distributed to cover both tasks efficiently.

- If we assign 4 helpers to large cakes, they will complete the task in 3 hours.
- The remaining 3 helpers can make 3 * 105 = 315 small cakes in 3 hours, which is not enough for 700 small cakes.

Therefore, we need additional helpers to cover the shortfall in small cakes. Let's calculate again:

- Assign 4 helpers to large cakes (task completed in 3 hours).
- Assign 7 helpers to small cakes (7 * 105 = 735 small cakes in 3 hours, which is sufficient).

3. **Two baguettes = ? pita breads**: We need to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.

First, let's express the amount of falafel in one baguette in terms of pita breads:

A)13x/2
B)13x/2 - 6
C)13x/24
D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the fence in feet, given the width of each picket and the space between them.

1. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

For x pickets, there are (x - 1) spaces between them. Therefore, the total length in inches is:

- Total width of pickets: \( \frac{1}{2} \times x \)
- Total space between pickets: \( 6 \times (x - 1) \)

The total length in inches is:

\[ \text{Total length in inches} = \frac{1}{2}x + 6(x - 1) \]

Simplifying:

\[ = \frac{1}{2}x + 6x - 6 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{12}{2}x - 6 \]
\[ = \frac{13}{2}x - 6 \]

Now, convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{\frac{13}{2}x - 6}{12} \]

Simplifying:

\[ = \frac{13x - 12}{24} \]

C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote the speed of the ship as \( S \) miles per hour. The plane travels at \( 10S \) miles per hour. 

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet. 

In that time, the ship travels an additional distance of \( S \times t \) miles, and the plane travels \( 10S \times t \) miles.

At the meeting point, the total distance traveled by the ship is \( 180 + S \times t \), and the total distance traveled by the plane is \( 10S \times t \).

Since they meet at the same point, the total distance from the starting point is the same for both:

\[ 180 + S \times t = 10S \times t \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ 180 = 10S \times t - S \times t \]
\[ 180 = 9S \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9S} \]
\[ t = \frac{20}{S} \]

Now, substitute \( t \) back into the equation for the total distance from the starting point:

\[ \text{Distance} = 180 + S \times \frac{20}{S} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 180 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 200 \]

Therefore, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 200 miles.

We assume that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is:
\[
\frac{20}{500} = \frac{1}{25}

This means that 1 out of every 25 deer in the forest is tagged. Since 300 deer were tagged, we can set up the equation:
\[

The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so the train times are 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:10 AM. We need to find the probability that the first train he catches is the main line train.

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
A)20%
B)40%
C)50%
D)65%
E)75%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the population growth over the years.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population two years from now would be:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that this future population is exactly double the population of one year ago:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

This implies that the population one year ago was half of what it will be two years from now. Therefore, the population one year ago must have been:

\[ P = \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from one year ago to the current population. Let's denote the current population as \( P_{\text{current}} \).

Since the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, and it grows by 10% each year, the current population must be:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \]

To find the percent increase from one year ago to the current population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P_{\text{current}} - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the expression for \( P_{\text{current}} \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{P \times 1.1 - P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left(\frac{0.1P}{P}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = 10\% \]

1. We start with a square piece of cloth. Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \).

2. The square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. This means the dimensions of the rectangle are \( s \) (the original side length) and \( s - 4 \) (the trimmed side).

3. This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

The area of the rectangle is split equally between the two triangles, so the total area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

The area of the rectangle is also given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = s \times (s - 4) = 140 \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation:
\[ s^2 - 4s = 140 \]

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
\[ s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576 \]

The square root of 576 is 24, so:
\[ s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2} \]

This gives two solutions:
\[ s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \]
\[ s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10 \]

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve this problem, we need to express the numbers M and N in terms of their digits a, b, and c. 

M is a three-digit number, so it can be expressed as:
\[ M = 100a + 10b + c \]

N is the number formed by reversing the digits of M, so:
\[ N = 100c + 10b + a \]

We are given that M > N, which implies:
\[ 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a \]

Simplifying this inequality, we get:
\[ 99a > 99c \]
\[ a > c \]

We are also given the equation:
\[ M - N + 396c = 990 \]

Substituting the expressions for M and N, we have:
\[ (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 99a - 99c + 396c = 990 \]
\[ 99a + 297c = 990 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 99, we get:
\[ a + 3c = 10 \]

Since a and c are digits (0-9), and a > c, we can find the possible values for a and c:

- If c = 1, then a = 10 - 3(1) = 7
- If c = 2, then a = 10 - 3(2) = 4
- If c = 3, then a = 10 - 3(3) = 1

These are the only possibilities since a must be greater than c and both must be digits.

Now, we need to find how many values of M are more than 300. M is expressed as:
\[ M = 100a + 10b + c \]

For each pair (a, c), b can be any digit from 0 to 9. Let's calculate the number of values of M for each pair:

1. For (a, c) = (7, 1), M = 100(7) + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b. Since 701 is already greater than 300, all 10 values of b (0 through 9) are valid.

2. For (a, c) = (4, 2), M = 100(4) + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b. Since 402 is greater than 300, all 10 values of b (0 through 9) are valid.

3. For (a, c) = (1, 3), M = 100(1) + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b. To be greater than 300, 103 + 10b > 300, which implies 10b > 197, so b must be at least 20, which is not possible since b is a single digit. Therefore, no values of b are valid for this pair.

Adding the valid values for each case, we have 10 (for a = 7, c = 1) + 10 (for a = 4, c = 2) = 20 values of M that are more than 300.

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now, substitute \( V = 3 \) back into the first equation:
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500
\]
\[
= 1680
\]

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1680.

First, calculate the time for one full rotation for each ball:
- Ball A: 26 minutes for 2 rotations, so 1 rotation takes 26/2 = 13 minutes.
- Ball B: 35 minutes for 5 rotations, so 1 rotation takes 35/5 = 7 minutes.

Now, find the LCM of 13 and 7. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular weekday as \( x \).

- On weekdays (Monday to Saturday), the hotel buys \( x \) newspapers each day. Since there are 6 weekdays, the total cost for these days is \( 6 \times 1 \times x = 6x \).

- On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers, so it buys \( 2x \) newspapers. The cost for Sunday is \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \).

The total cost for the week is given as $210. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 6x + 8x = 210 \]

Simplifying the equation:

A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. 

Let the original number of friends be \( x \). Each friend was supposed to contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \). Each of these friends had to contribute \( \frac{96}{x-4} \).

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x-4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

To solve this equation, first clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x-4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)
\]

Simplify and expand:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

Now, factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives:

\[
x - 12 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 8 = 0
\]

Solving these gives:

\[
x = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

Perimeter of rectangle = 2 * (length + breadth) = 2 * (27 cm + 17 cm) = 2 * 44 cm = 88 cm.

Now, this wire is rebent to form a square. The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the length of one side. Let the side of the square be 's'. Therefore, we have:

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- Total amount received by 2 nephews = \( 2x \).
- Total amount received by 4 daughters = \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- Total amount received by 5 sons = \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:

A)18

Let's denote the number of members as \( n \).

The ages of the members can be expressed as:
- First term (youngest member's age): \( a = 7 \)
- Common difference: \( d = 0.25 \)

The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d) \]

Given that the sum of the ages is 250, we have:
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times 0.25) \]

Simplifying:
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + 0.25n - 0.25) \]
\[ 250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (13.75 + 0.25n) \]
\[ 500 = n \times (13.75 + 0.25n) \]
\[ 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2 \]

Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation:
\[ 0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0 \]

To simplify, multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal:
\[ n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0 \]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 55 \), and \( c = -2000 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025 \]

The square root of 11025 is 105.

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{-55 \pm 105}{2} \]

This gives two solutions:
\[ n = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
\[ n = \frac{-160}{2} = -80 \] (not possible since \( n \) must be positive)

A)5%
B)15%
C)25%
D)35%
E)45%",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Let's break down the information given:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

First, calculate the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither, 80% take at least one type of vacation.

Next, we know that 75% take a winter vacation. Out of these, 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75% - 40% = 35%.

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one vacation and 35% take only a winter vacation, the remaining percentage must be those who take only a summer vacation.

So, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is 80% - 75% = 5%.

In this problem:
- \(\text{Base}_1 = 10\) m (top width)
- \(\text{Base}_2 = 6\) m (bottom width)
- \(\text{Area} = 640\) square meters

We need to find the height, which is the depth of the canal.

Plugging the values into the formula:

\[ 640 = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 6) \times \text{Height} \]

\[ 640 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times \text{Height} \]

A)70
B)30
C)3
D)7
E)5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matches played by the tennis team. We know that the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.

Let's denote the total number of matches played as \( x \).

The number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches, which can be expressed as \( 0.3x \).

We also know that the number of matches won is 20, so the total number of matches can be expressed as the sum of matches won and matches lost:

\[ x = 20 + 0.3x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.3x = 20 \]
\[ 0.7x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{0.7} \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{7} \]
\[ x \approx 28.57 \]

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round \( x \) to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[ n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[ n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)(n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4) \]

This is because:

\[ (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)(n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4) = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) simplifies to:

\[ x = n - 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the range of \( x \) for \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \).

1. For \( n = 36 \):

\[ x = 36 - 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 24 + 4 = 16 \]

2. For \( n = 72 \):

\[ x = 72 - 4\sqrt{72} + 4 \]

B)4 months
C)23 months
D)24 months
E)84 months",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time C joined the business in relation to B's joining, based on the profit-sharing ratio.

1. **Calculate the profit-sharing ratio:**
   - A's investment: Rs.40,000 for 12 months = 40,000 * 12 = 480,000
   - B's investment: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) months = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000
   - Let C join x months after B, so C's investment: Rs.120,000 for (12 - 2 - x) months = 120,000 * (10 - x)

2. **Total profit and C's share:**
   - Total profit = Rs.375,000
   - C's share = Rs.150,000

3. **Set up the equation for C's share:**
   - C's share of the profit is proportional to his investment time product: 
     \[
     \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{150,000}{375,000}

\[ 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \]

\[ 99a - 99c = 495 \]

\[ a - c = 5 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)

2. \( a = c + 5 \)

We also have the condition for the sum of squares:

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[ c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), \( c = 30 \):

\[ c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{(-19)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 30}}{6} \]

\[ c = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{361 - 360}}{6} \]

\[ c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6} \]

This gives us two possible values for \( c \):

\[ c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \] (not an integer, discard)

\[ c = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \]

So, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back to find \( a \) and \( b \):

E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information:

1. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000.
2. The sum of the two numbers is 1000.

Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x > y \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
2. \( x + y = 1000 \)

The first equation can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula:

\[ (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 \]

We know from the second equation that \( x + y = 1000 \). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[ 1000(x - y) = 256000 \]

Solving for \( x - y \):

\[ x - y = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( x + y = 1000 \)
2. \( x - y = 256 \)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:

\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \]
\[ 2x = 1256 \]
\[ x = 628 \]

A)2
B)3
C)4
D)5
E)6",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of median and how it relates to the number of family members.

The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. Given that the median income is $3000, this means that when the incomes are listed in order, $3000 is the middle value.

If there are an odd number of family members, the median is the income of the middle person. If there are an even number of family members, the median is the average of the two middle incomes.

Let's analyze the choices:

- If there are 2 members, the median would be the average of the two incomes, which cannot be $3000 unless both earn $3000, but then the total would be $6000, not $9000.
- If there are 3 members, the median is the income of the second person. For the median to be $3000, one person must earn less than $3000, one exactly $3000, and one more than $3000. However, this setup cannot sum to $9000.
- If there are 4 members, the median is the average of the second and third incomes. For the median to be $3000, the second and third incomes must average to $3000. This setup can work if, for example, two members earn $3000 each, and the other two earn $1500 each, totaling $9000.
- If there are 5 members, the median is the income of the third person. For the median to be $3000, the third person must earn $3000. However, this setup cannot sum to $9000 without specific constraints on the other incomes.
- If there are 6 members, the median is the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the third and fourth incomes must average to $3000. This setup can work, but it requires more specific constraints on the other incomes to sum to $9000.

The most straightforward solution is with 4 members, where the median is the average of the second and third incomes, both being $3000, and the total can easily sum to $9000 with reasonable income distribution.

If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh:
\[ n \times (x + 60) = 624000 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( nx = 600000 \)
2. \( n(x + 60) = 624000 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( n \):
\[ x = \frac{600000}{n} \]

Substitute this expression for \( x \) into the second equation:
\[ n\left(\frac{600000}{n} + 60\right) = 624000 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 600000 + 60n = 624000 \]

Subtract 600000 from both sides:
\[ 60n = 24000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes the winning candidate received. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. This means he received 15% more than half of the total votes.

First, calculate half of the total votes:
Half of 4,000 = 2,000 votes.

Now, calculate 15% of the total votes:
15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600 votes.

Add this to the half of the total votes to find the total votes the winning candidate received:

The total earnings from copper coins is \( 0.20c \) dollars, and from brass coins is \( 0.25b \) dollars. The total earnings equation is:

\[ 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40 \]

To eliminate decimals, multiply the entire equation by 100:

\[ 20c + 25b = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum \( c \) such that both \( c \) and \( b \) are non-negative integers. 

Rearrange the equation to express \( b \) in terms of \( c \):

\[ 25b = 340 - 20c \]

\[ b = \frac{340 - 20c}{25} \]

For \( b \) to be an integer, \( 340 - 20c \) must be divisible by 25. 

Let's check the values of \( c \) starting from the smallest:

   - 80% of 600 is calculated as: \( 0.8 \times 600 = 480 \) golf balls sold.

2. **Understand the distribution of sold golf balls:**
   - The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

   - Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold (and initially in stock) is: \( \frac{480}{2} = 240 \).

3. **Determine the initial number of yellow golf balls:**
   - Since the store sold 240 yellow golf balls and still had some yellow golf balls left (because it only sold all of its white golf balls), the initial number of yellow golf balls must be more than 240.
   - The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600, and 240 of these were white.

   So, CP = Rs. 450.

2. **Calculate the Selling Price (SP):**

A)1 hr 23 min
B)1 hr 15 min
C)1 hr 8 min
D)56 min
E)55 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when the two trains will meet each other. 

1. **Train M's Journey:**
   - Leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time = 4 hours.

2. **Train N's Journey:**
   - Leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time = 3.5 hours.

Assuming the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains, we can calculate the speeds of the trains:

- Let the distance between City A and City B be D.
- Speed of Train M = D/4 (since it takes 4 hours to cover the distance D).
- Speed of Train N = D/3.5 (since it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance D).

Now, we need to find the time after 7 am when the two trains meet. By 7 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours (from 5 am to 7 am), covering half the distance (D/2).

From 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds:

- Relative speed = (D/4) + (D/3.5).

To find the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am, we set up the equation:

- Distance covered by both trains together = D/2 (since Train M has already covered D/2 by 7 am).
- Time = Distance / Relative Speed = (D/2) / [(D/4) + (D/3.5)].

Simplifying the relative speed:

- (D/4) + (D/3.5) = (7D/28) + (4D/14) = (7D/28) + (8D/28) = (15D/28).

So, the time it takes for them to meet after 7 am is:

- Time = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/15D) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours.

Converting 14/15 hours into minutes:

- 14/15 hours = (14/15) * 60 minutes = 56 minutes.

Therefore, the two trains will meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

A)1 minute
B)2 minutes
C)3 minutes
D)4 minutes
E)5 minutes",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Janice and Jennie together to bike a total of 1 mile.

Janice's speed is 10 miles per hour, which means she bikes 1/10 of a mile in 1 minute (since 10 miles per hour is equivalent to 1 mile every 6 minutes, or 1/10 of a mile per minute).

Jennie's speed is 20 miles per hour, which means she bikes 1/20 of a mile in 1 minute (since 20 miles per hour is equivalent to 1 mile every 3 minutes, or 1/20 of a mile per minute).

Together, in 1 minute, they bike:
1/10 + 1/20 = 2/20 + 1/20 = 3/20 of a mile.

To find out how long it takes them to bike 1 mile together, we set up the equation:
(3/20) * t = 1 mile

Solving for t gives:
t = 20/3 minutes

20/3 minutes is approximately 6.67 minutes. However, we need to find the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile, not the time it takes for each to bike 1 mile individually.

Since they collectively bike 3/20 of a mile in 1 minute, we need to find how many minutes it takes to reach 1 mile. 

1 mile / (3/20 miles per minute) = 20/3 minutes = 6.67 minutes.

However, the problem asks for the time until they have collectively biked 1 mile, which is a bit of a trick question because they are biking together, and the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile is not directly one of the choices. 

The closest interpretation is that they are biking together, and the time it takes for them to collectively reach 1 mile is the time it takes for their combined rate to reach 1 mile, which is 20/3 minutes or approximately 6.67 minutes.

For the first ant:
- Height = 4 inches

For the second ant:
- Height = 6 inches
- Shadow = x inches (what we need to find)

The proportion based on similar triangles is:

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. This means if the height is 2x, the semi-perimeter is 5x.

2. **Cost of Papering**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 meters) and costs Rs. 2 per meter. Therefore, the total length of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters.

3. **Area of Walls**: The area of the walls that needs to be papered is the total area minus the area for doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m. Let the total area of the walls be A. Then, A - 15 = 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m, so A = 80 sq.m.

4. **Relating Area to Dimensions**: The area of the walls is the perimeter of the room times the height. If the perimeter is 2 * semi-perimeter = 10x, then the area is 10x * 2x = 20x^2.

5. **Equating Areas**: We have 20x^2 = 80, so x^2 = 4, and x = 2.

Given the equation \(x^2 + mx + 22 = 0\), we know one of the roots is 1.5. Let's denote the other root as \(r\).

According to Vieta's formulas:
1. The sum of the roots is \(-m\), so \(1.5 + r = -m\).
2. The product of the roots is 22, so \(1.5 \times r = 22\).

From the product equation, we can solve for \(r\):
\[ r = \frac{22}{1.5} = \frac{220}{15} = \frac{44}{3}. \]

Now, substitute \(r = \frac{44}{3}\) into the sum equation:

Let's assume the cost of the ice cream cake is C.

- Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so her rate of earning is C/5 per hour.
- Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so her rate of earning is C/4 per hour.

When they work together, their combined rate of earning is:

(C/5) + (C/4) = (4C/20) + (5C/20) = 9C/20 per hour.

To find out how many hours they need to work together to earn C (the cost of the cake), we set up the equation:

(9C/20) * t = C

Solving for t, we get:

t = C / (9C/20) = 20/9 hours.

A)x > y
B)y^2 > x^2
C)-x^3 < y^2
D)–x < y
E)x < –y",B,"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and the inequality |x^3| > |y^2|.

1. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( x < 0 \): x is negative.
   - \( y > 0 \): y is positive.

2. **Inequality Analysis:**
   - \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) implies that the absolute value of \( x^3 \) is greater than the absolute value of \( y^2 \).
   - Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^3 \) is also negative, and thus \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).
   - Since \( y > 0 \), \( y^2 \) is positive, and thus \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

   Therefore, the inequality becomes:
   \[
   -x^3 > y^2
   \]

3. **Evaluating the Choices:**

   - **A) \( x > y \):** This cannot be true because \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), so \( x \) is always less than \( y \).

   - **B) \( y^2 > x^2 \):** This is not necessarily true. We know \( -x^3 > y^2 \), but this does not directly imply \( y^2 > x^2 \).

   - **C) \(-x^3 < y^2\):** This is incorrect because we have established that \(-x^3 > y^2\).

   - **D) \(-x < y\):** This is not necessarily true. The inequality \(-x^3 > y^2\) does not directly imply \(-x < y\).

   - **E) \( x < -y \):** This is the correct choice. Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( -y \) is negative. Given that \(-x^3 > y^2\), it suggests that \( x \) is more negative than \(-y\), hence \( x < -y \).

Next, we find out how long it takes for the ants to meet. Since the distance between the farms is 75 cm, and they are closing this distance at a rate of 15 cm per hour, the time it takes for them to meet is:

75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours.

First, calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be bought with Rs 810:
- The cost of one trouser is Rs 70.
- Maximum number of trousers = Total money / Cost per trouser = 810 / 70 = 11.57

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum whole number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.

Now, calculate the remaining money after buying 11 trousers:
- Cost of 11 trousers = 11 * 70 = Rs 770
- Remaining money = 810 - 770 = Rs 40

With Rs 40 remaining, we can buy shirts:
- The cost of one shirt is Rs 30.
- Maximum number of shirts = Remaining money / Cost per shirt = 40 / 30 = 1.33

Again, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a shirt, the maximum whole number of shirts that can be purchased is 1.

1. Let the original total cover price for 15 issues be \( x \).
2. The subscription cost is $42.00, which is 25% less than the original cover price.
3. Therefore, the subscription cost represents 75% of the original cover price.

We can set up the equation:

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{42}{0.75} \]
\[ x = 56 \]

The original total cover price for 15 issues is $56.00.

Now, to find the cover price per issue, divide the total cover price by the number of issues:

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin landed on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin landed on tails.

We know that:
1. \( H + T = 20 \) (since the coin was flipped 20 times).
2. The total amount of money exchanged is zero, meaning Christopher's payments to Jonathan equal Jonathan's payments to Christopher.

Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan for each head, so he gives \( 2H \) dollars in total.
Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher for each tail, so he gives \( 3T \) dollars in total.

For neither to win or lose any money, the total money exchanged must be equal:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

From the second equation, we can express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute \( T \) in the first equation:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:

2. Allen and Bob start at the same time, with Allen traveling at 54 kmph and Bob at 78 kmph.

3. When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances they have traveled is D km. Let t1 be the time taken to meet for the first time. So, we have:

B)22 min
C)23 min
D)21 min
E)20 min",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined work rate of A and B working together and then calculate the time it takes for them to complete the wall together.

1. **Calculate individual work rates:**
   - A's work rate is 1 wall per 40 minutes, or \( \frac{1}{40} \) walls per minute.
   - B's work rate is 1 wall per 45 minutes, or \( \frac{1}{45} \) walls per minute.

2. **Calculate combined work rate:**
   - Combined work rate = A's work rate + B's work rate
   - Combined work rate = \( \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45} \)

3. **Find a common denominator and add the fractions:**
   - The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360.
   - Convert each rate to have a denominator of 360:
     - A's rate: \( \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360} \)
     - B's rate: \( \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360} \)
   - Combined rate: \( \frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360} \)

4. **Calculate the time to complete 1 wall:**
   - If they complete \( \frac{17}{360} \) of a wall per minute, then the time to complete 1 wall is the reciprocal: \( \frac{360}{17} \) minutes.

5. **Convert the time to minutes:**
   - \( \frac{360}{17} \approx 21.18 \) minutes

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
A)43 seconds
B)39 seconds
C)20 seconds
D)33 seconds
E)55 seconds",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.

First, we know the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. This means the front of the train travels 1 mile in 3 seconds. Since the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the length of the train:

1. Convert the train's speed to miles per second:
   \[
   120 \text{ miles per hour} = \frac{120}{3600} \text{ miles per second} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second}

2. Calculate the length of the train:
   \[
   \text{Length of the train} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time to enter} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per second} \times 3 \text{ seconds} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, to find out how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel, we need to consider the time it takes for the back of the train to exit the tunnel. The total distance the train needs to cover is the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 1 \text{ mile} + \frac{1}{10} \text{ mile} = \frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}
\]

3. Calculate the total time to pass through the tunnel:

E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the terms of the invoice and calculate the effective interest rate for taking the discount.

The terms ""4/30, n/100"" mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 100 days.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - 4% of $20,000 = $800

2. Calculate the amount to be paid if the discount is taken:
   - $20,000 - $800 = $19,200

3. Calculate the effective interest rate for borrowing the money to take the discount:
   - The merchant saves $800 by paying $19,200 instead of $20,000.
   - The time period for the discount is 70 days (100 days - 30 days).

4. Calculate the simple interest rate:
   - The interest saved is $800 for 70 days.
   - To find the annual interest rate, we use the formula for simple interest: 
     \[
     \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Interest Saved}}{\text{Principal} \times \text{Time}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Here, Principal = $19,200, Interest Saved = $800, Time = 70/365 years.
   - \[
     \text{Interest Rate} = \left(\frac{800}{19,200 \times \frac{70}{365}}\right) \times 100

We are told that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of parts in the mixture:

Let the total number of parts be \( x \). Then, the rice part is \(\frac{2}{x}\) of the total mixture. We know this corresponds to 3 pounds of rice:

\[
\frac{2}{x} \times \text{Total weight} = 3

Let \( s \) be the cost of one soda in cents, and \( e \) be the cost of one energy bar in cents.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( s + 2e = 150 \)
2. \( 2s + 3e = 300 \)

We need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, which is \( 6s + 7e \).

First, let's solve the system of equations. We can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):

\[
2(s + 2e) = 2 \times 150 \implies 2s + 4e = 300
\]

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:

\[
(2s + 4e) - (2s + 3e) = 300 - 300
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
e = 0
\]

Substitute \( e = 0 \) back into the first equation:

\[
s + 2(0) = 150 \implies s = 150

Now, we know \( s = 150 \) and \( e = 0 \).

Calculate \( 6s + 7e \):

\[
6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900

B)Rs. 7.2
C)Rs. 5.6
D)Rs. 8
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the manufacturing cost per pen, given the conditions of the problem.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 7200 pens:**
   - The company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
   - Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000.

2. **Determine the total number of pens manufactured:**
   - 10% of the pens are defective, so 90% of the pens are non-defective and sold.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured.
   - 90% of \( x \) = 7200 pens (since these are the non-defective pens delivered).
   - \( 0.9x = 7200 \)
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 \).

3. **Calculate the total manufacturing cost:**
   - The company estimates a 25% profit on all manufactured pens.
   - Let \( C \) be the manufacturing cost per pen.
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 8000 \times C \).
   - Profit = 25% of the total manufacturing cost.

1. **L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]**: 
   - [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
   - [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y.
   - [x + y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y.

   - [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x.
   - [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.

To find when L(x, y) = R(x, y), we need to consider the fractional parts of x and y. Let x = a + f_x and y = b + f_y, where a and b are integers, and 0 ≤ f_x, f_y < 1.

- L(x, y) = a + b + [a + b + f_x + f_y]
- R(x, y) = [2a + 2f_x] + [2b + 2f_y]

For L(x, y) = R(x, y), we need:

In this case, L(x, y) = a + b + (a + b) = 2a + 2b
R(x, y) = 2a + [2f_x] + 2b + [2f_y]

For L(x, y) = R(x, y), we need [2f_x] + [2f_y] = 0, which implies f_x, f_y < 0.5.

Now consider the case where f_x + f_y ≥ 1:
- [a + b + f_x + f_y] = a + b + 1
- L(x, y) = a + b + (a + b + 1) = 2a + 2b + 1

In this case, R(x, y) = 2a + [2f_x] + 2b + [2f_y]

B)12%
C)6%
D)8%
E)4%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI).

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
where \( P \) is the principal amount, \( R \) is the rate of interest, and \( T \) is the time in years.

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

Given:
- Principal \( P = 5000 \)
- Time \( T = 2 \) years
- Difference between CI and SI = Rs. 72

We need to find the rate of interest \( R \).

The difference between CI and SI for 2 years is given by:
\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{P \times R^2}{100^2} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 72 = \frac{5000 \times R^2}{100^2} \]

Simplifying:
\[ 72 = \frac{5000 \times R^2}{10000} \]
\[ 72 = \frac{R^2}{2} \]
\[ R^2 = 144 \]
\[ R = \sqrt{144} \]
\[ R = 12 \]

A)50
B)70
C)75
D)100
E)125",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given and set up equations based on the conditions.

Let's define:
- \( V \) as the number of files infected by a virus.
- \( W \) as the number of files infected by a worm.
- \( B \) as the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( V + W - B = 250 \) (since files infected by both are counted twice in \( V + W \)).
2. \( W - B = 2.5B \) (files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times those infected by both).
3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so 50% were infected by a virus: \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).

Now, let's solve these equations:
- From equation 2: \( W - B = 2.5B \) implies \( W = 3.5B \).
- Substitute \( V = 125 \) and \( W = 3.5B \) into equation 1:
  \[
  125 + 3.5B - B = 250
  \]
  \[
  125 + 2.5B = 250
  \]
  \[
  2.5B = 125

  \[
  B = 50
  \]

Now, substitute \( B = 50 \) back to find \( W \):
- \( W = 3.5 \times 50 = 175 \).

Finally, we need to find the number of files not infected by a worm:
- Total files = 250
- Files infected by a worm = \( W = 175 \)
- Files not infected by a worm = \( 250 - 175 = 75 \).

Therefore, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is 75.

A)36 grams
B)40 grams
C)42 grams
D)48 grams
E)50 grams",B,"To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the materials and their densities.

1. **Volume of the original coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm.
   - The radius is 15/2 = 7.5 mm.
   - Volume of the original coin = π * (7.5 mm)^2 * 2 mm = 225π mm³.

2. **Volume of aluminum and silver:**
   - The volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - Therefore, the volume of aluminum = volume of silver = 225π/2 mm³.

3. **Density relationship:**
   - Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, meaning the density of silver (ρ_silver) is twice the density of aluminum (ρ_aluminum).
   - Let ρ_aluminum = x, then ρ_silver = 2x.

4. **Weight of the original coin:**
   - The weight of the original coin is 30 grams.
   - Weight = Volume * Density.
   - Total weight = (Volume of aluminum * ρ_aluminum) + (Volume of silver * ρ_silver).
   - 30 grams = (225π/2 * x) + (225π/2 * 2x).

E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, n, such that there are 45 ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls, which is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

Since the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected, we are effectively choosing 2 balls from the remaining \(n-1\) balls. Therefore, the number of ways to select 2 balls from \(n-1\) balls is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}

We are given that this number is 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90

Expanding the left side:

Rearranging the equation:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0

\[

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -88\):

\[

A)I only
B)III only
C)II only
D)I and II only

Reasoning:
To determine the number of factors of a positive integer Q, we consider its prime factorization. If Q = p^a * q^b * ... * r^c, where p, q, ..., r are distinct prime numbers, then the number of factors of Q is given by (a+1)(b+1)...(c+1).

For Q to have exactly 5 factors, the product (a+1)(b+1)...(c+1) must equal 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if one of the exponents, say a, is 4 (since 4+1=5) and all other exponents are 0. This means Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number.

Let's evaluate each statement:
I. Q is the square of a prime number. 
   - If Q = p^2, then the number of factors is (2+1) = 3, which is not 5. So, this is incorrect.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
   - If Q = p^4, then the number of factors is (4+1) = 5. This is correct.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
   - If Q = p*q, where p and q are distinct primes, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is not 5. So, this is incorrect.

Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is 1 yacht per 12 hours, so Jill's rate is 5% of that, which is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 yachts per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht. Since Jill's rate is 1/240 yachts per hour, and she needs to clean 1/3 of a yacht, we set up the equation:

1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3.

Using Euler's Totient Function:
φ(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5)
          = 1,000 * (1/2) * (4/5)
          = 1,000 * 2/5
          = 400.

So, there are 400 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000 is:
Probability = φ(1,000) / 1,000 = 400 / 1,000 = 2/5.

240,,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
A)$45,000
B)$50,000
C)$54,000
D)$59,000
E)$62,000",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original principal amount that Charles invested, given that the total amount received at the end of the year is $54,080, with an annual interest rate of 8% compounded semi-annually.

The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- \( A = 54,080 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \) (8% as a decimal)
- \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually)
- \( t = 1 \) year

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2} \]

\[ 54,080 = P (1.04)^2 \]

\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

To find \( P \), divide both sides by 1.0816:

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

\[ P \approx 50,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is approximately $50,000.

- Let \( J \) be Joe's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Joe's sister's current age.
- Let \( F \) be Joe's father's current age.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( J + S + F = 100 \) (The sum of their ages is 100)

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This means the difference in age between Joe and his father is the same as the difference in age between Joe's sister's future age and her current age. So, \( F - J = 2S - S = S \).

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means the difference in age between Joe's father and Joe is the same as the difference in age between Joe's father and his sister's age when she was as old as her father. So, \( F - J = 2(F - S) \).

Let's solve these equations:

From equation 2, we have:
\[ F - J = S \]
\[ F = J + S \]

Substitute \( F = J + S \) into equation 1:
\[ J + S + (J + S) = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 2S = 100 \]
\[ J + S = 50 \]

Now, substitute \( J + S = 50 \) into \( F = J + S \):
\[ F = 50 \]

Thus, Joe's father's age is 50.

Substitute the expression for x:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m}{\frac{4my}{100}}\right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{m \times 100}{4my}\right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{100}{4y}\right) \times 100 \]

To find \( n \), we can estimate by taking the cube root of 2184, since \( n^3 \approx 2184 \). The cube root of 2184 is approximately 13, so we can try \( n = 13 \).

Calculate the product for \( n = 13 \):
