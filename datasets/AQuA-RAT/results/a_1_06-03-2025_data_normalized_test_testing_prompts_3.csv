0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the following:

- \( h \) is the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) is the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) is the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.
- \( v \) is the speed of the car.

From the problem, we know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Using the tangent of the angles, we have:
1. \( \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \) which implies \( x_1 = h \).
2. \( \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \) which implies \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. Therefore, the distance covered in 10 minutes is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right). \]

The speed of the car \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}. \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (i.e., when the distance is 0).

The remaining distance to the base is \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Using the speed \( v \), the time \( t \) is:
\[ t = \frac{\text{remaining distance}}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}. \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}. \]

Rationalizing the denominator:
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}. \]

The denominator simplifies to:
\[ (\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 3 - 1 = 2. \]

Thus, we have:
\[ t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5 \cdot \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 5(\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3}) = 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 5\sqrt{3} + 5. \]

Therefore, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   First, eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]

   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]

   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8
   \]

   Divide by 0.56:
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} = 78.2142857

1. **Find the prime factorization of each number:**
   - 9 = 3^2
   - 12 = 2^2 * 3

2. **Determine the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.
   - LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36

C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the complementary probabilities and the potential overlap between the events.

1. The probability that Stock A will not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).
2. The probability that Stock B will not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

The greatest probability that neither event occurs is when the events are independent. In this case, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[
P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = P(\text{A does not increase}) \times P(\text{B does not increase}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
\]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies considering the scenario where the events are mutually exclusive, which is not possible here since both stocks can independently increase or not increase. Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is when they are independent, as calculated above.

Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is:

D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}

Given that the profit is 20%, we can express the selling price in terms of the cost price:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}
\]

We know the selling price is Rs.360, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
\]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20}

Calculating the right side:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. Initially, all marbles in the bag are white. We paint 20 marbles black and put them back in the bag. So, there are 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. When we pull out 20 marbles the second time, 1 of them is black. The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out represents their percentage in the bag.

3. The percentage of black marbles in the second draw is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%

6. Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2000}{Q} = 5

   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 letters is \(26 \times 26 = 676\).

2. **Numbers**:
   - There are 10 digits (0 through 9).

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}

2. **Calculate the distance covered before the speed change:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before the speed changes:
     \[
     \text{Distance before speed change} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}

- \( P \) as the number of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the number of students who participated in the debating session.
- \( N \) as the number of students who neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session.

According to the problem:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \( P \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \).
- At least 35% of the students participated in the debating session, so \( D \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70 \).

We want to maximize \( N \), the number of students who did neither activity. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:
\[ P + D - (P \cap D) \leq 200 \]

To maximize \( N \), we need to minimize \( P + D \). The minimum value of \( P + D \) occurs when the overlap \( P \cap D \) is maximized. The maximum overlap occurs when all students who attended the debating session also attended the prom night, i.e., \( P \cap D = D \).

Thus, the minimum value of \( P + D \) is:
\[ P + D = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of students who did neither activity is:

D)260
E)280",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400.

First, let's calculate the total production cost for the year. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces:

\[ 420 \text{ units/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 5040 \text{ units/year} \]

The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost for the year is:

\[ 5040 \text{ units} \times 110 \text{ dollars/unit} = 554,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The profit is the revenue minus the production costs, so:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Production Cost} \]

We want the profit to be at least $626,400, so:

\[ \text{Revenue} - 554,400 \geq 626,400 \]

Solving for the revenue:

\[ \text{Revenue} \geq 626,400 + 554,400 \]
\[ \text{Revenue} \geq 1,080,800 \]

Now, we need to find the minimum selling price per component that results in this revenue. Let \( p \) be the selling price per component. The total revenue from selling 5040 units is:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 5040 \times p \]

We set this equal to the required revenue:

\[ 5040 \times p \geq 1,080,800 \]

Solving for \( p \):

\[ p \geq \frac{1,080,800}{5040} \]
\[ p \geq 214.4444 \]

Since the selling price must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $215. However, we need to choose from the given options, and the smallest option greater than or equal to $215 is $226.

E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yo-yos each machine produces per minute and then calculate the total time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos together.

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate of production is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ yo-yo}}{6 \text{ minutes}} \]

Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate of production is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ yo-yo}}{9 \text{ minutes}} \]

To find the combined rate of production, we add the rates of both machines:
\[ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 18, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18} \]
\[ \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18} \]

Adding these gives:
\[ \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \]

This means together, the machines produce \(\frac{5}{18}\) yo-yos per minute.

To find out how many minutes it takes to produce 10 yo-yos, we set up the equation:

Solving for minutes:
\[ \text{minutes} = \frac{10 \times 18}{5} \]

16,,"Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( v \) be the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- Let \( n \) be the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. Walking 20 steps and stopping:
   - You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps.
   - The time taken is 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, the elevator covers \( n - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes, so the speed of the elevator is:
     \[
     v = \frac{n - 20}{10}
     \]

2. Walking 10 steps and stopping:
   - You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( n - 10 \) steps.
   - The time taken is 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the elevator covers \( n - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes, so the speed of the elevator is:
     \[
     v = \frac{n - 10}{20}
     \]

Since both expressions represent the speed of the elevator, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{n - 20}{10} = \frac{n - 10}{20}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( n \):
\[
20(n - 20) = 10(n - 10)
\]

Expand both sides:
\[
20n - 400 = 10n - 100
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( n \):
\[
20n - 10n = 400 - 100
\]
\[
10n = 300
\]
\[
n = 30
\]

Now that we have \( n = 30 \), substitute back to find \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{n - 20}{10} = \frac{30 - 20}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \text{ step/minute}
\]

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

The correct answer is:

E)None of the above",D,"To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over the 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total number sold last year is:
     \[
     42 \text{ ovens/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 504 \text{ ovens}

1. The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x

A)12
B)16
C)24

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

First, let's understand what a 25% profit on the selling price means. If the selling price of each bag is $100, then the profit per bag is 25% of $100.

Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25

This means the grocer makes a $25 profit for each bag sold.

Now, we know the total profit made is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags sold = 120

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

However, it seems there is a mistake in the problem or the choices provided, as 120 is not one of the options. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure there are no misunderstandings.

The problem states the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which we calculated correctly as $25 per bag. The total profit of $3,000 divided by $25 per bag indeed results in 120 bags.

B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( y \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The total hours worked by Alex is \( 7x \) (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The total hours worked by Jacob is \( 9y \) (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both of them worked for almost the same number of hours, so we set up the equation:
\[ 7x \approx 9y \]

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into the equation \( 7x \approx 9y \):
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( y \) must be an integer (as it represents the number of toys), we round \( y \) to the nearest integer. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea concentration is 50%.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea in the solution is reduced by 15% of 50% = 0.15 * 50% = 7.5%.
   - New concentration of tea = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**

Let \( N \) be the total number of students. According to the problem:

- \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the students study math, so \( N \) must be divisible by 16.
- \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students study bio, so \( N \) must be divisible by 10.
- \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the students study English, so \( N \) must be divisible by 8.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 will give us the smallest number that \( N \) must be divisible by. 

Calculating the LCM:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime number appearing in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 80.

Now, we need to find the range of 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. Dividing 1000 by 80 gives:

\[ 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \]

The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13. Therefore, the smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

\[ 80 \times 13 = 1040 \]

The largest 4-digit number is 9999. Dividing 9999 by 80 gives:

\[ 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \]

The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124. Therefore, the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is:

\[ 80 \times 124 = 9920 \]

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

Let's denote the cost price of the appliance as \( C \).

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price \( S \) is given by:
\[ S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

We are also told that this selling price represents a gross profit of $20.00. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
\[ S - C = 20 \]

Substituting the expression for \( S \) from above:

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.4C = 20 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), divide both sides by 0.4:

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions \(3\), \(4\), and \(15\), the diagonal \(d\) is:

   - New position: (0, -3).

3. A travels 5 km east:
   - East movement increases the x-coordinate.

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's assume the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Combine the terms with \( b \):

\[ (x + y)b + x = 100 \]

Since \( x + y = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

We also know that \( x + y = 18 \), so:

\[ y = 18 - x \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into the equation for \( y \):

\[ y = 18 - (100 - 18b) \]

\[ y = 18 - 100 + 18b \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we have two expressions for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. \( x = 100 - 18b \)
2. \( y = 18b - 82 \)

Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find integer values of \( b \) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative.

Let's test the integer values of \( b \):

1. If \( b = 5 \):
   - \( x = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 100 - 90 = 10 \)
   - \( y = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8 \)

This gives us \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 8 \), which satisfies the condition \( x + y = 18 \).

   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

\[ 0.875x = 3500 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3500}{0.875} \]

\[ x = 4000 \]

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

The correct choice is:

C) Rs. 4000",True,,,

A)4
B)5
C)7
D)6
E)8",B,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys in one box:
- One dozen equals 12, so five dozen toys equal \(5 \times 12 = 60\) toys per box.

Next, calculate the total number of toys in one tempo:
- Each tempo contains 98 boxes, so the total number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60 = 5880\) toys.

Now, we need to find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys:
- Divide the total number of toys (29,400) by the number of toys per tempo (5,880):

\[
\frac{29400}{5880} = 5
\]

Therefore, 5 tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges. This is a combination problem, where order does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the \( 8! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \times 8!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work is done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black before Mr. Blue starts working, and then calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to finish the remaining work.

1. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Brown works for 8 days, so he completes \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black:**
   - Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a house per day.
   - Mr. Black works for 6 days, so he completes \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a house.

3. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Together, they complete \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - So, \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

4. **Remaining work to be done by Mr. Blue:**
   - The total contract is for 3 houses, so the remaining work is \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} \).
   - Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: \( 3 = \frac{36}{12} \).
   - Remaining work: \( \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

5. **Calculate the time for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a house per day.
   - To complete \( \frac{11}{12} \) of a house, it will take him \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract.

B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of a hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understanding the structure:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of 3 cm (since 5 cm - 2*1 cm = 3 cm).

2. **Number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube (5 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) is also made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so it contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Cubes that are part of the hollow structure:**
   - The hollow cube is formed by the outer layer of the 5 cm cube minus the inner 3 cm cube.
   - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that form the hollow structure is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Painting the outer surface:**
   - When the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, only the outermost layer of smaller cubes is painted.
   - Each face of the 5 cm cube has \(5 \times 5 = 25\) smaller cubes.
   - There are 6 faces, so \(6 \times 25 = 150\) smaller cube faces are painted.

5. **Unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - Total number of faces for all smaller cubes in the hollow structure is \(98 \times 6 = 588\).
   - Since 150 faces are painted, the number of unpainted faces is \(588 - 150 = 438\).

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 438.

E)44",C,"To solve this problem, let's first define the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers. Let the first number be \( n \), then the numbers are \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \).

The sum of these numbers is:
\[
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20
\]

We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we need:
\[
\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square}
\]

Simplifying the expression:
\[
\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2}
\]

Let \(\frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2\), where \(k\) is an integer. Then:
\[
n + 4 = 2k^2
\]
\[
n = 2k^2 - 4
\]

Since \(n\) is a two-digit odd number, we have:
\[
10 \leq n \leq 99
\]

Substituting for \(n\):
\[
10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99

Adding 4 to all parts:
\[
14 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103

Dividing by 2:
\[
7 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5
\]

The integer values of \(k^2\) within this range are \(9, 16, 25, 36, 49\) (since these are the perfect squares between 7 and 51.5).

Now, calculate \(n\) for each \(k^2\):
- If \(k^2 = 9\), \(n = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 16\), \(n = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 25\), \(n = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 36\), \(n = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68\) (not odd)
- If \(k^2 = 49\), \(n = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94\) (odd)

The only valid two-digit odd number is 94. Now, we need to check which of the given options can be one of these 5 numbers.

The 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from 94 are: 94, 96, 98, 100, 102. However, these are not all odd, so let's check the numbers around 94.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
- \( y \) as the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

According to the problem, Sachin's current batting average is 51. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = 51 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 51x
\]

In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs, and his new batting average becomes 54. Therefore, the total number of matches played becomes \( x + 1 \), and the total runs scored becomes \( y + 78 \). So, we have:

Substitute \( y = 51x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{51x + 78}{x + 1} = 54

   - With \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) single letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 different letters from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve the problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then calculate its perimeter.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given area and the expression for the length, we have:
\[ (4b + 1) \times b = 150 \]

Expanding this equation, we get:
\[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

The square root of 2401 is 49. So, the solutions for \( b \) are:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

Calculating the two possible values for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

The dimensions of the rectangle are 6 meters by 25 meters.

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters} \]

Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

Let's calculate the total work in terms of large cakes:

1. Large cakes: 20 large cakes are needed. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes. Therefore, the number of helpers needed for large cakes is 20 large cakes / 6 large cakes per helper = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers.

Now, let's calculate the total work in terms of small cakes:

2. Small cakes: 700 small cakes are needed. Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes. Therefore, the number of helpers needed for small cakes is 700 small cakes / 105 small cakes per helper = 6.67 helpers. Again, we round up to 7 helpers.

Finally, we need to combine the helpers needed for both tasks. Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we add the number of helpers needed for large cakes and small cakes:

Total helpers = 4 (for large cakes) + 7 (for small cakes) = 11 helpers.

However, since the tasks can be done simultaneously and we have rounded up in both cases, we should check if fewer helpers can meet both requirements. Let's try with 10 helpers:

- 10 helpers can make 10 * 6 = 60 large cakes in 3 hours, which is more than enough for 20 large cakes.
- 10 helpers can make 10 * 105 = 1050 small cakes in 3 hours, which is more than enough for 700 small cakes.

Therefore, 10 helpers are sufficient to meet both requirements.

A)12/25

C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
- \( R \) as the amount of falafel in one roll.
- \( B \) as the amount of falafel in one baguette.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls:
   \[
   6P = 2R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3P
   \]

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes:
   \[
   3R = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = \frac{3R}{5}
   \]

Now, we need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes:
\[
2B = ?P
\]

First, substitute \( R = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{3R}{5} = \frac{3(3P)}{5} = \frac{9P}{5}
\]

Now, calculate \( 2B \):
\[
2B = 2 \times \frac{9P}{5} = \frac{18P}{5}
\]

We need to find how many pita breads (\( x \)) contain the same amount of falafel as \( 2B \):
\[
xP = \frac{18P}{5}

Divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):
\[

Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \(\frac{18}{5}\) pita breads.

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount. Therefore, the discounted price is:
\[ P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price \( P \). To find the percentage increase needed from the discounted price \( 0.80P \) to the original price \( P \), we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Here, the ""New Price"" is the original price \( P \), and the ""Old Price"" is the discounted price \( 0.80P \).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - 0.80P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\%

Simplify the expression:
\[
= \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\%

The \( P \) terms cancel out:
\[
= \left( \frac{0.20}{0.80} \right) \times 100\%

Calculate the fraction:
\[
= \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\%

1. **Calculate the total width of the pickets:**
   - Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
   - For x pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Calculate the total space between the pickets:**
   - There are x pickets, which means there are \( x - 1 \) spaces between them.

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's denote:
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_p = 10v_s \) as the speed of the plane (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).
- \( t_s \) as the time the ship has traveled when they meet.
- \( t_p \) as the time the plane has traveled when they meet.

Given that the ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts, we have:
- The distance traveled by the ship when they meet: \( d_s = v_s \cdot t_s \).
- The distance traveled by the plane when they meet: \( d_p = v_p \cdot t_p \).

Since the plane starts after the ship has traveled 180 miles, the time the plane travels is less than the time the ship travels by the time it took the ship to travel 180 miles. Therefore:
\[ t_p = t_s - \frac{180}{v_s} \]

The plane and the ship meet at the same point, so the distances they travel from the starting point are equal:
\[ v_s \cdot t_s = 180 + v_p \cdot t_p \]

Substitute \( v_p = 10v_s \) and \( t_p = t_s - \frac{180}{v_s} \) into the equation:
\[ v_s \cdot t_s = 180 + 10v_s \cdot \left(t_s - \frac{180}{v_s}\right) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ v_s \cdot t_s = 180 + 10v_s \cdot t_s - 1800 \]

Rearrange the terms:
\[ v_s \cdot t_s - 10v_s \cdot t_s = -1620 \]

Factor out \( v_s \cdot t_s \):
\[ -9v_s \cdot t_s = -1620 \]

Solve for \( v_s \cdot t_s \):
\[ v_s \cdot t_s = \frac{1620}{9} = 180 \]

Thus, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 miles (the distance the ship traveled) plus the additional distance the ship traveled after the plane started, which is also 180 miles. Therefore, the total distance from the starting point is:
\[ 180 + 180 = 360 \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

The ship travels 180 miles before the plane starts. When they meet, the plane has traveled the same additional distance as the ship since the plane started. Therefore, the total distance from the starting point is:
\[ 180 + \text{additional distance traveled by the ship} \]

The additional distance traveled by the ship is the same as the distance traveled by the plane from its start, which is:
\[ \frac{180}{9} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance from the starting point is:
\[ 180 + 20 = 200 \]

Let's denote the total deer population as \( N \).

The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is:

2. The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM. We need to find the probability that he catches the first train that arrives.

- If the man arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train at 5:02.

The time interval from 5:00 to 5:10 is 10 minutes. The time interval from 5:00 to 5:02 is 2 minutes.

The probability that the man catches the main line train is the ratio of the time interval for the main line train to the total time interval:

Probability = (Time interval for main line train) / (Total time interval)
             = 2 minutes / 10 minutes

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

This equation is not correct, which indicates that the population one year ago was not \( P \), but rather a different value. Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P_0 \).

The population one year ago, \( P_0 \), increased by some percentage to become \( P \) (the population today). We need to find this percentage increase.

Given that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, we have:

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle are \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]

3. **Solve for \( s \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140

     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

4. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for \( s \):**
   - The quadratic formula is \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
     \]
   - Solve for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{576}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - The possible solutions are:
     \[
     s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10
     \]
   - Since \( s \) must be positive, \( s = 14 \).

5. **Calculate the perimeter of the original square:**
   - The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \).

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{30} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
5x = 3 \times 30
\]

\[
5x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{90}{5} = 18

85,,"M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
2. \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).
3. \( M > N \).
4. \( M - N + 396c = 990 \).

First, let's express \( M - N \):

\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N = 99(a - c) \) into the equation:

\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Factor out 99 from the equation:

\[
99(a - c + 4c) = 990
\]

Simplify:

\[
99(a + 3c) = 990
\]

Divide both sides by 99:

\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( c \) such that \( a + 3c = 10 \) and \( M > N \).

Since \( M \) is a three-digit number, \( a \) ranges from 1 to 9, and \( c \) ranges from 0 to 9. Let's find the possible values of \( a \) and \( c \):

- If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) must be a single digit).
- If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 7 \).
- If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 4 \).
- If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 1 \).
- If \( c \geq 4 \), \( a \) becomes negative or zero, which is not possible.

Thus, the possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\).

Now, let's calculate \( M \) for each pair:

1. For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\):
   - \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
   - \( N = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 7 = 107 + 10b \)
   - \( M > N \) implies \( 701 + 10b > 107 + 10b \), which is always true.

2. For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\):
   - \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
   - \( N = 100 \times 2 + 10b + 4 = 204 + 10b \)
   - \( M > N \) implies \( 402 + 10b > 204 + 10b \), which is always true.

3. For \((a, c) = (1, 3)\):
   - \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)
   - \( N = 100 \times 3 + 10b + 1 = 301 + 10b \)
   - \( M > N \) implies \( 103 + 10b > 301 + 10b \), which is never true.

Thus, the valid pairs are \((7, 1)\) and \((4, 2)\).

For \((a, c) = (7, 1)\), \( M = 701 + 10b \) where \( b \) ranges from 0 to 9, giving 10 values of \( M \).

For \((a, c) = (4, 2)\), \( M = 402 + 10b \) where \( b \) ranges from 0 to 9, giving 10 values of \( M \).

Therefore, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

E)none of these",E,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school, given that more than 501 students are in the school, and 20% of them took only physics while 28% took only math.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( N \).

According to the problem:
- 20% of the students took only physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took only math: \( 0.28N \)

Since these percentages are of the total number of students, the sum of these percentages must be less than or equal to 100% of the students. Therefore, we have:
\[ 0.2N + 0.28N \leq N \]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[ 0.48N \leq N \]

This inequality is always true for any positive \( N \), so it doesn't help us directly find \( N \). However, we know that \( N \) must be greater than 501.

Now, let's check the given choices to find the least possible \( N \) that satisfies the condition of being more than 501 and also allows 20% and 28% to be whole numbers (since the number of students must be an integer).

Checking each option:
- \( N = 550 \): 
  - 20% of 550 = 110 (whole number)
  - 28% of 550 = 154 (whole number)
  - Total = 110 + 154 = 264, which is less than 550, so this is possible.

- \( N = 570 \):
  - 20% of 570 = 114 (whole number)
  - 28% of 570 = 159.6 (not a whole number)

- \( N = 600 \):
  - 20% of 600 = 120 (whole number)
  - 28% of 600 = 168 (whole number)
  - Total = 120 + 168 = 288, which is less than 600, so this is possible.

- \( N = 700 \):
  - 20% of 700 = 140 (whole number)
  - 28% of 700 = 196 (whole number)
  - Total = 140 + 196 = 336, which is less than 700, so this is possible.

The smallest \( N \) that satisfies all conditions is 550.

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's and Rahim's ages.

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Use the information about their ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the field that the cow can graze, and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area.

The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

So, the area \( A \) is:

\[ A \approx 615.75 \text{ square feet} \]

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.75}{10} \]

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Calculate the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP).

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP
   \]

   Given that SP = Rs 27.50, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50
   \]

   Solving for CP:

   \[
   CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs 25.00.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs 25.75, we need to compare this selling price to the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
   \]

   Since the result is positive, it is a profit of Rs 0.75.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{CP} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

Now we have:

- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two rotation times (13 minutes for Ball A and 7 minutes for Ball B) to determine when they will both be at the starting point again.

The prime factorization of 13 is 13 (since 13 is a prime number), and the prime factorization of 7 is 7 (since 7 is also a prime number). The LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest power of all prime factors present in the numbers.

Since 13 and 7 are both prime and do not share any common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers:

LCM(13, 7) = 13 * 7 = 91

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

We are given:
- Total number of books = 45

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the set of hardcover books
- \( F \) as the set of fiction books

We are looking for the maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \), the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets, we have:
\[ |H \cup F| = |H| + |F| - |H \cap F| \]

We know:
- \( |H| = 30 \)
- \( |F| = 20 \)
- \( |H \cup F| \leq 45 \) (since there are only 45 books in total)

Substituting these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[ |H \cup F| = 30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \]

Since \( |H \cup F| \leq 45 \), we have:
\[ 30 + 20 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]
\[ 50 - |H \cap F| \leq 45 \]
\[ |H \cap F| \geq 50 - 45 \]
\[ |H \cap F| \geq 5 \]

However, we are interested in the maximum value of \( |H \cap F| \). To find this, consider the constraints:
- The maximum number of hardcover books is 30.
- The maximum number of fiction books is 20.

The maximum overlap occurs when all fiction books are hardcover. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is the minimum of the number of hardcover books and the number of fiction books:
\[ |H \cap F| \leq \min(30, 20) = 20 \]

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total amount to be spent is Rs. 96.

If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \).

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them contributed \( \frac{96}{x} + 4 \).

The total contribution by the remaining friends is still Rs. 96, so we can set up the equation:

\[
(x - 4) \left(\frac{96}{x} + 4\right) = 96

Expanding the equation:

\[
(x - 4) \left(\frac{96}{x} + 4\right) = (x - 4) \cdot \frac{96}{x} + (x - 4) \cdot 4

\[
= 96 - \frac{384}{x} + 4x - 16

\[
= 4x + 80 - \frac{384}{x}

Setting this equal to 96:

\[
4x + 80 - \frac{384}{x} = 96

Simplifying:

\[
4x + 80 - 96 = \frac{384}{x}

\[
4x - 16 = \frac{384}{x}

Multiply through by \( x \) to clear the fraction:

\[
4x^2 - 16x = 384

Divide the entire equation by 4:

\[
x^2 - 4x = 96

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 20}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:

\[
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

or

\[
x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we have \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

The correct answer is:

A) 8",True,,,
96,,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the perimeter of the original rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ P = 88 \, \text{cm} \]

The wire is then rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is:

\[ P = 4 \times \text{side} \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side of the square. Then:

\[ 4s = 88 \]

Solving for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{88}{4} \]
\[ s = 22 \]

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

The correct answer is:

C) 22",True,,,
97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:
\[
2x + 16x + 25x = 43x
\]

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so we set up the equation:
\[
43x = 8600
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
\]

Now, we need to find out how much each daughter receives, which is \( 4x \):
\[
4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
\]

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

The correct answer is:
```
E) Rs 800

98,,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"To solve the problem, let's denote Meenu's weight as \( M \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ M = 29 + \frac{M}{2} \]

To solve for \( M \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2M = 58 + M \]

Next, we subtract \( M \) from both sides to isolate \( M \):

\[ 2M - M = 58 \]

\[ M = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

The correct answer is:

D) 58",True,,,
