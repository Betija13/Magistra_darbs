0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of angles of elevation.

Let's denote:
- \( h \) as the height of the tower.
- \( x_1 \) as the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
- \( x_2 \) as the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.

From the problem, we know:
- The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.

Using the tangent of the angles:
1. When the angle of elevation is 45°:
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies h = x_1
   \]

2. When the angle of elevation is 60°:
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies h = x_2 \sqrt{3}
   \]

Since \( h = x_1 \) and \( h = x_2 \sqrt{3} \), we equate the two expressions for \( h \):
\[
x_1 = x_2 \sqrt{3}
\]

The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled is:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = x_2 \sqrt{3} - x_2 = x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)
\]

The speed of the car is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{10} = \frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}
\]

We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from \( x_2 \) to the base of the tower (distance \( x_2 \)):
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{x_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{x_2}{\frac{x_2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]

The denominator simplifies as follows:
\[
(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1) = (\sqrt{3})^2 - (1)^2 = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Thus, the time is:
\[
\frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
\]

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

The correct answer is:

A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the $20-off coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer pays is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8
   \]
   Divide by 0.56 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} = 78.2142857

   - 12 = 2^2 * 3

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.

C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to calculate the probability that both stocks do not increase.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

Assuming the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. This implies considering the worst-case scenario where the events are mutually exclusive, meaning the probability of neither occurring is maximized.

In this case, the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} \]

Given that the profit is 20%, we can express the selling price in terms of the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so:

\[ 360 = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} \]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ \text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} \]

\[ \text{Cost Price} = 300 \]

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and put back into the bag. So, there are 20 black marbles in the bag.

A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session.

First, calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom night:
- 45% of 200 students = 0.45 * 200 = 90 students

Next, calculate the minimum number of students who participated in the debating session:
- 35% of 200 students = 0.35 * 200 = 70 students

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap occurs when the minimum number of students attended both events.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the events is:
- Minimum number of students attending at least one event = (students attending prom) + (students attending debate) - (students attending both)
- Since we want to maximize the number of students who attended neither, we assume the overlap is as large as possible, which is when all students who attended the debate also attended the prom.

Therefore, the minimum number of students attending at least one event is:
- 90 (prom attendees) + 70 (debate attendees) - 70 (overlap) = 90 students

Thus, the maximum number of students who attended neither event is:
- Total students - Minimum number attending at least one event = 200 - 90 = 110 students

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 110.

- The production cost per component is $110.

Total production cost for the year = 420 units/month * 12 months * $110/unit = $554,400.

Next, calculate the total revenue needed to achieve the desired profit:
- Desired yearly profit = $626,400.

Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,080,800.

Now, calculate the minimum selling price per component:
- Total units produced and sold in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.

Minimum selling price per component = Total revenue needed / Total units sold.

Minimum selling price per component = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.68.

Let's denote:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1:**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - You reach the bottom in 10 minutes.

2. **Scenario 2:**
   - You walk 10 steps and then stop.
   - You reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

For both scenarios, the total time to reach the bottom is the same, so we can set up equations based on the time taken by walking and the elevator.

### Scenario 1:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- Total time = 10 minutes.
- Time taken by the elevator to cover \( S - 20 \) steps = 10 minutes.
- Therefore, \( S - 20 = 10v \).

### Scenario 2:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- Total time = 20 minutes.
- Time taken by the elevator to cover \( S - 10 \) steps = 20 minutes.
- Therefore, \( S - 10 = 20v \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v

\[
10 = 10v

\[
v = 1

Let's break down the information given:

1. The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total score of all students}}{z} = y \implies \text{Total score of all students} = zy

The total score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scores is:
\[
\text{Total score of remaining students} = \text{Total score of all students} - (H + L) = zy - 2x

First, let's find out how much profit the grocer makes per bag. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price:

Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25

Now, we know the total profit is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags = 120

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. \( 7x \approx 9y \) (since they worked for almost the same number of hours).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From equation 1, we have:
\[ x = 35 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 35 - y \) into equation 2:
\[ 7(35 - y) \approx 9y \]

Expanding the equation:
\[ 245 - 7y \approx 9y \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 245 \approx 16y \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ y \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ y \approx 15.3125 \]

E)6780",A,"To solve this problem, we need to find a 4-digit number that is divisible by 16, 10, and 8. This number represents the total number of students in the class.

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \(2^4\).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \(2 \times 5\).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \(2^3\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^4\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\).

Thus, the LCM is \(2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80\).

Now, we need to find the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers that are divisible by 80.

1. **Smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We divide 1000 by 80 to find the smallest multiple:

   \[
   1000 \div 80 = 12.5

2. **Largest 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The largest 4-digit number is 9999. We divide 9999 by 80 to find the largest multiple:

   \[
   9999 \div 80 = 124.9875

   The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124. Therefore, the largest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 124 = 9920

E)$91.00",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance.

Let's denote the cost price of the appliance as \( C \).

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above the cost price, which means the selling price \( S \) is given by:

\[ S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C \]

We are also told that the gross profit is $20.00. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

\[ S - C = 20 \]

Substituting the expression for \( S \) from above:

\[ 1.4C - C = 20 \]

\[ 0.4C = 20 \]

To find \( C \), divide both sides by 0.4:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. According to the problem, the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours. Therefore, the distance for the forward journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[ 2v = 48 \]

A)1584

E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet and then calculate its area.

Let's denote the length and width of the original rectangular sheet as \( L \) and \( W \), respectively.

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**

   When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the folded dimension is half of one of the original dimensions.

   - If the sheet is folded along the length, then the new dimensions are \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{L}{2} + W \right) = 48
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     L + 2W = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**

   When the sheet is folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.

   - If the sheet is folded along the width, then the new dimensions are \( L \) and \( \frac{W}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of the folded part is:
     \[
     2 \left( L + \frac{W}{2} \right) = 66
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2L + W = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
L + 2W &= 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
2L + W &= 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
\[
2L + 4W = 96
\]

Now subtract Equation 2 from this result:
\[
(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66
\]
\[
3W = 30
\]
\[
W = 10

Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
L + 2(10) = 48
\]
\[
L + 20 = 48
\]
\[
L = 28
\]

Now that we have the dimensions of the original sheet, \( L = 28 \) cm and \( W = 10 \) cm, we can find the area:
\[
\text{Area} = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \, \text{cm}^2

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Re-evaluate the equations:
- From Equation 1: \( L + 2W = 48 \)
- From Equation 2: \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Re-solve the system:
Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
\[
2L + 4W = 96

Subtract Equation 2:
\[
(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66

\[
3W = 30

\[
W = 10

Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1:

When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, the selling price is \( 0.95M \).

When the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, the selling price is \( 0.93M \).

According to the problem, the difference in profit between giving a 5% discount and a 7% discount is Rs. 15. This means:

The student was supposed to find \( \frac{7}{8} \) of the number, which is \( \frac{7}{8}x \).

Instead, the student found \( \frac{7}{18} \) of the number, which is \( \frac{7}{18}x \).

According to the problem, the difference between these two results is 770:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
\]

To solve for \( x \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

Convert the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{8 \times 9} = \frac{63}{72}

Let's assume each side of the square is of length \(d\).

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance traveled is \(4d\).

2. **Total Time**: The time taken to travel each side is given by the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).

   - Time for the first side: \( \frac{d}{200} \)

D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees, then the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Combine the terms with \( b \):

\[ b(x + y) + x = 100 \]

Since \( x + y = 18 \), substitute this into the equation:

\[ b(18) + x = 100 \]

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, solve the system of equations:

1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( 18b + x = 100 \)

From equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 18 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 18 - x \) into equation 2:

\[ 18b + x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into \( y = 18 - x \):

\[ y = 18 - (100 - 18b) \]

\[ y = 18 - 100 + 18b \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations. Since \( x = 100 - 18b \) and \( y = 18b - 82 \) must be non-negative integers, let's test the choices:

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much work each painter completes and then determine how much work is left for Mr. Blue.

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Brown = \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - Work done by Mr. Black = \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - Total work needed = 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time for Mr. Blue = \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract. The correct answer is:

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

According to the problem, when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( k^2 \) be this perfect square:
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \]
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( k \) such that \( n \) is a two-digit odd number.

Let's test some values of \( k \):

1. \( k = 3 \):
   \[ n = 2(3)^2 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \] (not odd)

2. \( k = 4 \):

7. \( k = 9 \):
   \[ n = 2(9)^2 - 4 = 162 - 4 = 158 \] (not a two-digit number)

Let's go back and check if we made a mistake in the sequence. We need to find a sequence where one of the numbers is in the choices.

- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.1x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of all these groups should equal the total number of students:

\[

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x = 0.98x

Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This equation implies that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.

Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions for \( r + t \) are equal, we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we find:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 50 \), we can find the difference between R's age and Q's age:

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we have:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This implies:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Substituting \( t = 50 - r \) into the equation \( r - 25 = 25 - t \), we get:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - 50 + r \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means the difference between R's age and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can find:

\[ r - 25 = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - 25 = r - 25 \]

Thus, the difference between R's age and Q's age is:

\[ r - q = q - t = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we have:

\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) \]
\[ r - q = r - 25 \]

Therefore, the difference between R's age and Q's age is 0, which is not listed in the choices. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
51x + 78 = 54(x + 1)

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, the number of different pairs of letters is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 letters out of \( n \).

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:
\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

Now, solve for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2401} = 49 \), we have:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives two possible solutions for \( b \):
1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \) (not possible since breadth cannot be negative)

Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters.

Now, calculate the length \( l \):
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \text{ meters} \]

Finally, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:

- A helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make:
  \(2 \text{ large cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ large cakes}\)

- A helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make:

   - Large cakes one helper can make in 3 hours: 6
   - Helpers needed for large cakes:

   - Helpers needed for small cakes:
     \(\lceil \frac{700}{105} \rceil = \lceil 6.67 \rceil = 7\) helpers

Finally, we need to find the total number of helpers required. Since the tasks can be done simultaneously, we need the maximum of the two:

- Total helpers needed = max(4, 7) = 7

However, since the tasks are independent and we need to ensure both tasks are completed, we should add the helpers needed for each task:

- Total helpers needed = 4 (for large cakes) + 7 (for small cakes) = 11

Since 11 is not an option, let's re-evaluate the approach. We need to ensure that the total work done by the helpers meets the requirement for both types of cakes. 

Let's consider the total work in terms of ""cake-hours"":

- Total large cake-hours needed: \(20 \text{ large cakes} \times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{2 \text{ large cakes}} = 10 \text{ hours}\)
- Total small cake-hours needed: \(700 \text{ small cakes} \times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{35 \text{ small cakes}} = 20 \text{ hours}\)

Total cake-hours needed = 10 + 20 = 30 hours

Each helper works for 3 hours, so the number of helpers needed is:

- Total helpers needed = \(\lceil \frac{30 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ hours/helper}} \rceil = \lceil 10 \rceil = 10\)

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST. Therefore, SU = ST / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

Now, we need to find RU. Since R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and we know RS = 5 and RT = 17, we can find RU by considering the position of U relative to R.

The total length from R to T is RT = 17. Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, the point U is 11 units away from S (because SU = 11).

RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16.

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match any of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate:

Since U is the midpoint of ST, and ST = 22, the point U is 11 units away from T (because TU = 11).

To find RU, we can consider the following:
- From R to T is 17 units (RT = 17).
- From T to U is 11 units (TU = 11).

Therefore, the length from R to U is:
RU = RT - TU = 17 - 11 = 6.

Thus, the length of line segment RU is 6.

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

1. **Relationship between pita breads and rolls:**
   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads.

2. **Relationship between rolls and baguettes:**
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

3. **Combining the relationships:**
   - From the first relationship, 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
   - From the second relationship, 1 roll = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

   Equating the two expressions for 1 roll:
   \[
   3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ baguettes}
   \]

   Solving for 1 baguette in terms of pita breads:
   \[
   1 \text{ baguette} = \frac{3}{5} \times 3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{9}{5} \text{ pita breads}
   \]

4. **Finding the number of pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes:**
   - 2 baguettes = \( 2 \times \frac{9}{5} \) pita breads
   - 2 baguettes = \( \frac{18}{5} \) pita breads

Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \( \frac{18}{5} \) pita breads.

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price from \( 0.80P \) back to \( P \).

Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \).

The increased price should be equal to the original price:
\[ 0.80P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.80 \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1 \]

\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.80} \]

Let's denote:
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_p = 10v_s \) as the speed of the plane (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts until they meet.

In that time \( t \), the ship travels an additional distance of \( v_s \times t \), and the plane travels a distance of \( 10v_s \times t \).

At the point they meet, the total distance traveled by the ship is:
\[ 180 + v_s \times t \]

The total distance traveled by the plane is:
\[ 10v_s \times t \]

Since they meet at the same point, these distances are equal:
\[ 180 + v_s \times t = 10v_s \times t \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ 180 = 9v_s \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9v_s} \]

The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 and 5:10. We need to determine the probability that he catches the first train that arrives.

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population two years from now can be expressed as:

\[ P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

The problem states that this future population is exactly double the population of one year ago:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

To find the population increase over the last year, we need to determine the population one year ago compared to the current population. Let's denote the current population as \( P_{\text{current}} \).

Since the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, we can express the current population as:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \]

Now, we need to find the percent increase from one year ago to the current population:

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{P_{\text{current}} - P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute \( P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \):

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{P \times 1.1 - P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{0.1P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = 10\% \]

However, this is not one of the choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The key is to find the percent increase over the last year, given that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago.

Since the population two years from now is \( P \times 1.21 \) and is double the population one year ago, the population one year ago must have been:

\[ \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} = P \]

This means the population one year ago was \( \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \).

Now, let's find the percent increase from this population one year ago to the current population:

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{P - \frac{P \times 1.21}{2}}{\frac{P \times 1.21}{2}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{2P - P \times 1.21}{P \times 1.21} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{2 - 1.21}{1.21} \right) \times 100\% \]

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{30} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
5x = 3 \times 30

\[
5x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{90}{5} = 18

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"To solve the problem, let's first express the numbers \( M \) and \( N \) in terms of their digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Given:
- \( M = 100a + 10b + c \)
- \( N = 100c + 10b + a \)

We know:
- \( M > N \)
- \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

First, calculate \( M - N \):
\[
M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
\]

Substitute \( M - N \) into the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a - 99c + 396c = 990
\]
\[
99a + 297c = 990
\]

Divide the entire equation by 99:
\[
a + 3c = 10
\]

Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0-9), we need to find integer solutions for \( a \) and \( c \) such that \( a + 3c = 10 \).

Let's find the possible values for \( c \):
- If \( c = 0 \), \( a = 10 \) (not possible since \( a \) is a digit)
- If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \)
- If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \)
- If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \)
- If \( c = 4 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 4 = -2 \) (not possible since \( a \) is a digit)

Thus, the possible pairs \((a, c)\) are:
- \( (7, 1) \)
- \( (4, 2) \)
- \( (1, 3) \)

Now, calculate \( M \) for each pair:
- For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
- For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
- For \( (a, c) = (1, 3) \), \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)

We need to find how many values of \( M \) are more than 300.

1. For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), \( M = 701 + 10b \). All values are greater than 300.
   - \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.

2. For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), \( M = 402 + 10b \). All values are greater than 300.
   - \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.

3. For \( (a, c) = (1, 3) \), \( M = 103 + 10b \). Only values where \( M > 300 \) are needed.
   - \( 103 + 10b > 300 \)
   - \( 10b > 197 \)
   - \( b > 19.7 \)
   - \( b \) can be 8 or 9, giving 2 values.

Adding these up, the total number of values of \( M \) that are more than 300 is:

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( N \).

According to the problem:
- 20% of the students took only physics: \( 0.2N \)
- 28% of the students took only math: \( 0.28N \)

Since these percentages represent the number of students, they must be whole numbers. Therefore, both \( 0.2N \) and \( 0.28N \) must be integers.

For \( 0.2N \) to be an integer, \( N \) must be a multiple of 5.
For \( 0.28N \) to be an integer, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25 (since 28% = 7/25).

The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( N \) must be a multiple of 25.

Let's denote Rahim's current age as \( R \).

According to the problem, Raj is currently 17 years old. Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.

The problem states that 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, 5 years ago, Rahim's age was 3 times Raj's age at that time.

Thus, we can write the equation for Rahim's age 5 years ago as:
\[ R - 5 = 3 \times 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R - 5 = 36 \]

A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze, which is determined by the length of the rope. The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so it can graze in a circular area with a radius equal to the length of the rope.

The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius \( r \) is 14 feet.

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (14)^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]
\[ \text{Area} \approx 615.44 \, \text{sq.ft.} \]

The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area, we divide the total area by the grazing rate per day:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \]
\[ \text{Days} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62 days. However, since the choices provided are in increments of 10, the closest choice is 61 days.

B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%.

Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The selling price with a 10% profit is given by:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.10C = 1.10C \]

We know the selling price is Rs 27.50, so:
\[ 1.10C = 27.50 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \]

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to determine the profit or loss percentage.

The selling price in this case is Rs 25.75, and the cost price is Rs 25.

The profit or loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \]

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

The profit percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25} \right) \times 100 = 3\% \]

Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.

Now, we need to consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. In any arrangement of Susan, Tim, and Zen, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is to the left of Tim, or Tim is to the left of Susan.

Since these two possibilities are equally likely, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:

holidays. The bill for that month would be :
A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given data:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( F \) and \( V \).

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute it back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we know:
- The fixed part of the bill \( F = 180 \)
- The variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[
= 180 + 1500

\[
= 1680

E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again simultaneously. This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation.

Now, find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes:

- The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).
- The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).

Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers and have no common factors other than 1, the LCM is simply their product: 13 * 7 = 91 minutes.

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The cost for newspapers on a regular weekday is $1 each, so the cost for newspapers from Monday to Saturday is:
\[ 6x \times 1 = 6x \]

The cost for newspapers on Sunday is $4 each, so the cost for newspapers on Sunday is:

Let the original number of friends be \( x \).

The total amount to be spent is Rs. 96.

If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would contribute \( \frac{96}{x} \).

Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended is \( x - 4 \).

The new contribution per person is \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the new contribution per person is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution per person:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4

Now, solve this equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} - \frac{96}{x} = 4

Find a common denominator and simplify:

\[
\frac{96x - 96(x - 4)}{x(x - 4)} = 4
\]

\[
\frac{96x - 96x + 384}{x(x - 4)} = 4

\[
\frac{384}{x(x - 4)} = 4

Multiply both sides by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
384 = 4x(x - 4)

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
96 = x(x - 4)

\[
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-96)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2}

The two possible solutions are:
