C)(zx – y)/(z – 2)
D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)",D,"D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
------
To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. According to the problem, the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so we have:
   \[
   \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
   \]

2. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. Therefore, the total sum of all scores is:
   \[
   zy
   \]

3. To find the sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest scores, we subtract H and L from the total sum:
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores excluding H and L} = zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x
   \]

4. The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is \(z - 2\).

5. The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Sum of scores excluding H and L}}{\text{Number of students excluding H and L}} = \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
------
D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
------
D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
------
To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is x. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
     \]
   - The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. Therefore, the total score for the class is:
     \[
     zy
     \]

2. **Calculate the total score excluding the highest and lowest scores:**
   - The total score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scores is:
     \[
     \text{Total score excluding } H \text{ and } L = zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x
     \]

3. **Determine the number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - Since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers, the number of students considered is:
     \[
     z - 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the average score excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Total score excluding } H \text{ and } L}{\text{Number of students excluding } H \text{ and } L} = \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}

------
To solve the equation \([5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 \times 13 - 156] = 6\), we need to find the value of ""?"".

First, simplify the denominator:
\[ 13 \times 13 = 169 \]
\[ 169 - 156 = 13 \]

Now, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6 \]

Simplify the numerator:
\[ 5 - 15 - 7 = -17 \]
So, the equation is:
\[ \frac{? \times 19 - 17}{13} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ ? \times 19 - 17 = 78 \]

Add 17 to both sides:
\[ ? \times 19 = 95 \]

Divide both sides by 19 to solve for ""?"":
\[ ? = \frac{95}{19} \]
\[ ? = 5 \]

The correct answer is (C) 5.

(C)
------
To solve the equation \([5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 \times 13 - 156] = 6\), let's break it down step by step.

1. **Denominator Calculation:**
   - Calculate \(13 \times 13\): 
     \[
     13 \times 13 = 169
     \]
   - Subtract 156 from 169:
     \[
     169 - 156 = 13
     \]

2. **Numerator Calculation:**
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     [5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7] = 6 \times 13
     \]
   - Calculate \(6 \times 13\):
     \[
     6 \times 13 = 78
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the brackets:
     \[
     5 - 15 - 7 = -17
     \]
   - The equation now is:
     \[
     ? \times 19 - 17 = 78
     \]
   - Add 17 to both sides:
     \[
     ? \times 19 = 95
     \]
   - Divide by 19 to solve for ?:
     \[
     ? = \frac{95}{19} = 5
     \]

The correct answer is (C) 5.

B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"(E)2.85 miles
------
B)2.25 miles
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, given that his speed is reduced by 4 mph from his usual speed of 15 mph.

1. Calculate Bill's speed on a windy day:
   - Normal speed = 15 mph
   - Reduction in speed = 4 mph
   - Windy day speed = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

2. Convert 21 minutes into hours, since the speed is given in miles per hour:
   - 21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

3. Calculate the distance traveled using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes is 3.85 miles.

C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"B)144km
------
(B)144km
------
(B)144km
------
To solve the problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep.

1. Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be \( x \) km/hr.
2. The time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours.
3. Therefore, the distance for the forward journey is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = x \times 6 = 6x \).

4. During the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed is \( x + 12 \) km/hr.
5. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.
6. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = (x + 12) \times 4 = 4(x + 12) \).

Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ 6x = 4(x + 12) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 6x = 4x + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:

\[ 2x = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 24 \) back into the expression for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = 6x = 6 \times 24 = 144 \text{ km} \]

The distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

The correct answer is (B) 144km.
------
To solve the problem, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep.

1. Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be \( x \) km/hr.
2. The time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours.
3. Therefore, the distance for the forward journey is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = x \times 6 = 6x \).

4. During the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed is \( x + 12 \) km/hr.
5. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.
6. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = (x + 12) \times 4 = 4(x + 12) \).

Since the distance traveled in both journeys is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ 6x = 4(x + 12) \]

7. Solve the equation:
   - Expand the right side: \( 4(x + 12) = 4x + 48 \)
   - Set the equation: \( 6x = 4x + 48 \)
   - Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides: \( 2x = 48 \)
   - Divide by 2: \( x = 24 \)

8. Substitute \( x = 24 \) back into the distance formula for the forward journey:
   - Distance = \( 6x = 6 \times 24 = 144 \) km

The distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

B)2%
C)5%
D)9%
E)10%",D,"(C)5%
------
C)5%
------
(D)
------
To solve the problem, we need to determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

1. **Identify the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% are vanilla flavored.

3. **Calculate the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates:**
   - 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed.

4. **Calculate the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - If 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed.

5. **Calculate the percentage of total chocolates that are vanilla and not squashed:**
   - 10% of the 90% vanilla chocolates are not squashed, which is 0.10 * 90% = 9% of the total chocolates.

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.

The correct answer is (D) 9%.

To find the length of the other side of Julie's rectangular yard, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

Area = width × length

We are given that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet and one side (the width) is 100 feet. We need to find the length.

Let's denote the length of the other side as L. According to the formula:

3,000 = 100 × L

To find L, we divide both sides of the equation by 100:

L = 3,000 / 100
L = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

The correct option is (A) 30 feet.

C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"A)2% Profit
------
(A)
------
(B)3% Profit
------
(A)
------
To solve this, we first need to find the cost price of the book.

Given that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, we can use the formula for selling price with profit:

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
Profit = (Profit Percentage / 100) * Cost Price

So, 27.50 = Cost Price + (10/100) * Cost Price
27.50 = Cost Price * (1 + 0.10)
27.50 = Cost Price * 1.10

Cost Price = 27.50 / 1.10
Cost Price = 25

Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we need to calculate the profit or loss percentage.

Selling Price = Rs 25.75
Cost Price = Rs 25

Profit/Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25
Profit/Loss = 0.75

Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, it is a profit.

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit Percentage = 3%

Therefore, the percentage of profit is 3%.
