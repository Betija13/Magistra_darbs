0,,"Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?",E,"Let the speed of Friend Q be \( v \) km/h. Then the speed of Friend P, being 15% faster, is \( 1.15v \) km/h.

When they walk towards each other, their combined speed is:
\[
v + 1.15v = 2.15v \text{ km/h}
\]

The total distance they need to cover together is 43 km. The time \( t \) it takes for them to meet can be calculated as:
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{43}{2.15v}
\]

During this time, Friend P will have walked a distance of:
\[
\text{Distance walked by P} = \text{speed of P} \times t = 1.15v \times t
\]
Substituting for \( t \):
\[
\text{Distance walked by P} = 1.15v \times \frac{43}{2.15v}
\]

The \( v \) cancels out:
\[
\text{Distance walked by P} = 1.15 \times \frac{43}{2.15}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{43}{2.15} \):
\[
\frac{43}{2.15} \approx 20
\]
Now multiplying by 1.15:
\[
\text{Distance walked by P} \approx 1.15 \times 20 \approx 23
\]

Thus, the distance that Friend P has walked when they pass each other is approximately 23 km.

The answer is:
E) 23",False,,,
1,,"In the coordinate plane, points (x, 1) and (5, y) are on line k. If line k passes through the origin and has slope 1/5, then what are the values of x and y respectively?",C,"To find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) for the points \( (x, 1) \) and \( (5, y) \) on line \( k \) with slope \( \frac{1}{5} \) that passes through the origin, we can use the slope formula.

The equation of line \( k \) can be expressed as:
\[
y = \frac{1}{5}x
\]

1. For the point \( (x, 1) \):
   \[
   1 = \frac{1}{5}x
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 5 gives:
   \[
   5 = x
   \]

2. For the point \( (5, y) \):
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{5}(5)
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   y = 1
   \]

Thus, the values of \( x \) and \( y \) are \( 5 \) and \( 1 \) respectively.

The answer is:
C) 5 and 1

So the final answer is:
C",False,,,
2,,"For all numbers p and q, the operation @ is defined by p@q = p^2 - pq. If xy ≠ 0, then which of the following can be equal to zero?
I. x@y
II. (xy)@y
III. x@(x + y)",B,"To determine which expressions can be equal to zero, we will analyze each option using the operation defined by \( p @ q = p^2 - pq \).

1. **I. \( x @ y \)**:
   \[
   x @ y = x^2 - xy
   \]
   Setting this equal to zero:
   \[
   x^2 - xy = 0 \implies x(x - y) = 0
   \]
   Since \( xy \neq 0 \), \( x \neq 0 \). Therefore, \( x - y = 0 \) implies \( x = y \). So, \( x @ y = 0 \) is possible if \( x = y \).

2. **II. \( (xy) @ y \)**:
   \[
   (xy) @ y = (xy)^2 - (xy)y = x^2y^2 - xy^2 = xy^2(x - 1)
   \]
   Setting this equal to zero:
   \[
   xy^2(x - 1) = 0
   \]
   Since \( xy \neq 0 \) and \( y^2 \neq 0 \), we have \( x - 1 = 0 \) which implies \( x = 1 \). Thus, \( (xy) @ y = 0 \) is possible if \( x = 1 \).

3. **III. \( x @ (x + y) \)**:
   \[
   x @ (x + y) = x^2 - x(x + y) = x^2 - (x^2 + xy) = -xy
   \]
   Setting this equal to zero:
   \[
   -xy = 0
   \]
   This is not possible since \( xy \neq 0 \).

Now we summarize the findings:
- I can be zero if \( x = y \).
- II can be zero if \( x = 1 \).
- III cannot be zero.

Thus, the expressions that can be equal to zero are I and II.

The correct answer is **B) I and II**.",False,,,
3,,"Carl is facing very difficult financial times and can only pay the interest on a $10,000 loan he has taken. The bank charges him a quarterly compound rate of 4%. What is the approximate interest he pays annually?",A,"To calculate the annual interest Carl pays on a $10,000 loan with a quarterly compound interest rate of 4%, we first need to determine the quarterly interest amount.

1. **Quarterly Interest Rate**: Since the bank charges a quarterly compound rate of 4%, this means that the interest for each quarter is 4% of the principal.

   \[
   \text{Quarterly Interest} = 10,000 \times 0.04 = 400
   \]

2. **Annual Interest**: Since there are 4 quarters in a year, we multiply the quarterly interest by 4 to find the annual interest.

   \[
   \text{Annual Interest} = 400 \times 4 = 1600
   \]

Thus, the approximate interest Carl pays annually is $1600.

The correct answer is:
A)",False,,,
4,,"The speed at which a man can row a boat in still water is 25 kmph. If he rows downstream, where the speed of current is 11 kmph, what time will he take to cover 80 metres?",E,"To find the time taken to cover 80 meters while rowing downstream, we first need to calculate the effective speed of the boat when rowing downstream.

The speed of the boat in still water is 25 kmph, and the speed of the current is 11 kmph. Therefore, the effective speed downstream is:

Effective speed downstream = Speed of boat + Speed of current
= 25 kmph + 11 kmph
= 36 kmph

Next, we need to convert this speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second. We can use the conversion factor:

1 kmph = (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 1/3.6 meters per second.

So, to convert 36 kmph to meters per second:

Effective speed downstream in m/s = 36 kmph × (1/3.6) m/s
= 10 m/s.

Now, we can calculate the time taken to cover 80 meters using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed.

Distance = 80 meters,
Speed = 10 m/s.

Time = 80 meters / 10 m/s = 8 seconds.

Thus, the time taken to cover 80 meters is 8 seconds.

The correct answer is (E).",False,,,
5,,"There are k-2 members in a certain band, including Jim and Ellen. Two members are to be selected to attend the Grammy awards ceremony. If there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected, what is the value of k?",A,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of members in the band, denoted as \( k \), given that there are \( k-2 \) members excluding Jim and Ellen.

The total number of members in the band is \( k \), and the number of ways to choose 2 members from \( k \) members is given by the combination formula \( \binom{k}{2} \).

When Jim and Ellen are not selected, we are left with \( k-2 \) members. The number of ways to choose 2 members from these \( k-2 \) members is \( \binom{k-2}{2} \).

According to the problem, we know that:
\[
\binom{k-2}{2} = 6
\]

The combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \) is calculated as:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
For \( r = 2 \), this simplifies to:
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\binom{k-2}{2} = \frac{(k-2)(k-3)}{2} = 6
\]

To solve for \( k \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
(k-2)(k-3) = 12
\]

Next, we expand the left side:
\[
k^2 - 5k + 6 = 12
\]
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:
\[
k^2 - 5k - 6 = 0
\]

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:
\[
(k-6)(k+1) = 0
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives us the possible solutions:
\[
k - 6 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 6
\]
\[
k + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = -1 \quad (\text{not a valid solution since } k \text{ must be positive})
\]

Since \( k = 6 \) does not match any of the provided choices, we need to re-evaluate our equation. 

We can also solve the quadratic using the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-6)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
k = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Calculating the two possible values:
\[
k = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad k = \frac{-2}{2} = -1
\]

Since \( k = 6 \) does not match any options, let's check the combinations again. 

We need to find \( k \) such that:
\[
(k-2)(k-3) = 12
\]
Testing values from the options:
- For \( k = 8 \): \( (8-2)(8-3) = 6 \cdot 5 = 30 \)
- For \( k = 9 \): \( (9-2)(9-3) = 7 \cdot 6 = 42 \)
- For \( k = 10 \): \( (10-2)(10-3) = 8 \cdot 7 = 56 \)
- For \( k = 11 \): \( (11-2)(11-3) = 9 \cdot 8 = 72 \)
- For \( k = 12 \): \( (12-2)(12-3) = 10 \cdot 9 = 90 \)

None of these match \( 12 \). 

Let's check the calculations again:
The equation \( (k-2)(k-3) = 12 \) gives:
- \( k = 8 \): \( 6 \cdot 5 = 30 \)
- \( k = 9 \): \( 7 \cdot 6 = 42 \)
- \( k = 10 \): \( 8 \cdot 7 = 56 \)
- \( k = 11 \): \( 9 \cdot 8 = 72 \)
- \( k = 12 \): \( 10 \cdot 9 = 90 \)

The correct answer must be found by checking the combinations again.

The correct answer is \( k = 8 \) because:
\[
(k-2)(k-3) = 12 \Rightarrow (8-2)(8-3) = 6 \cdot 5 = 30
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
**(A)**",False,,,
6,,"If (x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 ≤ x + 1, then x could be represented by which of the following?",A,"To solve the inequality \((x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 ≤ x + 1\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 5 (since 5 is positive, the direction of the inequality remains the same):

\[
x^2 + 4x - 11 \leq 5(x + 1)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
x^2 + 4x - 11 \leq 5x + 5
\]

Now, we rearrange the inequality to bring all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 + 4x - 11 - 5x - 5 \leq 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - x - 16 \leq 0
\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - x - 16 = 0\). We can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -16\):

\[
x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-16)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 64}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{65}}{2}
\]

Calculating the roots:

\[
x_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{65}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{65}}{2}
\]

Now, we approximate \(\sqrt{65}\):

\(\sqrt{65} \approx 8.06\), so:

\[
x_1 \approx \frac{1 + 8.06}{2} \approx 4.53, \quad x_2 \approx \frac{1 - 8.06}{2} \approx -3.53
\]

The roots are approximately \(x_1 \approx 4.53\) and \(x_2 \approx -3.53\).

The quadratic \(x^2 - x - 16\) opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive), so it is less than or equal to zero between the roots:

\[
\frac{1 - \sqrt{65}}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1 + \sqrt{65}}{2}
\]

This translates to:

\[
-3.53 \leq x \leq 4.53
\]

Now we check the options:

A) \(-3 \leq x \leq 4\) (this is valid)
B) \(-4 \leq x \leq 3\) (this is not valid since it does not include \(4\))
C) \(-3 \leq x \leq 3\) (this is not valid since it does not include \(4\))
D) \(-4 \leq x \leq -3\) (this is not valid)
E) \(3 \leq x \leq 4\) (this is not valid)

The only option that fits within the range we calculated is:

**A) −3 ≤ x ≤ 4**

Thus, the answer is:

7,,"Find the smallest number of five digits exactly divisible by 22,33,66 and 44.",E,"To find the smallest five-digit number exactly divisible by 22, 33, 66, and 44, we first need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

The prime factorization of the numbers is as follows:
- 22 = 2 × 11
- 33 = 3 × 11
- 66 = 2 × 3 × 11
- 44 = 2² × 11

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor:
- For 2: the highest power is 2² (from 44)
- For 3: the highest power is 3¹ (from 33 and 66)
- For 11: the highest power is 11¹ (from all)

Thus, the LCM is:
LCM = 2² × 3¹ × 11¹ = 4 × 3 × 11 = 132.

Next, we need to find the smallest five-digit number that is divisible by 132. The smallest five-digit number is 10000.

Now, we divide 10000 by 132:
10000 ÷ 132 ≈ 75.757575...

We take the ceiling of this value to find the smallest integer that, when multiplied by 132, gives a five-digit number:
Ceiling(75.757575...) = 76.

Now, we multiply 132 by 76:
132 × 76 = 10032.

10032 is the smallest five-digit number that is divisible by 22, 33, 66, and 44.

Now we check the options provided:
A) 10101
B) 11000
C) 10110
D) 10111
E) 10100

None of these options are 10032. However, we need to check which of these options is divisible by 132.

Calculating the divisibility:
- 10101 ÷ 132 ≈ 76.5 (not divisible)
- 11000 ÷ 132 ≈ 83.33 (not divisible)
- 10110 ÷ 132 ≈ 76.5 (not divisible)
- 10111 ÷ 132 ≈ 76.5 (not divisible)
- 10100 ÷ 132 ≈ 76.5 (not divisible)

None of the options are divisible by 132, but since we are looking for the smallest five-digit number, we can conclude that the answer is not among the choices.

However, since the problem asks for the smallest five-digit number divisible by the given numbers, and we found that to be 10032, we can infer that the answer should be the closest option available.

The closest option to 10032 is:
B) 11000.

Thus, the answer is:

8,,"The entrance fee for a fair is $5 for persons under the age of 18, and 20% more for persons older. Each ride at the fair costs $0.50. If Joe goes with her 6 years old twin brothers, and they each took 3 rides in total. How much money does Joe end up spending at the fair?",B,"To calculate how much money Joe spends at the fair, we need to consider the entrance fees and the cost of the rides.

1. **Entrance Fee**:
   - Joe is an adult, so she pays the adult entrance fee.
   - The entrance fee for persons older than 18 is $5 + 20% of $5.
   - 20% of $5 = 0.20 * 5 = $1.
   - Therefore, the entrance fee for adults = $5 + $1 = $6.

   - The entrance fee for each of the twin brothers (who are 6 years old) is $5.

   - Total entrance fees:
     - Joe: $6
     - Twin brothers: 2 * $5 = $10
     - Total entrance fee = $6 + $10 = $16.

2. **Cost of Rides**:
   - Each ride costs $0.50.
   - The twin brothers took 3 rides in total.
   - Total cost for rides = 3 rides * $0.50 = $1.50.

3. **Total Spending**:
   - Total spending = Total entrance fee + Total cost of rides
   - Total spending = $16 + $1.50 = $17.50.

Thus, Joe ends up spending a total of $17.50 at the fair.
