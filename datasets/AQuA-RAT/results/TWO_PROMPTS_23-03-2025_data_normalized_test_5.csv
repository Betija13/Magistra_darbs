0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \) and the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as \( x_1 \), and the distance when the angle is 60° as \( x_2 \).

1. **Using the angle of elevation of 45°:**
   \[
   \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} = 1 \implies x_1 = h
   \]

2. **Using the angle of elevation of 60°:**
   \[
   \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} = \sqrt{3} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

3. **Distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes:**
   \[
   x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
   \]

4. **Time taken to travel this distance:**
   The car takes 10 minutes to travel this distance, so the speed of the car is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
   \]

5. **Time to reach the base of the tower:**
   The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \). The time \( t \) to cover this distance is:
   \[
   t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} = \frac{10 \cdot \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   t = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
   \]

   Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3})
   \]

   \[
   t = 15 + 5\sqrt{3}
   \]

   Since the time taken to reach the base is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \), the correct answer is:

1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after the coupon is:
   \[
   0.78x - 20
   \]

3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

   First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = 2\left(\frac{x}{2} + 1.90\right)
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80
   \]

5. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   1.56x - x = 3.80 + 40
   \]
   \[
   0.56x = 43.80
   \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{43.80}{0.56}

B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"ANSWER_1: To determine which of the given values is a multiple of \( X \), where \( X \) is divisible by both 9 and 12, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12.

1. **Find the prime factorization:**
   - \( 9 = 3^2 \)
   - \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \)

2. **Determine the LCM:**
   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.
   - The highest power of 2 is \( 2^2 \).
   - The highest power of 3 is \( 3^2 \).

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the scenario where both stocks do not increase. 

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

If we assume that the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of their individual probabilities of not increasing:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = P(\text{A does not increase}) \times P(\text{B does not increase}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the question asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 1 - P(\text{A increases}) - P(\text{B increases}) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30. \]

Since probabilities cannot be negative, this scenario is not possible. Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, considering the events are independent, is 0.1144, which is not one of the answer choices. 

Thus, the correct approach is to consider the maximum possible value under the assumption of independence, which is not directly listed in the answer choices. However, if we consider the closest possible value from the given choices, the answer would be:

\[ \text{Answer: (A) 0.22} \]

This choice is incorrect based on the calculation, but it is the closest to the calculated value of 0.1144.
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: The correct approach to find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is to consider the scenario where the events are independent. As calculated:

1. The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(0.44\).
2. The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(0.26\).

The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases, assuming independence, is:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B increases}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, this value is not among the provided answer choices. The question asks for the greatest value, which implies considering the maximum possible overlap or mutual exclusivity. Since the calculated value is not an option, we must choose the closest available option that represents a realistic scenario under the given constraints.

4,,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula for profit:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}
\]

Given that the profit is 20% of the cost price, we can express the selling price as:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + 0.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 1.20 \times \text{Cost Price}
\]

We know the selling price is Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.20 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
\]

To find the cost price, divide both sides by 1.20:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.20} = 300

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

1. Initially, 20 marbles were painted black and returned to the bag. Therefore, there are 20 black marbles in the bag.

2. In the second draw, 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black. This means the percentage of black marbles in this sample is \(\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%\).

3. According to the problem, this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag. Therefore, the equation for the percentage of black marbles in the bag is:

   \[
   \frac{20}{Q} \times 100\% = 5\%

A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining:**
   - At 100 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 250 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance after it starts raining:**
   - The remaining distance is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - At 75 miles/hour, the time taken to cover 750 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time after rain} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time before and after it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

8,,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"ANSWER_1: To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's define:
- \( P \) as the set of students who attended the prom night.
- \( D \) as the set of students who took part in the debating session.

We know:
- At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, so \(|P| \geq 0.45 \times 200 = 90\).
- At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so \(|D| \geq 0.35 \times 200 = 70\).

We want to find the maximum number of students who attended neither event, which is given by:
\[ |P^c \cap D^c| = 200 - |P \cup D| \]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]

To maximize \(|P^c \cap D^c|\), we need to minimize \(|P \cup D|\). The minimum value of \(|P \cup D|\) occurs when the overlap \(|P \cap D|\) is maximized. The maximum possible overlap is when all students in the smaller group are also in the larger group, i.e., \(|P \cap D| = 70\).

Thus:
\[ |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \]
\[ |P \cup D| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
\[ |P^c \cap D^c| = 200 - 90 = 110 \]

The answer is \(\boxed{110}\).

C)240
D)260
E)280",B,"ANSWER_1: To determine the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total production cost for the year:**

   The company produces 420 units per month. Therefore, the total number of units produced in a year is:
   \[
   420 \text{ units/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 5040 \text{ units}

A)4,000
B)4,200
C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as \( x \).

1. **Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective, so the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

2. **Non-defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

3. **Rejected Non-defective Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

According to the problem, 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.018x = 72 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{72}{0.018} \]

C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.

First, let's find the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos:

- Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

Together, the machines produce yo-yos at a combined rate of:

\[
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ yo-yos per minute}

A)1 step/minute
B)2 step/minute
C)3 step/minute
D)4 step/minute
E)None of the above",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.

Let's denote:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps in the staircase.

**Scenario 1:**
- You walk 20 steps and then stop.
- The elevator takes you the rest of the way to the bottom in 10 minutes.

In this scenario, the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S - 20 = 10v \]

**Scenario 2:**
- You walk 10 steps and then stop.
- The elevator takes you the rest of the way to the bottom in 20 minutes.

In this scenario, the elevator covers the remaining \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S - 10 = 20v \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v \]
\[ -10 + 20 = 10v \]
\[ 10 = 10v \]
\[ v = 1 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

The correct answer is (A) 1 step/minute.

A)21
B)30
C)31
D)32
E)None of the above",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold and then divide by the total number of months.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.

First, let's find out the profit made on each bag. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price, we calculate:

\[ \text{Profit per bag} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the grocer makes a $25 profit on each bag sold.

Next, we need to find out how many bags were sold to make a total profit of $3,000. We do this by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120 \]

A)15
B)16
C)17
D)18
E)19",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (since together they made 35 toys).
2. The total hours worked by Alex is \( 7A \) (since Alex takes 7 hours per toy).
3. The total hours worked by Jacob is \( 9J \) (since Jacob takes 9 hours per toy).

We are told that both worked for almost the same number of hours, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7A \approx 9J \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, express \( A \) from the first equation:
\[ A = 35 - J \]

Substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the approximate hours equation:
\[ 7(35 - J) \approx 9J \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 245 - 7J \approx 9J \]
\[ 245 \approx 16J \]
\[ J \approx \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J \approx 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be an integer, we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

1. **Initial Concentration:**
   - The initial tea concentration is 50%.

2. **First Replacement:**
   - John replaces 15% of the tea with milk. 
   - The amount of tea left after the first replacement is 85% of the original.
   - New concentration of tea = 50% * 85% = 42.5%.

3. **Second Replacement:**
   - Again, he replaces 15% of the current solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea left after the second replacement is 85% of the current concentration.
   - New concentration of tea = 42.5% * 85% = 36.125%.

4. **Third Replacement:**
   - Finally, he replaces 10% of the current solution with milk.
   - The amount of tea left after the third replacement is 90% of the current concentration.

A)8880
B)8870
C)8890
D)7890
E)6780",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students, \( N \), which is a 4-digit number and is divisible by 16, 10, and 8. We are looking for the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of \( N \).

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8:

- The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime number appearing in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \( 2^4 \).
- The highest power of 5 is \( 5^1 \).

Thus, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers divisible by 80.

1. **Smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We divide 1000 by 80:

   \[
   1000 \div 80 = 12.5
   \]

   The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13. Therefore, the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 13 = 1040
   \]

2. **Largest 4-digit number divisible by 80:**

   The largest 4-digit number is 9999. We divide 9999 by 80:

   \[
   9999 \div 80 = 124.9875
   \]

   The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124. Therefore, the largest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is:

   \[
   80 \times 124 = 9920
   \]

Finally, we find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students:

\[
9920 - 1040 = 8880

B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"ANSWER_1: To find out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we first need to determine his speed on a windy day. Normally, Bill averages 15 mph, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Therefore, his speed on a windy day is:

\[ 15 \text{ mph} - 4 \text{ mph} = 11 \text{ mph} \]

A)$27.30
B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the selling price of the appliance, we need to determine the cost price first. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \).

The problem states that the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which means the selling price is \( C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).

We are also told that this markup represented a gross profit of $20.00. Therefore, the profit, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, is given by:

\[ 1.4C - C = 0.4C = 20 \]

To find the cost price \( C \), we solve the equation:

\[ 0.4C = 20 \]

\[ C = \frac{20}{0.4} \]

\[ C = 50 \]

Now that we have the cost price, we can find the selling price by calculating 40 percent above the cost:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.4C = 1.4 \times 50 = 70 \]

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the distance traveled by the jeep, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. According to the problem, the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours. Therefore, the distance for the forward journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, the distance for the return journey is:

\[ \text{Distance} = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance traveled in both journeys is the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

Expanding the right side:

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[ 2v = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ v = 24 \]

Now that we have the speed for the forward journey, we can find the distance:

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it can be expressed as:
\[
R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W
\]

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Therefore, the selling price \( S \) is:
\[
S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R

Substituting the expression for \( R \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W

E)1200",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet and then calculate its area.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \).

1. **Folding along the length:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm.
   - The folded sheet will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of the folded sheet is given by:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the width:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm.
   - The folded sheet will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of the folded sheet is given by:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's solve Equation 1 for \( l \):
\[
l = 48 - 2w
\]

Substitute \( l = 48 - 2w \) into Equation 2:
\[
2(48 - 2w) + w = 66
\]
\[
96 - 4w + w = 66
\]
\[
96 - 3w = 66
\]
\[
3w = 30
\]
\[
w = 10

Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into the expression for \( l \):

B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888",B,"ANSWER_1: To find the diameter of the sphere in which the rectangular solid is inscribed, we need to determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. The diagonal of a rectangular solid with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

For the given rectangular solid with dimensions 3, 4, and 15, the diagonal \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 15^2 = 225
\]

Adding these values:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250

Now, take the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = 5\sqrt{10}

A)3km
B)2km
C)4km
D)5km
E)6km",A,"ANSWER_1: To determine how far A is from the starting point, we can break down the movements into north-south and east-west components.

1. A starts by traveling 3 km south.
2. Then, A travels 5 km east.
3. Next, A travels 3 km north.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km west.

Now, let's calculate the net displacement in each direction:

- **North-South direction:**
  - A travels 3 km south and then 3 km north. 
  - Net displacement in the north-south direction = 3 km south - 3 km north = 0 km.

- **East-West direction:**
  - A travels 5 km east and then 2 km west.
  - Net displacement in the east-west direction = 5 km east - 2 km west = 3 km east.

C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"ANSWER_1: To find the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we can set up the equation based on the given salary structure:

\[ S = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

We want the salary \( S \) to be $1500:

\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Subtract $500 from both sides to isolate the term with sales:

\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Sales} \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for sales:

\[ \text{Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]

\[ \text{Sales} = 20000 \]

D)156
E)452",A,"ANSWER_1: To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Let's assume each side of the square is of length \(d\).

1. **Total Distance**: Since the plane flies around a square, the total distance traveled is \(4d\).

2. **Time Taken for Each Side**:
   - For the first side at 200 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{200}\) hours
   - For the second side at 400 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{400}\) hours
   - For the third side at 600 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{600}\) hours
   - For the fourth side at 800 km/hr: Time = \(\frac{d}{800}\) hours

3. **Total Time**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{d}{200} + \frac{d}{400} + \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{800}
   \]

   To simplify, find a common denominator, which is 2400:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{12d}{2400} + \frac{6d}{2400} + \frac{4d}{2400} + \frac{3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400}

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of white sharpeners.
- Let \( y \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

According to the problem, Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners:

\[ x + y = 18 \]

He also pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is \( b \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( b + 1 \) rupees.

The total cost for the sharpeners is 100 rupees:

\[ x(b + 1) + yb = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ xb + x + yb = 100 \]

Since \( x + y = 18 \), we can substitute \( y = 18 - x \) into the equation:

\[ xb + x + (18 - x)b = 100 \]

\[ xb + x + 18b - xb = 100 \]

\[ x + 18b = 100 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( x + 18b = 100 \)

From the second equation, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 100 - 18b \]

Substitute \( x = 100 - 18b \) into the first equation:

\[ 100 - 18b + y = 18 \]

\[ y = 18b - 82 \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need:

1. \( 100 - 18b \geq 0 \)
2. \( 18b - 82 \geq 0 \)

From the first inequality:

\[ 100 \geq 18b \]
\[ b \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56 \]

From the second inequality:

\[ 18b \geq 82 \]
\[ b \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56 \]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the possible value for \( b \) is 5.

Substitute \( b = 5 \) back into the equations:

\[ x = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 100 - 90 = 10 \]
\[ y = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8 \]

Thus, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
A)8
B)15
C)12
D)6
E)3",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Together, their rate is \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \).

6. **Solve for \( \frac{1}{b} \):**
   - \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)

7. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - Since \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{8} \), hose B would take 8 hours to fill the pool alone.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 8.

E)None of these",A,"ANSWER_1: To find out how much sale the servant needs to make to achieve a monthly income of 6000, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the monthly sale in Rupees.

The servant's total monthly income is the sum of his salary and his commission. The salary is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the monthly sale, which is \( 0.15x \).

The equation for the total monthly income is:

\[ 1500 + 0.15x = 6000 \]

Subtract 1500 from both sides to solve for \( 0.15x \):

\[ 0.15x = 6000 - 1500 \]
\[ 0.15x = 4500 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{4500}{0.15} \]

1. **Calculate the total amount paid back:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid back} = \text{Monthly installment} \times \text{Number of installments} = 31.50 \times 12 = 378
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total interest paid} = \text{Total amount paid back} - \text{Principal} = 378 - 360 = 18

3. **Calculate the interest rate:**
   The interest rate can be calculated using the formula for simple interest:
   \[

Let's assume the original price of the product is \( P \).

1. After a 30% reduction, the new price becomes:
   \[
   P_{\text{new}} = P - 0.3P = 0.7P

4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   0.7 \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7}

   \[
   \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7} - 1

A)Rs. 4400
B)Rs. 4270
C)Rs. 4000
D)Rs. 3937.50
E)None of these",C,"ANSWER_1: To find the man's monthly income, we need to determine what 12.5% of his income is in terms of his savings, and then add that to his monthly spending to get the total income.

Let's denote his monthly income as \( x \).

According to the problem, he saves 12.5% of his income. Therefore, his savings can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Savings} = \frac{12.5}{100} \times x = \frac{1}{8} \times x \]

He spends Rs. 3500 per month, which means:

\[ \text{Income} - \text{Savings} = \text{Spending} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ x - \frac{1}{8}x = 3500 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{7}{8}x = 3500 \]

To find \( x \), multiply both sides by \(\frac{8}{7}\):

\[ x = 3500 \times \frac{8}{7} \]

\[ x = 4000 \]

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

A)4
B)5
C)7
D)6
E)8",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

First, let's calculate how many toys are in one box. We know that one dozen equals 12, so five dozen toys are:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ toys per box} \]

Next, we calculate how many toys are in one tempo. Since there are 98 boxes in one tempo, the total number of toys in one tempo is:

\[ 98 \times 60 = 5880 \text{ toys per tempo} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys. We do this by dividing the total number of toys by the number of toys per tempo:

\[ \frac{29400}{5880} = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. The correct answer is:

A)7
B)8
C)10
D)11
E)12",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work each painter completes and how much work remains after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked.

1. **Calculate the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Determine the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Determine the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work done = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - Total work done = \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - The total work required is 3 houses.
   - Remaining work = \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Calculate the time it takes for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**
   - Mr. Blue's rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - Time required = \( \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{Mr. Blue's rate}} = \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract. The correct answer is (D) 11.

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"ANSWER_1: 
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Determine the total number of smaller cubes:**
   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm, so it contains \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part has a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm (since the thickness is 1 cm on each side), so it contains \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

2. **Calculate the number of smaller cubes that form the hollow structure:**
   - The hollow structure is formed by the outer cube minus the inner cube, which is \(125 - 27 = 98\) smaller cubes.

3. **Determine the number of unpainted faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The smaller cubes that are completely inside the hollow structure (the 27 cubes forming the inner cube) have all their faces unpainted.
   - Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

4. **Calculate the number of painted faces:**
   - The total number of faces for all 125 smaller cubes is \(125 \times 6 = 750\).
   - The number of painted faces is the total number of faces minus the unpainted faces: \(750 - 162 = 588\).

5. **Determine the number of unpainted faces for the smaller cubes forming the hollow structure:**
   - Since the hollow structure consists of 98 smaller cubes, and we have already accounted for the 162 unpainted faces of the inner 27 cubes, the remaining unpainted faces are part of the hollow structure.
   - The total number of unpainted faces for the hollow structure is \(750 - 588 = 162\).

However, the question asks for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted when the outer surface is painted. This means we need to consider the faces of the smaller cubes that are not part of the outer surface.

- The outer surface consists of the 98 smaller cubes forming the hollow structure, and each of these cubes has at least one face painted.
- The inner 27 cubes have all their faces unpainted, contributing 162 unpainted faces.

Thus, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the number of unpainted faces of the inner 27 cubes, which is 162.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided choices, but based on the problem's context, the closest logical answer is (A) 438, assuming a misinterpretation or miscalculation in the problem setup.

1. **Identify the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:**
   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored.

3. **Calculate the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates:**
   - 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.

4. **Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:**
   - If 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed, then 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed.

5. **Calculate the percentage of total chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:**
   - Since 90% of the total chocolates are vanilla flavored, and 10% of these are not squashed, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:
     \[
     90\% \times 10\% = 9\%

A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's denote the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \).

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]

We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \text{perfect square} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

This means \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) must be a perfect square. Let \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Then:
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we need to find values of \( k \) such that \( n \) is a two-digit number and odd.

Let's test the answer choices:

- (A) 47: If \( n = 47 \), then \( 47 + 4 = 51 \) and \( \frac{51}{2} = 25.5 \), not a perfect square.
- (B) 91: If \( n = 91 \), then \( 91 + 4 = 95 \) and \( \frac{95}{2} = 47.5 \), not a perfect square.
- (C) 41: If \( n = 41 \), then \( 41 + 4 = 45 \) and \( \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \), not a perfect square.
- (D) 67: If \( n = 67 \), then \( 67 + 4 = 71 \) and \( \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \), not a perfect square.
- (E) 44: 44 is not an odd number, so it cannot be one of the numbers.

None of the given options seem to satisfy the condition directly. Let's re-evaluate the approach:

We need \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \) to be a perfect square. Let's find a suitable \( k \) such that \( n \) is a two-digit odd number.

Trying \( k = 3 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ n + 4 = 18 \]
\[ n = 14 \] (not a two-digit number)

Trying \( k = 4 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = 4^2 = 16 \]
\[ n + 4 = 32 \]
\[ n = 28 \] (not a two-digit number)

Trying \( k = 5 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = 5^2 = 25 \]
\[ n + 4 = 50 \]
\[ n = 46 \] (not odd)

Trying \( k = 6 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = 6^2 = 36 \]

Trying \( k = 7 \):
\[ \frac{n + 4}{2} = 7^2 = 49 \]
\[ n + 4 = 98 \]
\[ n = 94 \] (odd and two-digit)

Thus, \( n = 94 \) is a valid number, but it is not in the given options. Let's check if there was an error in the options or if we missed something.

Re-evaluating the options, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem setup or options provided, as none of the given options satisfy the condition directly. However, based on the calculations, \( n = 94 \) is a valid solution, but not listed in the options.

According to the problem:

- 8% of the students are interested in Football, which is \( 0.08x \).
- \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket, which is \( 0.8x \).
- 10% of the students are interested in Basketball, which is \( 0.1x \).
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of all these percentages and the students not interested in any games should equal the total number of students:

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Q's age as \( q \)
- R's age as \( r \)
- T's age as \( t \)

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:
\[ r - q = q - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

From these equations, we can equate the right-hand sides:
\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we get:
\[ q = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( q = 25 \) back into the equation \( r + t = 2q \), we have:
\[ r + t = 50 \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \) is already given, we don't need to substitute back to find individual values of \( r \) and \( t \). However, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]
\[ r + t = 50 \]

We can solve for \( r \) in terms of \( t \) from the equation \( r + t = 50 \):
\[ r = 50 - t \]

Substitute \( r = 50 - t \) into the equation \( r - 25 = 25 - t \):
\[ 50 - t - 25 = 25 - t \]
\[ 25 = 25 \]

This equation is always true, which means the specific values of \( r \) and \( t \) cannot be determined individually, but the relationship holds.

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age, \( r - q \), cannot be determined with the given information alone. The answer is:

1. **Initial Cost for the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.

2. **Remaining Money After the First Quarter-Mile:**
   - You start with $8.50 and spend $3.50 on the first quarter-mile.
   - Remaining money = $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.

3. **Cost Per Additional Quarter-Mile:**

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"ANSWER_1: To find the total number of matches played by Sachin, we can use the formula for batting average:

\[
\text{Batting Average} = \frac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{\text{Total Matches Played}}
\]

Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals as \( n \).

Given:
- Current batting average before the finals = 51
- Runs scored in the finals = 78
- New batting average after the finals = 54

Before the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total Runs Before Finals} = 51n
\]

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, the total runs become:

\[
\text{Total Runs After Finals} = 51n + 78
\]

The new batting average after the finals is given by:

\[
54 = \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1}
\]

Now, solve for \( n \):

\[
54(n + 1) = 51n + 78
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
54n + 54 = 51n + 78
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
54n - 51n = 78 - 54
\]

\[
3n = 24

\[
n = 8

E)20",D,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book. The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

We need the total number of unique codes (single letters + pairs) to be at least 10. Therefore, we have:

\[ n + \binom{n}{2} \geq 10 \]

Let's evaluate this for different values of \( n \):

- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letter codes: 3
  - Pair of letters codes: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:

\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \]

Substituting the given values, we have:

\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding the equation, we get:

\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation gives us a quadratic equation:

\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

where \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \).

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[ B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]

The square root of 2401 is 49. Now, substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):

1. \( b = \frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \)
2. \( b = \frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \)

Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:

\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

Now that we have the dimensions of the rectangle, we can calculate the perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(\text{length} + \text{breadth}) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters. The correct answer is:

A)8.5
B)10.5
C)12.5
D)14.5
E)16.5",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: \(9\% \times x = 100\%\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get: \(x = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11\).

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation: \(8\% \times x = 100\%\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get: \(x = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\).

To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated, because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.

- The maximum of 11.11 and 12.5 is 12.5.

Therefore, the minimum number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 12.5 grams.

67,,"Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
A)8
B)10
C)12
D)15
E)19",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many helpers are required to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of large cakes and small cakes needed:

- Large cakes needed: 20
- Small cakes needed: 700

Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so each helper can work for 3 hours.

Let's calculate the total production capacity of one helper in 3 hours:

- Large cakes: 2 large cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- Small cakes: 35 small cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes

Now, let's determine how many helpers are needed for each type of cake:

1. **Large Cakes:**

   We need 20 large cakes, and each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours.

   Number of helpers needed for large cakes = Total large cakes needed / Large cakes per helper
   \[
   = \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33
   \]

   Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 helpers.

2. **Small Cakes:**

   We need 700 small cakes, and each helper can make 105 small cakes in 3 hours.

   Number of helpers needed for small cakes = Total small cakes needed / Small cakes per helper
   \[
   = \frac{700}{105} \approx 6.67
   \]

   Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we need 7 helpers.

Finally, we need to combine the helpers required for both tasks. Since some helpers can be assigned to both tasks, we take the maximum of the two numbers:

- Maximum of 4 (for large cakes) and 7 (for small cakes) is 7.

Therefore, we need a total of 7 helpers to meet the production requirements for both large and small cakes.

However, since the answer choices provided do not include 7, let's re-evaluate the situation. We need to ensure that the total number of cakes can be produced with the available helpers.

Let's consider the total work in terms of cake-equivalents:

- 1 large cake = 17.5 small cakes (since 35 small cakes = 2 large cakes)
- Total small cake-equivalents needed = 20 large cakes * 17.5 + 700 small cakes
  \[
  = 350 + 700 = 1050 \text{ small cake-equivalents}
  \]

Each helper can produce 105 small cake-equivalents in 3 hours.

Number of helpers needed = Total small cake-equivalents needed / Small cake-equivalents per helper
\[
= \frac{1050}{105} = 10
\]

Thus, the correct number of helpers required is 10.

A)12/25
B)3/2
C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"ANSWER_1: 
ANSWER_AS_LETTER: To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain.

1. **Establish the relationships:**

   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

2. **Express these relationships in terms of a common unit:**

   Let's denote:
   - The amount of falafel in one pita bread as \( P \).
   - The amount of falafel in one roll as \( R \).
   - The amount of falafel in one baguette as \( B \).

   From the first relationship:
   \[
   6P = 2R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3P
   \]

   From the second relationship:
   \[
   3R = 5B \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = \frac{3R}{5}
   \]

3. **Substitute the value of \( R \) from the first relationship into the second:**

   \[
   B = \frac{3(3P)}{5} = \frac{9P}{5}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes:**

   We need to find \( x \) such that:
   \[
   2B = xP
   \]

   Substitute the value of \( B \) from above:
   \[
   2 \left(\frac{9P}{5}\right) = xP
   \]

   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{18P}{5} = xP
   \]

   Divide both sides by \( P \):
   \[
   x = \frac{18}{5}
   \]

Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \(\frac{18}{5}\) pita breads.

The answer choice that matches this result is \(\frac{18}{5}\), which simplifies to \(3.6\). However, since the answer choices are given in fractions, we need to ensure the correct fraction is selected. The correct answer choice is not directly listed, but the closest equivalent fraction is \(\frac{25}{3}\), which is approximately \(8.33\), indicating a potential error in the problem setup or answer choices. However, based on the calculations, the answer should be \(\frac{18}{5}\).

A)21%
B)20%
C)25%
D)33%
E)18%",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

With a 20% discount, the selling price becomes:
\[ P - 0.2P = 0.8P \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase required to go from \( 0.8P \) back to \( P \).

Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 0.8P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.8 \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1 \]

\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.8} \]

\[ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = 1.25 \]

\[ \frac{x}{100} = 1.25 - 1 \]

\[ \frac{x}{100} = 0.25 \]

\[ x = 0.25 \times 100 \]

\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the price must be increased by 25% to return to the original price.

1. **Width of the Pickets:**
   - Each picket is \( \frac{1}{2} \) inch wide.
   - For \( x \) pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Spaces Between Pickets:**
   - There are \( x - 1 \) spaces between \( x \) pickets.
   - Each space is 6 inches wide.
   - The total width of the spaces is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Total Length of the Fence:**

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
- \( 10s \) as the speed of the plane in miles per hour (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).

The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts. We need to find the time it takes for the plane to catch up with the ship.

1. **Time for the ship to travel 180 miles:**
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{180}{s}

2. **Distance traveled by the ship when they meet:**
   Let \( t_2 \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet. During this time, the ship travels an additional distance of \( s \times t_2 \).

3. **Distance traveled by the plane when they meet:**
   The plane travels \( 10s \times t_2 \) miles in the same time.

Since the plane starts after the ship has traveled 180 miles, the total distance traveled by the ship when they meet is:
\[
180 + s \times t_2
\]

The plane covers the same distance in the time \( t_2 \):
\[
10s \times t_2 = 180 + s \times t_2
\]

4. **Solve for \( t_2 \):**
   \[
   10s \times t_2 = 180 + s \times t_2

   \[
   t_2 = \frac{180}{9s} = \frac{20}{s}

5. **Total distance from the starting point when they meet:**
   The ship travels an additional \( s \times t_2 = s \times \frac{20}{s} = 20 \) miles after the plane starts.

   Therefore, the total distance from the starting point when they meet is:

The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so the train times are 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population one year from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \]

And the population two years from now will be:

\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

We are told that the population two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Solving for \( P \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

\[ 1.21 = 2 \]

This equation is incorrect, which suggests a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

The population two years from now should be double the population one year ago, so:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Let \( P_{\text{last year}} \) be the population last year. Then:

\[ P = P_{\text{last year}} \times (1 + x) \]

where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year.

Substituting back, we have:

\[ P_{\text{last year}} \times (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{last year}} \]

Cancel \( P_{\text{last year}} \) from both sides:

\[ (1 + x) \times 1.21 = 2 \]

According to the second condition, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:

\[ A + 10 = 3(S - 10) \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ A + 10 = 3S - 30 \]

\[ A = 3S - 40 \]  (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

\[ A = 3(2A - 90) - 40 \]

\[ A = 6A - 270 - 40 \]

\[ A = 6A - 310 \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ 310 = 5A \]

\[ A = 62 \]

Now substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1:

\[ S = 2(62) - 90 \]

\[ S = 124 - 90 \]

\[ S = 34 \]

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The correct answer is (B) 62, 34.

A)30 feet
B)20 feet
C)10 feet
D)50 feet
E)60 feet",A,"ANSWER_1: To find the length of the other side of Julie's rectangular yard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet and one side (the width) is 100 feet. Let's denote the length of the other side as \( L \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

To find \( L \), divide both sides of the equation by 100:

\[ L = \frac{3,000}{100} \]

\[ L = 30 \]

D)412
E)456",A,"ANSWER_1: To find the other integer, we can use the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF), least common multiple (LCM), and the two integers. The relationship is given by:

\[
\text{GCF} \times \text{LCM} = \text{Integer 1} \times \text{Integer 2}
\]

We are given:
- GCF = 11
- LCM = 7700
- Integer 1 = 350

Let's denote the other integer as \( x \). Plugging the known values into the equation, we have:

\[
11 \times 7700 = 350 \times x

83,,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( s \) be the side length of the original square.
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Calculate the area of the triangles:**
   - The area of the rectangle is \( s \times (s - 4) \).
   - Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70\).

4. **Solve for \( s \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
   \]
   \[
   s \times (s - 4) = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s = 140
   \]
   \[
   s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
   \]

5. **Use the quadratic formula to solve for \( s \):**
   - The quadratic formula is \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   \[
   s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
   \]

   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     - \( s = \frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \)
     - \( s = \frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10 \) (not possible since side length cannot be negative)

6. **Calculate the perimeter of the original square:**
   - The side length of the original square is 14 feet.
   - The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet. The correct answer is (A) 56.

A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the new length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio of 5:3.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, it is reduced to 3 parts.

To find the new length, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{New Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Let \( x \) be the new length of the ribbon. Then:

\[
\frac{x}{30} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), cross-multiply:

\[
5x = 3 \times 30
\]

\[
5x = 90
\]

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{90}{5} = 18

A)20
B)30
C)40
D)200
E)None",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and equations.

1. **Understanding the numbers:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \( M \).

2. **Given conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Express \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substitute into the equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a + 297c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a = 990 - 297c
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{990 - 297c}{99}
   \]

6. **Simplify further:**
   \[
   a = \frac{990}{99} - \frac{297c}{99}
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 - 3c
   \]

7. **Determine possible values for \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) is a digit (1 to 9) and \( c \) is a digit (0 to 9), we have:
   \[
   1 \leq 10 - 3c \leq 9
   \]

8. **Solve the inequalities:**
   - \( 1 \leq 10 - 3c \) implies \( 3c \leq 9 \) or \( c \leq 3 \).
   - \( 10 - 3c \leq 9 \) implies \( 3c \geq 1 \) or \( c \geq \frac{1}{3} \).

9. **Possible integer values for \( c \):**
   - Since \( c \) is a digit, \( c \) can be 1, 2, or 3.

10. **Calculate corresponding \( a \) values:**
    - If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \).
    - If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \).
    - If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \).

11. **Calculate possible values of \( M \):**
    - For each pair \((a, c)\), \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9.
    - If \( c = 1 \), \( a = 7 \), \( M = 700 + 10b + 1 \) (10 values: 701 to 791).
    - If \( c = 2 \), \( a = 4 \), \( M = 400 + 10b + 2 \) (10 values: 402 to 492).
    - If \( c = 3 \), \( a = 1 \), \( M = 100 + 10b + 3 \) (10 values: 103 to 193).

12. **Count values of \( M \) greater than 300:**
    - From \( c = 1 \), all 10 values (701 to 791) are greater than 300.
    - From \( c = 2 \), all 10 values (402 to 492) are greater than 300.
    - From \( c = 3 \), none of the values (103 to 193) are greater than 300.

Thus, the total number of values of \( M \) that are greater than 300 is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\).

A)37
B)41
C)40
D)42
E)43",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine Rahim's current age based on the information given about Raj's age.

1. **Determine Raj's age 5 years ago:**
   - Raj is currently 17 years old.
   - Therefore, 5 years ago, Raj was \(17 - 5 = 12\) years old.

2. **Use the relationship between Raj's and Rahim's ages 5 years ago:**
   - 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim.
   - Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(12 = \frac{1}{3}x\).

3. **Solve for Rahim's age 5 years ago:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 12 \times 3 = 36
     \]
   - So, Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago.

4. **Determine Rahim's current age:**
   - Since Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago, his current age is:

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze that entire area.

1. **Calculate the grazing area:**
   The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting \( r = 14 \) feet, we get:
   \[
   A = \pi \times 14^2 = \pi \times 196
   \]
   Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), the area is:
   \[
   A \approx 3.14 \times 196 \approx 615.44 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days to graze the entire area:**
   The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. Therefore, the number of days \( D \) required to graze the entire area is:
   \[
   D = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544
   \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62. However, since the answer choices provided are in increments of 10, the closest choice is 61 days.

Therefore, the approximate time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is \( \boxed{61} \) days.

A)2% Profit
B)3% Profit
C)2% Loss
D)3% Loss
E)4% Loss",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Find the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price.

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP
   \]

   Given that SP = Rs. 27.50, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50
   \]

   Solving for CP:

   \[
   CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we compare this to the cost price of Rs. 25.00.

   - Profit or Loss = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75

   Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, this is a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{0.75}{25.00}\right) \times 100 = 3\%

A)Rs.1560
B)Rs.1680
C)Rs.1840
D)Rs.1950
E)Rs.1690",B,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the information given:
1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We have two equations:
1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( F \):
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), substitute back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180

Now, we have \( F = 180 \) and \( V = 3 \).

For 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3

\[
= 180 + 1500

A)1 hour and 31 minutes
B)2 hour and 31 minutes
C)3 hour and 31 minutes
D)4 hour and 31 minutes
E)5 hour and 31 minutes",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again after starting together. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes each ball to complete one full rotation.

First, calculate the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes for Ball A to complete one full rotation.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes for Ball B to complete one full rotation.

Next, find the LCM of 13 and 7 to determine when both balls will be at the starting point again:

- The prime factors of 13 are just 13 (since 13 is a prime number).
- The prime factors of 7 are just 7 (since 7 is a prime number).

Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: \( 13 \times 7 = 91 \).

Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes.

Convert 91 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 91 minutes is 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 minutes = 1 hour, and 91 - 60 = 31 minutes).

A)15
B)30
C)45
D)60
E)75",A,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's define the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular weekday as \( x \).

Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it orders \( 2x \) newspapers on Sunday.

The cost for newspapers on Sunday is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).

The cost for newspapers on each of the other six days (Monday through Saturday) is \( 1 \times x = x \).

The total cost for the week is the sum of the costs for Sunday and the other six days:

\[
8x + 6x = 14x

We know the total cost for the week is $210, so we set up the equation:

\[
14x = 210

4. Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).
5. The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so each of them contributed \( \frac{96}{x} + 4 \) rupees.

We can set up the equation based on the above information:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \) to eliminate the fractions:

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify and expand:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

3. Cancel \( 96x \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

4. Simplify the equation by dividing everything by 4:

\[
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
\]

5. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0
\]

6. Solve for \( x \):

\[
x - 12 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 8 = 0
\]

\[
x = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -8
\]

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

The correct answer is (A) 8.

96,,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, we first need to determine the perimeter of the original rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Breadth}) \]

Given the length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, the perimeter of the rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (27 + 17) = 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ cm} \]

This wire is then rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side} \]

Let the side of the square be \( s \). Then:

\[ 4s = 88 \]

To find the side length \( s \), divide both sides by 4:

\[ s = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. The correct answer is (C) 22.

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"ANSWER_1: To solve this problem, let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

Now, let's calculate the total amount distributed:
- There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of \( 2x \).
- There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \).
- There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \).

The total amount distributed is the sum of all these amounts:
\[ 2x + 16x + 25x = 43x \]

We know the total amount distributed is Rs 8600, so:
\[ 43x = 8600 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 43:
\[ x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200 \]

Now, we can find how much each daughter receives:
Each daughter receives \( 4x = 4 \times 200 = 800 \).

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

The correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

98,,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
A)12
B)28
C)27
D)58
E)91",D,"ANSWER_1: Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( x \).

According to the problem, Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2x = 58 + x \]

Next, subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ 2x - x = 58 \]

\[ x = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The correct answer is (D) 58.

How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?
A)45 Min
B)75 Min
C)90 Min
D)120 Min
E)60 Min",E,"ANSWER_1: To determine how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets, we need to consider the timing of taking each tablet.

1. Roy takes the first tablet at the start, which is at 0 minutes.
2. He takes the second tablet 15 minutes after the first one.
3. He takes the third tablet 15 minutes after the second one.
4. He takes the fourth tablet 15 minutes after the third one.
5. He takes the fifth tablet 15 minutes after the fourth one.

The time intervals between taking each tablet are 15 minutes. Since he takes the first tablet at the start, the total time to take all 5 tablets is:

- 0 minutes for the first tablet
- 15 minutes for the second tablet
- 15 minutes for the third tablet
- 15 minutes for the fourth tablet
- 15 minutes for the fifth tablet

Total time = 0 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes
