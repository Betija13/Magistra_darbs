D)32
E)None of the above",D,"To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold over these 22 months and then divide by 22.

1. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:**
   - Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.
   - Total sold last year = 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.

2. **Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:**
   - This year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month for 10 months.
   - Total sold in the first 10 months of this year = 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.

Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that:

1. A + J = 35 (since they made 35 toys in total)
2. 7A ≈ 9J (since they worked for almost similar number of hours)

From the first equation, we can express A in terms of J:
A = 35 - J

Substitute A in the second equation:
7(35 - J) ≈ 9J
245 - 7J ≈ 9J
245 ≈ 16J
J ≈ 245 / 16
J ≈ 15.3125

Since J must be an integer, we round 15.3125 to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is 15.

The answer is A)15.

24,,"On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
A)2 miles
B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"```
B)2.25 miles
```
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, given that his speed is reduced by 4 mph from his usual speed of 15 mph.

1. Calculate Bill's speed on a windy day:
   - Normal speed = 15 mph
   - Speed reduction = 4 mph
   - Windy day speed = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

2. Convert 21 minutes to hours, since the speed is in miles per hour:
   - 21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

3. Calculate the distance Bill can travel in 0.35 hours at 11 mph:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes is 3.85 miles.

The correct answer is:
```
D)3.85 miles
```
------
To find out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we first need to determine his speed on a windy day. Normally, Bill averages 15 mph, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Therefore, his speed on a windy day is:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is:

21 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.35 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Bill can travel by multiplying his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes is 3.85 miles.

The correct answer is:

C)36%
D)40%
E)42%",B,"(C)
------
(C)
------
(C)
------
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts:

1. **Determine the original retail price in terms of the wholesale cost:**
   - Let the wholesale cost be \( W \).
   - The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it is \( W + 0.6W = 1.6W \).

2. **Determine the selling price:**
   - The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price.
   - The selling price is \( 1.6W - 0.2 \times 1.6W = 1.6W \times 0.8 = 1.28W \).

3. **Calculate the percent more than the wholesale cost:**
   - The selling price is \( 1.28W \).
   - The increase over the wholesale cost is \( 1.28W - W = 0.28W \).
   - To find the percent increase over the wholesale cost, we calculate \( \frac{0.28W}{W} \times 100\% = 28\% \).

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

A)30%
B)40%
C)20%
D)10%
E)5%",C,"C)20%
------
C)20%
------
To find the reduction percent, we need to calculate the difference between the original number and the reduced number, then divide that difference by the original number, and finally multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Find the difference between the original number and the reduced number:
   120 - 96 = 24

2. Divide the difference by the original number:
   24 / 120 = 0.2

3. Convert the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100:
   0.2 * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the reduction percent is 20%.

To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle given the area and the relationship between the length and the breadth.

Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 4b + 1 \]

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times b \]

Substituting the expressions for the area and the length, we have:
\[ 150 = (4b + 1) \times b \]

Expanding this equation, we get:
\[ 150 = 4b^2 + b \]

Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]

Substituting the values, we have:
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150)}}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \]
\[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]
\[ b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25 \]

Since a negative breadth does not make sense in this context, we take \( b = 6 \).

Now, substituting \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
\[ l = 4b + 1 = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(l + b) \]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
\[ P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 62 meters.

------
C)12.5
------
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need: 
     \[
     \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To meet 100% of the requirement, we need:
     \[
     \frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \text{ grams}
     \]

To satisfy both requirements, we need to consume the greater of the two amounts calculated, which is 12.5 grams.

To solve this problem, let's introduce a fictional character named ""Captain Riddle,"" who provides cryptic clues to help us break down the problem.

Captain Riddle's Clue 1: ""The ship sails steady, 180 miles ahead, but the plane flies fast, 10 times its tread.""

(A) Determine the speed of the ship and the plane:
- Let the speed of the ship be \( S \).
- The speed of the plane is \( 10S \).

Captain Riddle's Clue 2: ""When the plane takes flight, the ship's lead is slight.""

(B) Calculate the time it takes for the plane to catch up:
- The plane starts when the ship is 180 miles ahead.
- The relative speed of the plane to the ship is \( 10S - S = 9S \).
- Time taken for the plane to catch up is \( \frac{180}{9S} = \frac{20}{S} \).

Captain Riddle's Clue 3: ""In the time they meet, the ship's journey is complete.""

(C) Calculate the distance traveled by the ship when they meet:
- Distance traveled by the ship in time \( \frac{20}{S} \) is \( S \times \frac{20}{S} = 20 \) miles.

Captain Riddle's Clue 4: ""Add the miles before, to find the total score.""

(D) Calculate the total distance from the starting point:
- Total distance = Distance traveled by the ship before the plane started + Distance traveled by the ship after the plane started.
- Total distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles.

Captain Riddle's Clue 5: ""The answer you seek is hidden in the choices, take a peek.""

(E) The correct answer is:
C) 200
------
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts with the help of our fictional character, the enigmatic Captain Nautilus, who offers cryptic hints to guide us.

(A) **Understanding the Problem:**
Captain Nautilus whispers, ""The ship sails steadily, but the plane soars swiftly. When they meet, the distance from the start is the key.""

(B) **Define Variables:**
Let the speed of the ship be \( s \) miles per hour. The plane's speed is \( 10s \) miles per hour. The ship has already traveled 180 miles when the plane starts.

(C) **Time and Distance Relationship:**
Captain Nautilus hints, ""Time is the same for both when they meet, but distance traveled differs.""

- Let \( t \) be the time in hours after the plane starts when they meet.
- Distance traveled by the ship in time \( t \) is \( s \times t \).
- Distance traveled by the plane in time \( t \) is \( 10s \times t \).

(D) **Equation Setup:**
Captain Nautilus suggests, ""The sum of their journeys equals the ship's head start plus the plane's pursuit.""

- Total distance traveled by the ship from the start is \( 180 + s \times t \).
- Total distance traveled by the plane from the start is \( 10s \times t \).

Since they meet at the same point, the distances from the start are equal:
\[ 180 + s \times t = 10s \times t \]

(E) **Solve the Equation:**
Captain Nautilus concludes, ""Solve the riddle, and the answer will reveal itself.""

- Rearrange the equation: \( 180 = 10s \times t - s \times t \)
- Simplify: \( 180 = 9s \times t \)
- Solve for \( s \times t \): \( s \times t = 20 \)

The total distance from the start when they meet is:
\[ 180 + s \times t = 180 + 20 = 200 \]

Thus, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 200 miles.
