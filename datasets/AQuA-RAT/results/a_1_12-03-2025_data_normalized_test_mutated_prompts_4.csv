0,,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
A)5(√3 + 1)
B)6(√3 + √2)
C)7(√3 – 1)
D)8(√3 – 2)
E)None of these",A,"To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry and the concept of relative motion. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the base of a tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Setting Up the Problem:**
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the tower.
   - Let \( x_1 \) be the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°.
   - Let \( x_2 \) be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°.

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{x_1} \implies x_1 = h
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{x_2} \implies x_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Finding the Speed of the Car:**
   - The car travels from \( x_1 \) to \( x_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance covered in 10 minutes is:
     \[
     x_1 - x_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the car. Then:
     \[
     v = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
     \]

5. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( x_2 \).
   - The time \( t \) to cover this distance is:
     \[
     t = \frac{x_2}{v} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     t = \frac{10 \cdot \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

6. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:
     \[
     t = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = 10 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 5(3 + \sqrt{3})
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) \).
   - This simplifies to \( 5\sqrt{3} + 15 \).

Since this does not match any of the given choices, it seems there might be a mistake in the options or the problem setup. However, based on the calculations, the time is \( 5(3 + \sqrt{3}) \).",True,,,
1,,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
A)$61
B)$65
C)$67.40
D)$70
E)$78.20",E,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the original price of the item. Let's define the original price of the item as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = x - 0.22x = 0.78x
   \]

2. **Apply the Coupon:**
   The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price after applying the coupon is:
   \[
   \text{Price after Coupon} = 0.78x - 20
   \]

3. **Relate to Half the Original Price:**
   According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.78x - 20 = \frac{x}{2} + 1.90
   \]
   First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(0.78x - 20) = x + 3.8
   \]
   \[
   1.56x - 40 = x + 3.8
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.56x - 40 = 3.8
   \]
   Add 40 to both sides:
   \[
   0.56x = 43.8
   \]
   Divide by 0.56 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{43.8}{0.56} \approx 78.2143
   \]

5. **Choose the Closest Answer:**
   The closest answer choice to 78.2143 is \( \boxed{78.20} \).

By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and solving the equation, we determined that the original price of the item is approximately $78.20.",False,,,
2,,"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?
A)36
B)15
C)17
D)5
E)7",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given choices is a multiple of \( X \), where \( X \) is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. 

### Step 1: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12

To find a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.

- **Prime factorization of 9**: \( 9 = 3^2 \)
- **Prime factorization of 12**: \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- For the prime number 2: the highest power is \( 2^2 \).
- For the prime number 3: the highest power is \( 3^2 \).

Thus, the LCM of 9 and 12 is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^2 = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Check the Choices

Now that we know \( X = 36 \), we need to check which of the given choices is a multiple of 36.

- **A) 36**: \( 36 \div 36 = 1 \) (36 is a multiple of 36)
- **B) 15**: \( 15 \div 36 \) is not an integer
- **C) 17**: \( 17 \div 36 \) is not an integer
- **D) 5**: \( 5 \div 36 \) is not an integer

3,,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
A)0.22
B)0.26
C)0.37
D)0.46
E)0.63",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. This involves understanding the concept of complementary probabilities and the potential overlap between the two events.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Complementary Probabilities:**
   - The probability that Stock A does not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).
   - The probability that Stock B does not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

2. **Consider the Events:**
   - We are interested in the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases. This is the probability of the intersection of the two complementary events: Stock A not increasing and Stock B not increasing.

3. **Use the Formula for Independent Events:**
   - If the events were independent, the probability that neither event occurs would be the product of their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = P(\text{A does not increase}) \times P(\text{B does not increase}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
     \]
   - However, this is not the greatest value possible, as the events might not be independent.

4. **Consider the Maximum Overlap:**
   - To find the greatest probability that neither event occurs, consider the scenario where the events are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot both happen at the same time). This is the maximum overlap scenario.
   - In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is simply the maximum of the two complementary probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = \max(0.44, 0.26) = 0.44
     \]

5. **Check the Choices:**
   - The greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs is 0.44, but this is not one of the choices. Therefore, we need to consider the scenario where the events are not mutually exclusive but have some overlap.
   - The greatest value among the given choices that is less than or equal to 0.44 is 0.26.

### Conclusion:
The greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, given the choices, is \( \boxed{0.26} \). This assumes some overlap between the events, but not complete independence.",False,,,
4,,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
A)270
B)300
C)280
D)320
E)315",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the article given that it was sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360.

### Method 1: Using the Profit Formula

1. **Understand the Profit Formula**: 
   - Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
   - Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Let the cost price be \( x \).
   - Profit is 20% of the cost price, so Profit = 0.2 * \( x \).
   - Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = \( x \) + 0.2 * \( x \) = 1.2 * \( x \).

3. **Solve for Cost Price**:
   - We know the Selling Price is Rs. 360.
   - Therefore, 1.2 * \( x \) = 360.
   - Solve for \( x \): 
     \[
     x = \frac{360}{1.2} = 300
     \]

Thus, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

### Method 2: Using a Proportion

1. **Set Up the Proportion**:
   - If the cost price is 100%, then the selling price at a 20% profit is 120% of the cost price.

2. **Create the Proportion**:
   - 120% of the cost price = Rs. 360.
   - \(\frac{120}{100} \times \text{Cost Price} = 360\).

3. **Solve for Cost Price**:
   - \(\text{Cost Price} = \frac{360 \times 100}{120} = 300\).

Again, the cost price is Rs. 300.

### Method 3: Estimation and Checking Options

1. **Estimate**:
   - If the selling price is Rs. 360 and this includes a 20% profit, the cost price should be less than Rs. 360.
   - Calculate 20% of each option to see which one, when added to the option, equals Rs. 360.

2. **Check Options**:
   - Option B: Rs. 300
     - 20% of 300 = 60
     - 300 + 60 = 360

This confirms that the cost price is Rs. 300.

### Conclusion

The cost price of the article is Rs. 300, which corresponds to option B. Discussing this problem with others or using different methods can help reinforce the understanding and ensure the solution is correct.",True,,,

A)40
B)200
C)380
D)400
E)3200",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the bag, denoted as \( Q \).

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initially, all marbles in the bag are white.
   - 20 marbles are painted black and returned to the bag.

2. **Second Draw:**
   - 20 marbles are drawn again, and 1 of them is black.
   - The percentage of black marbles in this draw is \( \frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\% \).

3. **Understanding the Percentage:**
   - The problem states that this 5% represents the percentage of black marbles in the entire bag.
   - Therefore, 5% of the total number of marbles \( Q \) are black.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Since 20 marbles were painted black, these 20 marbles represent 5% of the total marbles in the bag.
   - We can set up the equation: 
     \[
     0.05 \times Q = 20

C)74325
D)65000
E)97656",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using a specific format: two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Letters**: 
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A to Z).
   - We need to choose 2 letters. The problem does not specify that the letters need to be distinct, so we will assume they can be the same.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition allowed) is \(26 \times 26 = 676\).

2. **Numbers**:
   - There are 10 digits (0 to 9).
   - We need to choose 2 digits. Again, the problem does not specify that the digits need to be distinct, so we will assume they can be the same.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 digits (with repetition allowed) is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

3. **Total Combinations**:
   - The total number of distinct bike numbers is the product of the combinations of letters and numbers.
   - Total combinations = \(676 \times 100 = 67,600\).

Now, let's address the second part of the problem: ""How many letters need to be distinct?"" Since the problem does not explicitly require the letters to be distinct, we assumed they could be the same in our calculation. If the problem intended for the letters to be distinct, the calculation would be different:

- The total combinations in this case would be \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\).

Given the choices provided, the closest match to our calculation with distinct letters is option D) 65,000. Therefore, if the letters need to be distinct, the answer is 65,000. If they do not need to be distinct, the answer would be 67,600, which is not listed as an option. Thus, the problem likely intends for the letters to be distinct, making the answer D) 65,000.",False,,,
7,,"A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
A)10
B)11.5
C)12.5
D)13.5
E)15",C,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey separately.

1. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:  
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Distance Covered Before It Starts Raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining.
   - Therefore, the distance covered before it starts raining is:  
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Distance Before It Starts Raining:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for the first 250 miles.
   - Therefore, the time taken to cover this distance is:  
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{\text{Distance before rain}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}

4. **Calculate the Remaining Distance:**
   - The remaining distance after it starts raining is:  
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Time Taken to Cover the Remaining Distance at Reduced Speed:**
   - The train travels at 75 miles/hour for the remaining 750 miles.
   - Therefore, the time taken to cover this distance is:  
     \[
     \text{Time after rain} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Reduced Speed}} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Journey Duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken before and after it starts raining:  
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = \text{Time before rain} + \text{Time after rain} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

8,,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?
A)27
B)81
C)90
D)99
E)110",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to help us with this calculation.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Calculate the number of students attending each event:**
   - At least 45% attended the prom night. Therefore, the minimum number of students who attended the prom night is:
     \[
     0.45 \times 200 = 90
     \]
   - At least 35% took part in the debating session. Therefore, the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session is:
     \[
     0.35 \times 200 = 70
     \]

2. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**
   - Let \( P \) be the set of students who attended the prom night, and \( D \) be the set of students who took part in the debating session.
   - We want to find the maximum number of students who are in neither set, i.e., \( |P \cup D|^c \).

3. **Calculate the minimum overlap:**
   - The total number of students is 200. We want to maximize the number of students who did neither activity, which means we want to minimize the overlap between the two groups.
   - The minimum overlap occurs when the sum of the students in each group is maximized without exceeding the total number of students:
     \[
     |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| \leq 200
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     90 + 70 - |P \cap D| \leq 200
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     160 - |P \cap D| \leq 200
     \]
   - Therefore, the minimum overlap \( |P \cap D| \) is 0, because 160 is already less than 200.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of students who did neither:**
   - If there is no overlap, then the number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session is:
     \[
     |P \cup D| = |P| + |D| - |P \cap D| = 90 + 70 - 0 = 160
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of students who did neither is:
     \[
     200 - |P \cup D| = 200 - 160 = 40
     \]

However, it seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

- The maximum number of students who could have done neither is when the overlap is minimized, which we calculated as 0. But the choices provided do not include 40. Let's re-evaluate the overlap:

5. **Re-evaluate the overlap:**
   - If we assume the overlap is minimized, the number of students who did neither is:
     \[
     200 - (90 + 70 - 0) = 200 - 160 = 40

   - This calculation seems correct, but the choices do not match. Let's consider the possibility of a mistake in the problem or choices.

Upon reviewing the choices, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement or choices. The calculated maximum number of students who could have done neither is 40, which is not listed. If we consider the choices, the closest logical answer based on the problem constraints and typical problem-solving scenarios would be 27, but this does not align with our calculations.

B)24
C)25
D)40
E)52",D,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use some basic arithmetic to find the solution.

1. **Understand the Commission Structure:**
   - The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale.
   - For a sale of $250, the commission is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Commission per sale} = 10\% \times 250 = 0.10 \times 250 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, the salesperson earns $25 for each $250 sale.

2. **Determine the Total Commission Needed:**
   - The salesperson wants to earn at least $1000 in commission.
   - We need to find out how many $25 commissions are needed to reach $1000.

3. **Calculate the Number of Sales Required:**
   - To find the number of sales required, divide the total desired commission by the commission per sale:
     \[
     \text{Number of sales} = \frac{1000}{25} = 40

D)260
E)280",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the Total Yearly Production Cost:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Therefore, the monthly production cost is \( 420 \times 110 = 46,200 \).
   - The yearly production cost is \( 46,200 \times 12 = 554,400 \).

2. **Determine the Required Yearly Revenue:**
   - The company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue - Production Cost.
   - Therefore, the required yearly revenue is \( 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \).

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Components Sold in a Year:**
   - The company sells 420 units every month.
   - Therefore, the total number of components sold in a year is \( 420 \times 12 = 5,040 \).

4. **Determine the Minimum Selling Price per Component:**
   - To find the minimum selling price per component, divide the required yearly revenue by the total number of components sold in a year.

A)4,000
B)4,200
C)4,500
D)4,800
E)5,000",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define some variables and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. **Calculate Defective Staplers:**
   - 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.10x \).

3. **Calculate Non-Defective Staplers:**
   - The number of non-defective staplers is the total staplers minus the defective ones: \( x - 0.10x = 0.90x \).

4. **Calculate Mistakenly Rejected Staplers:**
   - 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of mistakenly rejected staplers is \( 0.02 \times 0.90x = 0.018x \).

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, we set up the equation:
     \[
     0.018x = 72
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 0.018 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{72}{0.018} = 4000

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If 4000 staplers were produced:
     - Defective staplers: \( 0.10 \times 4000 = 400 \)
     - Non-defective staplers: \( 4000 - 400 = 3600 \)
     - Mistakenly rejected non-defective staplers: \( 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \), which matches the given condition.

A)24 minutes
B)32 minutes
C)36 minutes
D)64 minutes
E)72 minutes",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Machines A and B together to produce a total of 10 yo-yos. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Rate of Production

- **Machine A** produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
- **Machine B** produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

### Step 2: Calculate the Combined Rate of Production

To find the combined rate of production, we add the rates of both machines:

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 18:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
\]

\[
\text{Combined rate} = \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}
\]

This means together, the machines produce \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

### Step 3: Determine the Time to Produce 10 Yo-yos

We need to find the time \( t \) (in minutes) it takes to produce 10 yo-yos at the combined rate:

\[
\frac{5}{18} \times t = 10
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{10 \times 18}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
\]

### Conclusion

It will take 36 minutes for Machines A and B together to produce 10 yo-yos. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) 36 minutes**

### Verification

To verify, let's calculate how many yo-yos each machine produces in 36 minutes:

- **Machine A**: \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) yo-yos
- **Machine B**: \( \frac{36}{9} = 4 \) yo-yos

Together, they produce \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) yo-yos in 36 minutes, confirming our solution is correct.",False,,,

The word ""PROBLEC"" consists of 7 distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, and C. Since we are using all 7 letters to form a 7-letter word, and each letter is unique, the problem boils down to finding the number of permutations of these 7 distinct letters.

The formula for the number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects is \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

For our problem:
- We have 7 distinct letters.
- The number of permutations of these 7 letters is \( 7! \).

Calculating \( 7! \):
\[ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \]

A)0.2
B)0.4
C)0.6
D)1.2
E)1.5",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability. The notation \( P(A/B) \) represents the probability of event \( A \) occurring given that event \( B \) has occurred. For independent events, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

Given that \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) is simply the probability of \( A \). This is because the occurrence of \( B \) does not change the likelihood of \( A \) occurring. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ P(A/B) = P(A) \]

Since \( P(A) = 0.2 \), we have:

\[ P(A/B) = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 0.2

To further understand this, let's break it down:

1. **Independence of Events**: When two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. This is a key concept in probability theory.

2. **Conditional Probability Formula**: The general formula for conditional probability is:

   \[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

   However, for independent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \). Substituting this into the formula gives:

   \[ P(A/B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A) \]

3. **Visual Aid**: You can visualize this with a Venn diagram where two circles represent events \( A \) and \( B \). Since they are independent, the overlap (intersection) is simply the product of their probabilities, and the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) remains \( P(A) \).

4. **Discussion and Estimation**: Discussing with others or using estimation techniques can help reinforce the understanding that independence implies no change in probability due to the occurrence of another event.

By understanding these concepts, you can confidently determine that the probability \( P(A/B) \) is indeed 0.2.",False,,,

- Let \( n \) be the total number of steps in the staircase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Scenarios
1. **First Scenario:**
   - You walk 20 steps and then stop.
   - It takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
   - During these 10 minutes, the elevator covers the remaining \( n - 20 \) steps.

E)40",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of flour the grocer sold to make a $3,000 profit, given that he makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag, which is $100.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Profit Calculation:**
   - The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag.
   - Selling price per bag = $100.
   - Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25.

2. **Determine the Number of Bags Sold:**
   - Total profit made = $3,000.
   - Profit per bag = $25.
   - To find the number of bags sold, divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
     \[
     \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} = \frac{3000}{25}

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - \(\frac{3000}{25} = 120\).

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If the grocer sold 120 bags, the total profit would indeed be:
     \[

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of toys made by Alex.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of toys made by Jacob.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know that together they made 35 toys: 
     \[
     A + J = 35

   - Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
   - Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).
   - They worked for almost the same number of hours, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     7A \approx 9J
     \]

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - From the equation \( 7A \approx 9J \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
     \[
     A \approx \frac{9}{7}J
     \]
   - Substitute \( A \) in the total toys equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{7}J + J = 35
     \]
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     \frac{9}{7}J + \frac{7}{7}J = 35
     \]
     \[
     \frac{16}{7}J = 35
     \]
   - Solve for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 35 \times \frac{7}{16}
     \]

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all three.
   - Prime factorization:
     - \(16 = 2^4\)

24,,"On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
A)2 miles
B)2.25 miles
C)3.25 miles
D)3.85 miles
E)2.85 miles",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, given that his speed is reduced by 4 mph from his usual speed of 15 mph.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Determine Bill's Speed on a Windy Day:**
   - Bill's usual speed = 15 mph
   - Speed reduction on a windy day = 4 mph
   - Speed on a windy day = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

2. **Convert Time from Minutes to Hours:**
   - Time given = 21 minutes
   - Since speed is in miles per hour, convert minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{21 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.35 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:**
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\)
   - Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

4. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   - The calculated distance is already at the hundredth place: 3.85 miles

### Conclusion:
Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D) 3.85 miles**

### Additional Methods:

- **Estimation:**
  - If you estimate quickly, you know that 11 mph is slightly more than 10 mph. In 0.5 hours (30 minutes), at 10 mph, you would travel 5 miles. Since 21 minutes is less than half an hour, the distance should be less than 5 miles, which aligns with our calculated 3.85 miles.

- **Visual Aids:**
  - You could draw a simple graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis to visualize how far Bill travels over time at different speeds. This can help in understanding the relationship between speed, time, and distance.

- **Discussion:**
  - Discussing with others might bring up alternative ways to think about the problem, such as considering the impact of wind on speed or using different units for calculation.",False,,,

A)$27.30
B)$51.00
C)$63.00
D)$70.00
E)$91.00",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Cost, Selling Price, and Profit:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the appliance.
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost price, which means the selling price is \( C + 0.4C = 1.4C \).
   - The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is given as $20.00.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The gross profit is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values, we have:
     \[
     20 = 1.4C - C
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     20 = 0.4C
     \]

3. **Solve for the Cost Price \( C \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the Selling Price:**
   - Now that we know the cost price \( C \) is $50, we can find the selling price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price} = 1.4C = 1.4 \times 50 = 70
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The selling price is $70, and the cost price is $50. The profit is indeed $70 - $50 = $20, which matches the given gross profit.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay after 4 years, including the simple interest on the borrowed amount.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Understand Simple Interest Formula:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount borrowed),
   - \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
   - \( T \) is the time in years.

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Principal (\( P \)) = Rs. 500
   - Rate of Interest (\( R \)) = 6% per annum
   - Time (\( T \)) = 4 years

3. **Calculate the Simple Interest:**
   \[
   \text{SI} = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} = \frac{12000}{100} = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Paid:**
   The total amount Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal and the simple interest.
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{SI} = 500 + 120 = 620
   \]

### Conclusion:
Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years.

### Verification and Estimation:
- **Estimation:** Since the interest rate is 6% per annum, for 4 years, the total interest rate is \( 6\% \times 4 = 24\% \). Therefore, 24% of Rs. 500 is Rs. 120, which matches our calculated simple interest.

A)126km
B)144km
C)127km
D)228km
E)128km",B,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey.
   - The time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours.
   - The speed during the return journey is \( v + 12 \) km/hr.
   - The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - For the forward journey, the distance \( d \) is given by:
     \[ d = v \times 6 \]
   - For the return journey, the distance \( d \) is also:
     \[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

3. **Equate the Distances:**
   Since the distance traveled in both directions is the same, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
   \[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

4. **Solve for \( v \):**
   - Expand the equation:
     \[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]
   - Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:
     \[ 2v = 48 \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[ v = 24 \]

5. **Calculate the Distance:**
   - Substitute \( v = 24 \) back into the equation for distance:
     \[ d = 6 \times 24 = 144 \]

Thus, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

6. **Verify with Return Journey:**
   - Check using the return journey speed:
     \[ v + 12 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]
   - Calculate the distance using the return journey:
     \[ d = 4 \times 36 = 144 \]

Both calculations confirm that the distance is 144 km.

4. **Determine the percentage more than the wholesale cost:**
   - The selling price is \( 1.28W \), and the wholesale cost is \( W \).
   - The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is:
     \[
     1.28W - W = 0.28W

A)1584
B)1120
C)792
D)1320
E)1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of folding the rectangular sheet along its sides and how it affects the perimeter of the resulting folded parts.

Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).

1. **Folding along the length:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the length, each part will have dimensions \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 48 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 48
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Folding along the width:**
   - When the sheet is folded along the width, each part will have dimensions \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \).
   - The perimeter of each folded part is given as 66 cm.
   - Therefore, the equation for the perimeter is:
     \[
     2 \left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 66
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( l + 2w = 48 \)
2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

- Multiply Equation 1 by 2 to align the coefficients of \( l \):
  \[
  2l + 4w = 96
  \]

- Now subtract Equation 2 from this result:
  \[
  (2l + 4w) - (2l + w) = 96 - 66
  \]
  \[
  3w = 30
  \]
  \[
  w = 10
  \]

- Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
  \[
  l + 2(10) = 48
  \]
  \[
  l + 20 = 48
  \]
  \[
  l = 28

Now that we have the dimensions of the original sheet, \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm, we can calculate the area of the sheet:

To ensure the solution is correct, let's verify by calculating the profits:

- **With 5% Discount:**
  - Selling price = \( 0.95 \times 750 = 712.50 \)
  - Profit = \( 712.50 - C \)

- **With 7% Discount:**
  - Selling price = \( 0.93 \times 750 = 697.50 \)
  - Profit = \( 697.50 - C \)

- **Profit Difference:**
  - Difference = \( (712.50 - C) - (697.50 - C) = 15 \)
  - This confirms our calculation is correct.

Discussing this approach with others might reveal alternative methods, such as using a graph to visualize the relationship between discount percentages and profits, or estimating the marked price by considering the percentage differences.

A)$50000
B)$40000
C)$30000
D)$20000
E)None of these",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use a step-by-step approach.

1. **Understand the Salary Structure:**
   - The shop assistant has a fixed salary of $500.
   - In addition to the fixed salary, she earns 5% of her monthly sales.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the monthly sales.
   - The total salary \( S \) is given by the equation:
     \[
     S = 500 + 0.05x
     \]
   - We want the total salary \( S \) to be $1500. Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     1500 = 500 + 0.05x
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract $500 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     1500 - 500 = 0.05x
     \]
     \[
     1000 = 0.05x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1000}{0.05}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 20000
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If the monthly sales are $20000, the additional salary from sales is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
     \]
   - The total salary would then be:
     \[
     500 + 1000 = 1500
     \]
   - This matches the desired salary of $1500.

39,,"An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field?
A)384
B)562
C)458
D)156
E)452",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average speed of the airplane as it flies around the square. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - The airplane flies along the four sides of a square.
   - Each side of the square is traveled at different speeds: 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.

2. **Assume a Side Length:**
   - Let's assume each side of the square is of length \( L \). The total distance traveled around the square is \( 4L \).

3. **Calculate Time for Each Side:**
   - Time taken to travel the first side at 200 km/hr: \( t_1 = \frac{L}{200} \)
   - Time taken to travel the second side at 400 km/hr: \( t_2 = \frac{L}{400} \)
   - Time taken to travel the third side at 600 km/hr: \( t_3 = \frac{L}{600} \)
   - Time taken to travel the fourth side at 800 km/hr: \( t_4 = \frac{L}{800} \)

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time \( T \) is the sum of the times for each side:
   \[
   T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = \frac{L}{200} + \frac{L}{400} + \frac{L}{600} + \frac{L}{800}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Total Time:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 2400.
   - Convert each fraction:
     \[
     \frac{L}{200} = \frac{12L}{2400}, \quad \frac{L}{400} = \frac{6L}{2400}, \quad \frac{L}{600} = \frac{4L}{2400}, \quad \frac{L}{800} = \frac{3L}{2400}
     \]
   - Sum the fractions:
     \[
     T = \frac{12L + 6L + 4L + 3L}{2400} = \frac{25L}{2400}
     \]

6. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed \( V_{\text{avg}} \) is the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{4L}{T} = \frac{4L}{\frac{25L}{2400}} = \frac{4L \times 2400}{25L} = \frac{9600}{25} = 384 \text{ km/hr}

A)10,8
B)9,8
C)7,8
D)5,6
E)11,12",A,"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white sharpeners.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of brown sharpeners.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of sharpeners is 18:
     \[
     w + b = 18
     \]
   - We also know that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \( x \) rupees. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees.
   - The total cost is 100 rupees:
     \[
     w(x + 1) + bx = 100
     \]

3. **Simplify the Second Equation:**
   - Expand the second equation:
     \[
     wx + w + bx = 100
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (w + b)x + w = 100
     \]
   - Substitute \( w + b = 18 \) from the first equation:
     \[
     18x + w = 100
     \]
   - Rearrange to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 100 - 18x
     \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( w = 100 - 18x \) into the first equation:
     \[
     100 - 18x + b = 18
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     b = 18x - 82
     \]

5. **Check Integer Solutions:**
   - Since \( w \) and \( b \) must be non-negative integers, we need \( 100 - 18x \geq 0 \) and \( 18x - 82 \geq 0 \).
   - Solving \( 100 - 18x \geq 0 \):
     \[
     18x \leq 100 \implies x \leq \frac{100}{18} \approx 5.56
     \]
   - Solving \( 18x - 82 \geq 0 \):
     \[
     18x \geq 82 \implies x \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56
     \]
   - Therefore, \( x \) must be an integer between 5 and 5 (inclusive).

6. **Calculate \( w \) and \( b \):**
   - If \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     w = 100 - 18 \times 5 = 100 - 90 = 10
     \]
     \[
     b = 18 \times 5 - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8
     \]

7. **Verify:**
   - Check if \( w + b = 18 \):
     \[
     10 + 8 = 18
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     - Cost of white sharpeners: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
     - Cost of brown sharpeners: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \)
     - Total cost: \( 60 + 40 = 100 \)

D)6
E)3",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use a systematic approach. Let's define the rates of hoses A and B and use these to find the time it would take for hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Define the Rates:**
   - Let the rate of hose A be \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, since it can fill the pool in 8 hours.
   - Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour, where \( b \) is the number of hours it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone.

2. **Calculate the Work Done by Hose A Alone:**
   - Hose A works alone for 2 hours, so it fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Work:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the Combined Rate of Hoses A and B:**
   - Together, hoses A and B fill the remaining \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( \frac{3}{4} \div 3 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Set Up the Equation for Combined Rate:**
   - The combined rate of hoses A and B is the sum of their individual rates: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

6. **Solve for \( b \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{8} \), which implies \( b = 8 \).

Thus, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the pool alone. The correct answer is:

2. **Calculate the Reduction Percent:**
   - The reduction percent is calculated by dividing the amount of reduction by the original amount and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.
   \[
   \text{Reduction Percent} = \left(\frac{\text{Reduction}}{\text{Original Amount}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Reduction Percent} = \left(\frac{24}{120}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   - Simplify \(\frac{24}{120}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 24.
   \[
   \frac{24}{120} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

4. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - Multiply the simplified fraction by 100 to get the percentage.
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\%

A)81900
B)85995
C)85800
D)90000
E)None of these",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population of the city after 2 years, given an annual growth rate of 5%. The current population is 78,000.

### Method 1: Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate the population after the first year:**
   - The population increases by 5% in the first year.
   - Increase = 5% of 78,000 = 0.05 * 78,000 = 3,900
   - Population after the first year = 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900

2. **Calculate the population after the second year:**
   - The population increases by 5% in the second year.
   - Increase = 5% of 81,900 = 0.05 * 81,900 = 4,095
   - Population after the second year = 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995

Thus, the population after 2 years will be 85,995.

### Method 2: Using the Compound Interest Formula

The population growth can be modeled using the compound interest formula:
\[ P = P_0 (1 + r)^t \]
where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial population (78,000),
- \( r \) is the growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( t \) is the time in years (2 years).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 78,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^2 \]
\[ P = 78,000 \times (1.05)^2 \]
\[ P = 78,000 \times 1.1025 \]
\[ P = 85,995 \]

### Method 3: Estimation

To estimate, note that a 5% increase is approximately 1/20th of the population. Over two years, the population increases by about 10% plus a small additional amount due to compounding. 

- 10% of 78,000 is 7,800.
- Adding this to the original population gives approximately 85,800.
- The actual value will be slightly higher due to compounding, which aligns with our calculated value of 85,995.

A)1.5%
B)4.5%
C)10%
D)5%
E)12%",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the interest rate on the loan. The man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   - Monthly installment = Rs.31.50
   - Number of installments = 12
   - Total amount paid = 31.50 * 12 = Rs.378

2. **Calculate the Total Interest Paid:**
   - Total interest paid = Total amount paid - Principal amount
   - Total interest paid = 378 - 360 = Rs.18

3. **Calculate the Monthly Interest Rate:**
   - The interest paid over the year is Rs.18 on a principal of Rs.360.
   - Monthly interest = Total interest / Number of months = 18 / 12 = Rs.1.50

4. **Calculate the Annual Interest Rate:**
   - The monthly interest rate can be calculated as (Monthly interest / Principal) * 100
   - Monthly interest rate = (1.50 / 360) * 100 = 0.4167%
   - Annual interest rate = Monthly interest rate * 12 = 0.4167% * 12 = 5%

Therefore, the interest rate is 5%. The correct choice is D) 5%.

**Visual Aid:**
To better understand the problem, you could draw a timeline showing the principal amount at the start and the monthly payments over the 12 months, highlighting the total interest paid over the year.

**Estimation Technique:**
You could also estimate by considering that Rs.18 interest on Rs.360 is approximately 5% of the principal, as 5% of 360 is 18. This quick estimation confirms our detailed calculation.

E)45.86%",B,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between percentage decrease and the subsequent percentage increase required to return to the original value.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: Assume the original price of the product is \( P \).

2. **Price Reduction**: The price is reduced by 30%. This means the new price is:
   \[
   P_{\text{new}} = P - 0.3P = 0.7P
   \]

3. **Required Increase**: We need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price back to the original price \( P \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let the required percentage increase be \( x\% \). The new price after the increase should be equal to the original price:
   \[
   0.7P \times \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = P
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   0.7 \left(1 + \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1
   \]
   \[
   1 + \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{0.7} - 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1 - 0.7}{0.7} = \frac{0.3}{0.7}

50,,"I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there?
A)453
B)651
C)400
D)487
E)286",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins of each denomination are in the pouch. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and use some algebra to find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of each type of coin (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee).

2. **Convert Rupees to Paise:**
   - Since 1 rupee = 100 paise, Rs. 700 = 70000 paise.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total value of the coins can be expressed as:
     \[
     25x + 50x + 100x = 70000
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     175x = 70000

     x = 400
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 400 coins of each type (25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee).

### Verification:

- **Total Value Calculation:**
  - 400 coins of 25 paise = \( 400 \times 25 = 10000 \) paise
  - 400 coins of 50 paise = \( 400 \times 50 = 20000 \) paise
  - 400 coins of 1 rupee = \( 400 \times 100 = 40000 \) paise
  - Total = \( 10000 + 20000 + 40000 = 70000 \) paise, which is equal to Rs. 700.

### Visual Aid:

- **Diagram:**
  - You could draw a simple bar graph with three bars representing the number of each type of coin, all reaching up to 400.

### Discussion:

- **Estimation Technique:**
  - If you estimate the average value of the coins to be around 60 paise (since 25, 50, and 100 paise are evenly distributed), you can quickly estimate the number of coins by dividing 70000 by 60, which gives a rough estimate close to 400.

- **Collaboration:**

C)Rs. 4000
D)Rs. 3937.50
E)None of these",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's total monthly income based on his spending and savings rate. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Understanding the Savings Rate**: The man saves 12.5% of his income. In decimal form, this is 0.125.

2. **Spending and Savings Relationship**: If he spends Rs. 3500 per month, this amount represents the remaining portion of his income after savings. Therefore, the spending is 87.5% of his income (since 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%).

3. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let \( x \) be the man's total monthly income. According to the problem, 87.5% of his income is spent, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   0.875x = 3500

A)45
B)90
C)120
D)150
E)180",A,"To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \times 8!}
\]

To simplify, we can cancel out the \( 8! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
= \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \times 8!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

D)11
E)12",D,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and calculate the work done by each painter individually. Let's start by determining the rate at which each painter works:

1. **Work Rates:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Work Done by Mr. Brown:**
   - Mr. Brown works for 8 days before going on vacation.
   - In 8 days, he paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Work Done by Mr. Black:**
   - Mr. Black works for 6 days.
   - In 6 days, he paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Total Work Done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Combined, they paint \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).
   - So, \( \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \) houses.

5. **Remaining Work:**
   - The total contract is for 3 houses.
   - The remaining work is \( 3 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{36}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \) houses.

6. **Work Done by Mr. Blue:**
   - Mr. Blue needs to paint \( \frac{11}{12} \) houses.
   - His rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.
   - The time it takes him to paint \( \frac{11}{12} \) houses is \( \frac{11}{12} \div \frac{1}{12} = 11 \) days.

E)35 minutes",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine when both Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again. This is a classic problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which in this case are 16 and 17.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Train A departs every 16 minutes.
   - Train B departs every 17 minutes.
   - We need to find the smallest time interval after which both trains will depart together again.

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
   - Since 16 and 17 are relatively small numbers, we can calculate the LCM by listing the multiples or using the prime factorization method.

3. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 16 is \(2^4\).
   - 17 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(17^1\).

4. **Calculating the LCM:**
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of all prime numbers present in the factorizations.
   - Here, the LCM will be \(2^4 \times 17^1 = 16 \times 17\).

5. **Multiplying the Numbers:**

A)438
B)550
C)500
D)450
E)498",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how the painting affects the smaller cubes.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understand the Structure:**
   - The outer cube has a side length of 5 cm.
   - The thickness of the cube is 1 cm, meaning the inner cube has a side length of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm.

2. **Calculate the Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The outer cube is made up of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (which is not part of the structure) is a cube of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Cubes in the Structure:**
   - The number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Painting Effect:**
   - The outer surface of the cube is painted. This means all the smaller cubes on the outer layer have at least one face painted.

5. **Calculate Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - If a smaller cube is on the outer surface, at least one of its faces is painted.
   - We need to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.

6. **Inner Layer Cubes:**
   - The inner layer of the hollow cube (the 3x3x3 cube) is not exposed to the paint. However, since it is hollow, these cubes do not exist in the structure.

7. **Cubes with Unpainted Faces:**
   - The cubes that are not on the outermost layer will have unpainted faces. These are the cubes that form the inner surface of the hollow cube.
   - The inner surface is a cube of side 3 cm, but since it's hollow, we only consider the cubes that form the walls of the hollow structure.

8. **Calculate the Number of Unpainted Faces:**
   - The inner surface of the hollow cube is a 3x3x3 cube, but since it's hollow, we only consider the cubes that form the walls of the hollow structure.
   - The number of smaller cubes that form the walls of the hollow structure is \(3 \times 3 \times 6 = 54\) (since each face of the inner cube has 9 cubes, and there are 6 faces).

9. **Calculate Total Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each of these 54 cubes has 5 unpainted faces (since one face is exposed to the hollow part).
   - Total unpainted faces = \(54 \times 5 = 270\).

10. **Subtract from Total Faces:**
    - Total faces of all smaller cubes = \(98 \times 6 = 588\).
    - Painted faces = Total faces - Unpainted faces = \(588 - 270 = 318\).

11. **Calculate Faces of Smaller Cubes that Remain Unpainted:**
    - Total unpainted faces = \(588 - 318 = 270\).

However, it seems there was a miscalculation in the steps above. Let's re-evaluate:

- The correct approach is to consider the number of smaller cubes that are not on the outermost layer, which are the ones forming the inner surface of the hollow cube.
- The number of smaller cubes that are not on the outermost layer is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).
- Each of these 27 cubes has 6 unpainted faces.

Thus, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

1. **Identify the Total Percentage of Cocoa Flavored Chocolates:**
   - We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.

2. **Determine the Percentage of Vanilla Flavored Chocolates:**
   - Since 10% are cocoa flavored, the remaining chocolates must be vanilla flavored.
   - Therefore, 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Squashed Vanilla Flavored Chocolates:**
   - We are told that 90% of the rest (which are vanilla flavored) are squashed.
   - So, 90% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.
   - This is calculated as 90% * 90% = 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored.

4. **Determine the Percentage of Vanilla Flavored and Not Squashed Chocolates:**
   - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed vanilla flavored, the remaining vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.
   - Therefore, 90% (total vanilla) - 81% (squashed vanilla) = 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

1. **Daily Progress**: Each day, the frog jumps up 3 meters but then falls back 2 meters. Therefore, the net progress each day is:
   \[
   3 \, \text{meters up} - 2 \, \text{meters down} = 1 \, \text{meter net progress per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate Days for 28 Meters**: Since the well is 30 meters deep, we need to consider the frog's progress until it reaches or exceeds 30 meters. However, on the last day, the frog will not fall back if it reaches or exceeds the top of the well. Therefore, we calculate how many days it takes to reach 28 meters:
   \[
   \text{Net progress per day} = 1 \, \text{meter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Days to reach 28 meters} = 28 \, \text{meters} / 1 \, \text{meter per day} = 28 \, \text{days}
   \]

3. **Final Jump**: On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters from 28 meters, reaching 31 meters, which is above the well's top. Therefore, the frog will escape the well on the 28th day without falling back.

Thus, the frog will take 28 days to come out of the well. The correct answer is:

59,,"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
A)47
B)91
C)41
D)67
E)44",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find five consecutive two-digit odd numbers such that their sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and explore different methods to tackle it.

### Step 1: Define the Consecutive Odd Numbers

Let's denote the five consecutive odd numbers as:
- \( n \)
- \( n+2 \)
- \( n+4 \)
- \( n+6 \)
- \( n+8 \)

These are consecutive because each number is 2 more than the previous one, and they are odd numbers.

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum

The sum of these numbers is:
\[ S = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) \]
\[ S = 5n + 20 \]

### Step 3: Condition for Perfect Square

We need \( \frac{S}{10} \) to be a perfect square:
\[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]

Let \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Therefore:
\[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \]
\[ n = 2k^2 - 4 \]

### Step 4: Check for Two-Digit Odd Numbers

Since \( n \) is a two-digit odd number, we have:
- \( 10 \leq n \leq 99 \)
- \( n \) is odd

Substitute \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \) into the inequality:
\[ 10 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99 \]
\[ 14 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103 \]
\[ 7 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5 \]

The integer values for \( k^2 \) are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49 (since they are perfect squares within the range).

### Step 5: Calculate Possible Values of \( n \)

For each \( k^2 \):
- \( k^2 = 9 \): \( n = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 16 \): \( n = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 25 \): \( n = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 36 \): \( n = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \) (not odd)
- \( k^2 = 49 \): \( n = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \) (odd)

### Step 6: Verify the Solution

The only valid two-digit odd number is 94. Let's verify:
- The numbers are 94, 96, 98, 100, 102.
- Their sum is \( 94 + 96 + 98 + 100 + 102 = 490 \).

A)850
B)800
C)900
D)950
E)1000",E,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the class. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of students in the class.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - 8% of the students are interested in Football: \( 0.08x \)
   - \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket: \( 0.8x \)
   - 10% of the students are interested in Basketball: \( 0.10x \)
   - 20 students are not interested in any games.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The sum of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:
   \[
   0.08x + 0.8x + 0.10x + 20 = x
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   0.08x + 0.8x + 0.10x = 0.98x
   \]
   - The equation becomes:
   \[
   0.98x + 20 = x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 0.98x \) from both sides:
   \[
   20 = x - 0.98x
   \]
   \[
   20 = 0.02x
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000
   \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated number of students satisfies all conditions:
     - Football: \( 0.08 \times 1000 = 80 \)
     - Cricket: \( 0.8 \times 1000 = 800 \)
     - Basketball: \( 0.10 \times 1000 = 100 \)
     - Not interested: 20
   - Total: \( 80 + 800 + 100 + 20 = 1000 \), which matches the total number of students.

A)22
B)27
C)29
D)Cannot be determined
E)None of the above",D,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and use algebra to find the solution.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( Q \) be the age of Q.
   - Let \( R \) be the age of R.
   - Let \( T \) be the age of T.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - The problem states: ""Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.""
     - This can be translated into the equation: \( R - Q = Q - T \).
   - We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
     - \( R + T = 50 \).

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - From the equation \( R - Q = Q - T \), we can rearrange it to find:
     \[
     R - Q = Q - T \implies R + T = 2Q
     \]
   - We already have \( R + T = 50 \). Therefore, we can equate:
     \[
     2Q = 50
     \]
   - Solving for \( Q \), we get:
     \[
     Q = 25
     \]

4. **Find the Difference Between R and Q's Age:**
   - Since \( R + T = 50 \) and \( R + T = 2Q \), we have:
     \[
     R + T = 50 = 2Q = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are consistent.
   - From the equation \( R - Q = Q - T \), we can express \( R \) in terms of \( Q \):
     \[
     R = 2Q - T
     \]
   - Since \( R + T = 50 \), substituting \( R = 2Q - T \) gives:
     \[
     2Q - T + T = 50 \implies 2Q = 50
     \]
   - We already found \( Q = 25 \), so:
     \[
     R = 2 \times 25 - T
     \]
   - Since \( R + T = 50 \), substituting \( R = 50 - T \) gives:
     \[
     50 - T = 2 \times 25 - T
     \]
   - Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:
     \[
     R - Q = (50 - T) - 25 = 25 - T

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since we have \( R + T = 50 \) and \( R - Q = Q - T \), the difference \( R - Q \) is equal to \( Q - T \).

B)12.75 miles
C)17.75 miles
D)14.75 miles
E)10.75 miles",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far you can travel with $8.50 given the cab's pricing structure. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Initial Charge**: The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. This means that after the first quarter-mile, you will have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left.

2. **Additional Charges**: For each additional quarter-mile, the cab charges 10 cents ($0.10).

3. **Calculate Additional Distance**:
   - With the remaining $5.00, calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can afford.
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, so you can afford $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

4. **Total Distance**:
   - The first quarter-mile is already covered by the initial charge.
   - You can travel 50 additional quarter-miles with the remaining money.
   - Therefore, the total number of quarter-miles you can travel is 1 (initial) + 50 (additional) = 51 quarter-miles.

5. **Convert to Miles**:
   - Since there are 4 quarter-miles in a mile, convert the total quarter-miles to miles: 51 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.75 miles.

A)6
B)8
C)9
D)10
E)11",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Sachin's total runs, his batting average, and the number of matches played.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( n \) be the total number of matches played by Sachin before the finals.
   - Let \( R \) be the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals.

2. **Initial Batting Average:**
   - We know that Sachin's batting average before the finals is 51. Therefore, we can express this as:
     \[
     \frac{R}{n} = 51
     \]
   - From this, we can express \( R \) in terms of \( n \):
     \[

3. **Batting Average After the Finals:**
   - After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new batting average becomes 54. The total number of matches now is \( n + 1 \), and the total runs are \( R + 78 \).
   - We can express this new average as:
     \[
     \frac{R + 78}{n + 1} = 54

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute \( R = 51n \) into the new average equation:
     \[
     \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} = 54

   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     51n + 78 = 54n + 54

C)5
D)10
E)20",D,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use single letters, each letter represents one type of book. If we use \( n \) letters, we can represent \( n \) types of books with single letters.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: If we use pairs of letters, each pair represents one type of book. The number of unique pairs that can be formed from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the total number of unique codes (single letters + pairs of letters) is at least 10.

Let's calculate for different values of \( n \):

- **\( n = 3 \):**
  - Single letters: 3
  - Pairs of letters: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
  - Total codes = 3 (single) + 3 (pairs) = 6
  - This is not enough, as we need at least 10 codes.

- **\( n = 4 \):**
  - Single letters: 4
  - Pairs of letters: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
  - Total codes = 4 (single) + 6 (pairs) = 10
  - This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **\( n = 5 \):**

A)60 m
B)61 m
C)62 m
D)63 m
E)64 m",C,"To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle given its area and the relationship between its length and breadth.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( b \) be the breadth of the rectangle in meters.
   - Then, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 4b + 1 \) meters, according to the problem statement.

2. **Use the Area Formula:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \).
   - Substitute the given area and the expression for the length:
     \[
     150 = (4b + 1) \times b
     \]

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
     \[
     150 = 4b^2 + b
     \]
     \[
     4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
     \]
   - This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -150 \).

4. **Factor or Use the Quadratic Formula:**
   - The quadratic formula is \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \).
   - Here, \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), \( C = -150 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     B^2 - 4AC = 1^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401
     \]
   - Since 2401 is a perfect square (\( 49^2 \)), we can solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{-50}{8} = -6.25
     \]
   - Since a negative breadth doesn't make sense, \( b = 6 \).

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( b = 6 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     l = 4 \times 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25
     \]

6. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by \( P = 2(l + b) \).
   - Substitute the values of \( l \) and \( b \):
     \[
     P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62
     \]

E)16.5",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams, we get:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]

3. **Determine the Minimum Grams Required:**
   - To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two values calculated above, because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of grams required is the greater of 11.11 and 12.5, which is 12.5 grams.

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
   - Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
   - The kitchen is available for 3 hours.

2. **Calculate the Total Cake Production Needed:**
   - For large cakes: 20 large cakes are needed.
   - For small cakes: 700 small cakes are needed.

3. **Calculate the Total Production Capacity per Helper:**
   - In 3 hours, one helper can make:
     - Large cakes: \(2 \text{ cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ large cakes}\)
     - Small cakes: \(35 \text{ cakes/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ small cakes}\)

4. **Determine the Number of Helpers Needed for Each Type of Cake:**
   - For large cakes: 
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ large cakes needed}}{6 \text{ large cakes per helper}} \approx 3.33 \text{ helpers}
     \]
     Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to 4 helpers.

   - For small cakes:
     \[
     \frac{700 \text{ small cakes needed}}{105 \text{ small cakes per helper}} \approx 6.67 \text{ helpers}
     \]
     Again, rounding up, we need 7 helpers.

5. **Total Helpers Required:**
   - Since the tasks are independent, we need a total of \(4 + 7 = 11\) helpers.

However, 11 is not one of the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering a different approach or checking for any possible misinterpretation.

6. **Re-evaluate the Approach:**
   - Consider if helpers can switch tasks or if there's a more efficient distribution of tasks.
   - If we assume some helpers can switch between tasks, we can try to optimize the distribution.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Assign 4 helpers to make large cakes (as calculated).
   - Assign the remaining helpers to make small cakes.
   - Check if the total number of helpers can be reduced by optimizing the task distribution.

8. **Recalculate with Optimization:**
   - If 4 helpers are making large cakes, they produce \(4 \times 6 = 24\) large cakes, which is more than needed. We can reduce this to 3 helpers for large cakes, producing exactly 18 large cakes, and use the remaining time of one helper to assist with small cakes.
   - Now, assign 8 helpers to small cakes:
     \[
     8 \text{ helpers} \times 105 \text{ small cakes per helper} = 840 \text{ small cakes}
     \]
   - This covers the requirement for small cakes.

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - 3 helpers for large cakes and 8 helpers for small cakes, totaling 11 helpers.

1. **Visualize the Line:**
   - Let's place the points on a number line for clarity. Assume point R is at position 0. 
   - Since RS = 5, point S is at position 5.
   - We know ST = 22, so point T is at position 5 + 22 = 27.
   - U is the midpoint of ST, so U is halfway between S and T.

2. **Calculate the Position of U:**
   - The midpoint U of ST can be calculated as the average of the positions of S and T.
   - Position of U = (Position of S + Position of T) / 2 = (5 + 27) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16.

3. **Calculate the Length of RU:**
   - Since R is at position 0 and U is at position 16, the length of RU is simply the distance between these two points.

C)3
D)2
E)25/3",C,"To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the different types of bread based on the amount of falafel they contain. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Establish Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) represent the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of falafel in one roll.
   - Let \( B \) represent the amount of falafel in one baguette.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**

1. **Understand the Discount**: 
   - The shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items. This means that the selling price on the discount day is 80% of the original price.

2. **Express the Discounted Price**:
   - If the original price of an item is \( P \), then the discounted price is \( 0.8P \).

3. **Determine the Required Increase**:

   - The increase needed is \( P - 0.8P = 0.2P \).

5. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - The percentage increase is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Discounted Price}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{0.2P}{0.8P}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{0.2}{0.8}\right) \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

D)66
E)54",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the train fare for one person. Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( x \) be the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh.
2. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for one person is \(\frac{4}{3}x \div 2 = \frac{2}{3}x\).

Now, let's set up the equation based on the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train:

- The total fare for 6 persons traveling by bus is \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 4x \).
- The total fare for 8 persons traveling by train is \( 8 \times x = 8x \).

The total fare paid by all travelers is given as Rs.1512. Therefore, we can write the equation:

E)Cannot be determined",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 6 different books on a shelf. This is a classic permutation problem where we are arranging all items in a set.

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Books:**
   - We have 6 books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science.

2. **Understand the Permutation Concept:**
   - The number of ways to arrange \( n \) distinct items is given by \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

3. **Calculate the Factorial:**
   - For 6 books, the number of arrangements is \( 6! \).
   - Calculate \( 6! \) as follows:
     \[
     6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
     \]
   - Breaking it down:
     - \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)
     - \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)
     - \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \)

A)13x/2
B)13x/2 - 6
C)13x/24
D)(13x+1)/24
E)(13x-12)/24",E,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the fence in feet, considering both the width of the pickets and the spaces between them.

1. **Understand the Components:**
   - Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
   - There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

2. **Calculate the Total Length in Inches:**
   - For \( x \) pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.
   - There are \( x - 1 \) spaces between \( x \) pickets, each 6 inches wide, contributing a total of \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Combine the Lengths:**
   - Total length in inches = Width of pickets + Width of spaces
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1) \)

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( \frac{x}{2} + 6x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{12x}{2} = \frac{13x}{2} \)
   - Total length in inches = \( \frac{13x}{2} - 6 \)

5. **Convert Inches to Feet:**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, divide the total length in inches by 12 to convert to feet.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} \)

6. **Simplify the Expression in Feet:**
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{13x - 12}{24} \)

Thus, the correct choice is:

A)238
B)289
C)200
D)287
E)187",C,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define the variables and set up the equations:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( s \) be the speed of the ship in miles per hour.
   - The speed of the plane is \( 10s \) (10 times the speed of the ship).

2. **Time Relationship:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for the ship to travel 180 miles. Therefore, \( t = \frac{180}{s} \).

3. **Distance Traveled by the Plane:**
   - The plane starts after the ship has traveled 180 miles, so the plane travels for \( t \) hours less than the ship.
   - If the ship travels for \( T \) hours in total, the plane travels for \( T - t \) hours.

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is \( s \times T \).
   - The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is \( 10s \times (T - t) \).

5. **Distance Equality:**
   - When they meet, the total distance from the starting point is the same for both the ship and the plane. Therefore:
     \[
     s \times T = 180 + 10s \times (T - t)

B)500
C)5000
D)6000
E)7500",E,"To solve this problem, we can use the method of proportions, which is a common technique in mark-recapture studies used to estimate wildlife populations.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Proportion:**
   - In 2001, 300 deer were tagged.
   - In 2002, a sample of 500 deer was caught, and 20 of these were tagged.

2. **Set Up the Proportion:**
   - The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is the same as the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Number of tagged deer in sample}}{\text{Total number of deer in sample}} = \frac{\text{Total number of tagged deer}}{\text{Total deer population}}
     \]
   - Plug in the known values:
     \[
     \frac{20}{500} = \frac{300}{N}
     \]
   - Here, \(N\) is the total deer population we want to find.

3. **Solve the Proportion:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \(N\):
     \[
     20 \times N = 300 \times 500
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     20N = 150000

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The total deer population in the forest is 7500.

### Verification:

- **Check the Proportion:**
  - If the total population is 7500, then the proportion of tagged deer is:

E)1.5",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Train Schedules:**
   - The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M. So, the main line train arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, and so on.
   - The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, and so on.

2. **Visualizing the Train Arrivals:**

   - This pattern continues every 10 minutes.

3. **Analyzing the Time Intervals:**
   - From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:12 to 5:20, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - This pattern repeats every 10 minutes.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**

- One side (width) of the yard: 100 feet
- Total area of the yard: 3,000 square feet

We need to find the length of the other side (let's call it \( L \)).

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values into the formula gives us:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

To find \( L \), we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 100:

\[ L = \frac{3,000}{100} \]

\[ L = 30 \]

A)56
B)58
C)60
D)62
E)64",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and use some algebraic reasoning.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side of the original square be \( s \) feet.
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) feet by \( (s - 4) \) feet.
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, forming two right triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

3. **Calculating the Area of the Rectangle:**
   - The area of the rectangle is \( s \times (s - 4) \).
   - Since the rectangle is divided into two triangles of equal area, the area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

4. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - We have the equation for the area of the rectangle: 
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140
     \]
   - Expanding this, we get:
     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
   - Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation:
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
     \]
   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Substitute into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - This gives us two solutions: \( s = 14 \) and \( s = -10 \).
   - Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

6. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s = 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

84,,"The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now?
A)18
B)30
C)6
D)15
E)12",A,"To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means to reduce the length of the ribbon in the ratio 5:3. This means that the original length of the ribbon is divided into two parts in the ratio 5:3, and we are interested in the smaller part (since the ribbon is reduced).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, the new length is 3 parts. 

2. **Calculate the Total Parts**: The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

3. **Determine the Length of One Part**: Since the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, each part is 30 cm divided by 8 parts.
   \[
   \text{Length of one part} = \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{8} = 3.75 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Calculate the New Length**: The new length corresponds to the 3 parts in the ratio. Therefore, multiply the length of one part by 3.
   \[
   \text{New length} = 3 \times 3.75 \text{ cm} = 11.25 \text{ cm}
   \]

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the calculation or interpretation, as 11.25 cm is not one of the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the approach:

5. **Re-evaluate the Approach**: Instead of dividing the original length into parts, consider the reduction directly:
   - The original length is 30 cm.
   - The ratio 5:3 implies the new length is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the original length.

6. **Calculate the New Length Using Direct Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{New length} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cm} = 18 \text{ cm}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is 18 cm, which corresponds to choice A.

**Visual Aid**: You could also draw a simple diagram to visualize the division of the ribbon into 5 parts and then see how 3 parts would look in comparison to the original length.

**Discussion**: Discussing with others might reveal that the direct application of the ratio (step 6) is a more straightforward approach than breaking it into parts, which can sometimes lead to confusion.",True,,,

A)20
B)30

D)200
E)None",A,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and analyze the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) is a three-digit number.
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) is the reverse of \( M \).

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Express \( M - N \):**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substitute into the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a + 297c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a = 990 - 297c
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{990 - 297c}{99}
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{10 - 3c}{1}
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 - 3c
   \]

6. **Determine Possible Values for \( a \) and \( c \):**
   - Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits (0 to 9), we need \( 10 - 3c \) to be a valid digit.
   - \( 10 - 3c \) must be between 1 and 9 (since \( M \) is a three-digit number and \( a \neq 0 \)).

7. **Calculate Possible Values for \( c \):**
   - \( 10 - 3c \geq 1 \) implies \( 3c \leq 9 \) which gives \( c \leq 3 \).
   - \( 10 - 3c \leq 9 \) implies \( 3c \geq 1 \) which gives \( c \geq 1 \).

   Therefore, \( c \) can be 1, 2, or 3.

8. **Calculate Corresponding Values for \( a \):**
   - If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 10 - 3 \times 1 = 7 \).
   - If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 10 - 3 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 10 - 3 \times 3 = 1 \).

9. **Calculate Possible Values for \( M \):**
   - For each pair \((a, c)\), \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Calculate \( M = 100a + 10b + c \).

10. **Count Values of \( M > 300 \):**
    - For \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \), \( M = 710, 711, \ldots, 719 \) (10 values).
    - For \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \), \( M = 420, 421, \ldots, 429 \) (10 values).

    - Only the values from \( (a, c) = (7, 1) \) and \( (a, c) = (4, 2) \) are greater than 300.
    - Total = 10 (from 710 to 719) + 10 (from 420 to 429) = 20.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be the total number of students in the school.
   - 20% of \( N \) took only physics: \( 0.2N \).
   - 28% of \( N \) took only math: \( 0.28N \).

2. **Constraints:**
   - The total number of students is more than 501: \( N > 501 \).

3. **Calculate the Total Percentage:**
   - The total percentage of students who took either only physics or only math is \( 20\% + 28\% = 48\% \).

4. **Equation:**
   - Since 48% of the students took either only physics or only math, we have:
     \[
     0.48N = \text{integer}
     \]

5. **Finding the Least Possible \( N \):**
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) greater than 501 such that \( 0.48N \) is an integer.
   - This means \( N \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of 0.48, which is 25 (since 0.48 = 48/100 = 12/25).

6. **Calculate Multiples of 25 Greater than 501:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be Rahim's current age.
   - We know Raj's current age is 17 years.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Five years ago, Raj was \( 17 - 5 = 12 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     36 = R - 5
     \]
   - Add 5 to both sides to solve for \( R \):
     \[
     R = 36 + 5 = 41

88,,"A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
A)51 days
B)61 days
C)71 days
D)81 days
E)91 days",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area that the cow can graze and then calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire area at a rate of 10 square feet per day.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Grazing Area

The cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14-foot rope, which means the cow can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \( r = 14 \) feet.

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (14)^2 = \pi \times 196 \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 196 \]

To simplify the calculation, break it down:

\[ 3.14 \times 196 = 3.14 \times (200 - 4) = 3.14 \times 200 - 3.14 \times 4 \]

Calculate each part:

\[ 3.14 \times 200 = 628 \]
\[ 3.14 \times 4 = 12.56 \]

Subtract the second result from the first:

\[ 628 - 12.56 = 615.44 \]

So, the total grazing area is approximately 615.44 square feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days to Graze the Whole Field

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day. To find out how many days it will take to graze the entire area, divide the total area by the grazing rate:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{615.44}{10} \approx 61.544 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round 61.544 to the nearest whole number, which is 62.

The cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the entire field. However, since the closest choice is 61 days, the best answer from the given options is:

E)4% Loss",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

### Step 1: Determine the Cost Price

1. **Given:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Rs 27.50
   - Profit = 10%

2. **Formula for Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}} \times 100
   \]

3. **Rearrange to find Cost Price (CP):**
   \[
   10 = \frac{27.50 - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}} \times 100
   \]

4. **Solve for CP:**
   \[
   0.10 = \frac{27.50 - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}}
   \]

5. **Cross-multiply:**
   \[
   0.10 \times \text{CP} = 27.50 - \text{CP}
   \]

6. **Rearrange:**
   \[
   0.10 \times \text{CP} + \text{CP} = 27.50
   \]

7. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   1.10 \times \text{CP} = 27.50
   \]

8. **Solve for CP:**
   \[
   \text{CP} = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75

1. **New Selling Price (SP) = Rs 25.75**

2. **Determine Profit or Loss:**
   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{SP} - \text{CP} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the first scenario (540 calls, Rs.1800 bill), we have:
     \[
     F + 540V = 1800

   - **Ball A:** It makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of A} = \frac{26 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 13 \text{ minutes}

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Books**: 45
2. **Hardcover Books**: 30
3. **Fiction Books**: 20

We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. To do this, we can consider the following:

- If all 20 fiction books were hardcover, then the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction would be 20. This is because the total number of fiction books is 20, and if all of them are hardcover, then the overlap is maximized.

- We need to ensure that this scenario is possible given the total number of hardcover books. Since there are 30 hardcover books, having 20 of them also be fiction is feasible because 30 - 20 = 10 hardcover books can still be non-fiction.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Let's verify this with a quick check:
- If 20 books are both hardcover and fiction, then there are 10 hardcover books that are not fiction (30 total hardcover - 20 both = 10).
- The total number of fiction books is 20, which matches our assumption that all fiction books are hardcover.

     \[
     6x + 8x = 210
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     14x = 210
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 14 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{210}{14} = 15
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The hotel buys \( x = 15 \) newspapers on each weekday, including Monday.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{15} \).

**Verification:**
- Calculate the total cost with \( x = 15 \):
  - Weekday cost: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars
  - Sunday cost: \( 2 \times 15 \times 4 = 120 \) dollars
  - Total cost: \( 90 + 120 = 210 \) dollars, which matches the given total cost.

95,,"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
A)8
B)12
C)16
D)24
E)25",A,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define some variables and set up an equation:

1. Let \( x \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
2. The total cost of the picnic is Rs. 96.
3. If all \( x \) friends had attended, each would have contributed \( \frac{96}{x} \) rupees.

However, since four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended is \( x - 4 \).

4. The new contribution per person is \( \frac{96}{x - 4} \).

According to the problem, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( x(x - 4) \):

\[
96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)
\]

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
\]

3. Rearrange the terms:

\[
0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384
\]

4. Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
0 = x^2 - 4x - 96
\]

5. Factor the quadratic equation:

\[
0 = (x - 12)(x + 8)
\]

6. Solve for \( x \):

The solutions are \( x = 12 \) and \( x = -8 \). Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we have \( x = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is \( x - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

The correct answer is:

A) 8

To verify, if 12 friends were originally supposed to attend, each would pay \( \frac{96}{12} = 8 \) rupees. With only 8 attending, each pays \( \frac{96}{8} = 12 \) rupees, which is indeed 4 rupees more.",True,,,
96,,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
A)9
B)11
C)22
D)25
E)31",C,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the wire's total length remains constant whether it is in the shape of a rectangle or a square. 

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**
   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth})
   \]
   For the given rectangle:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} = 88 \, \text{cm}
   \]

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   The wire is rebent to form a square, meaning the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm.

3. **Calculate the Side of the Square:**
   The perimeter of a square is given by:
   \[
   P = 4 \times \text{side}
   \]
   Setting this equal to the perimeter of the wire:
   \[
   4 \times \text{side} = 88 \, \text{cm}
   \]
   Solving for the side:
   \[
   \text{side} = \frac{88 \, \text{cm}}{4} = 22 \, \text{cm}
   \]

4. **Verify with the Choices:**
   The calculated side length of the square is 22 cm, which corresponds to choice C.

### Conclusion:
The measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}

97,,"A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
A)Rs 400
B)Rs 500
C)Rs 600
D)Rs 700
E)Rs 800",E,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and use algebra to find the solution. Let's define the amount each nephew receives as \( x \).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount each nephew receives.
   - Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \).
   - Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - There are 2 nephews, 4 daughters, and 5 sons.
   - The total amount distributed is Rs 8600.
   - The equation for the total distribution is:
     \[
     2x + 4(4x) + 5(5x) = 8600
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Calculate the total amount for daughters: \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \)
   - Calculate the total amount for sons: \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \)
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     43x = 8600
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 43 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200
     \]

5. **Calculate the Amount Each Daughter Receives:**
   - Each daughter receives \( 4x \):
     \[
     4x = 4 \times 200 = 800
     \]

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800. The correct choice is:

E) Rs 800",True,,,

1. **Understanding the Statement:**
   - Meenu says, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let Meenu's weight be \( x \) Kgs.
   - According to her statement, \( x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \).

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
     \[
     2x = 58 + x

   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     2x - x = 58
     \]
     \[
     x = 58
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

5. **Verification:**
   - If Meenu weighs 58 Kgs, then half of her weight is \( \frac{58}{2} = 29 \) Kgs.
   - Adding 29 Kgs to 29 Kgs gives 58 Kgs, which matches her statement.
